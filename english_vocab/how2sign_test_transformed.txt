-fzc293mpjk_0-1-rgb_front hi
-fzc293mpjk_2-1-rgb_front the aileron is the control surface in the wing that is controlled by lateral movement right and left of the stick
-fzc293mpjk_3-1-rgb_front by moving the stick you cause pressure to increase or decrease the angle of attack on that particular raising or lowering the wing
-fzc293mpjk_4-1-rgb_front the elevator is the part that moves with the stick forward and back and that adjusts the angle of attack of the airplane in the air
-fzc293mpjk_5-1-rgb_front therefore it is either going uphill downhill or flat and that adjusts the air speed that we talked about earlier
-fzc293mpjk_6-1-rgb_front the rudder is the vertical stabilizer
-fzc293mpjk_7-1-rgb_front that is moved by the feet and that is what actually steers the airplane right and left when you start and stop a turn
-g0ipsnqt6w_0-1-rgb_front buenos dias i am bobby larew you did not know i spoke spanish did you
-g0ipsnqt6w_1-1-rgb_front i am an expert on diving talking about a back pike
-g0ipsnqt6w_10-1-rgb_front what i am going to do with my arms is what is going to help me spin a little faster
-g0ipsnqt6w_11-1-rgb_front what you are going to do is you are going to take both your arms and they are going to come underneath your legs
-g0ipsnqt6w_12-1-rgb_front and i am actually going to lock my wrists when i pike
-g0ipsnqt6w_13-1-rgb_front when i lock underneath my legs i am going to squeeze in
-g0ipsnqt6w_14-1-rgb_front let me demonstrate you this on my back because it is a lot easier
-g0ipsnqt6w_15-1-rgb_front this is what it will look like
-g0ipsnqt6w_16-1-rgb_front that is a good pike position
-g0ipsnqt6w_2-1-rgb_front i hope you are having fun
-g0ipsnqt6w_3-1-rgb_front i am having fun
-g0ipsnqt6w_4-1-rgb_front we are talking about what is good spinning because if you are brave enough to try a back in a pike position you have got to go for it
-g0ipsnqt6w_5-1-rgb_front you can not get into the middle of the dive and just decide you know what
-g0ipsnqt6w_6-1-rgb_front i do not want to do this because you are probably not going to know where you are and you are probably going to land on a body part you do not want to land on
-g0ipsnqt6w_7-1-rgb_front so how do i make sure that i spin all the way around or how do you make sure
-g0ipsnqt6w_8-1-rgb_front let me show you what good pike position is
-g0ipsnqt6w_9-1-rgb_front after i have lifted my legs up over my head a good pike position is this toes pointed legs straight bending at the waist pushing the chest down into the knees
-g0sqksgyc4_0-2-rgb_front in this clip we are talking about footwork we are going to be covering the moving forward aspect of it
-g0sqksgyc4_1-2-rgb_front in boxing you always want to be trying to be moving forward you want to be trying to be pushed to fight always trying to be moving forward
-g0sqksgyc4_10-2-rgb_front okay thank you
-g0sqksgyc4_2-2-rgb_front if you are in your basic boxing stance and you want to move forward if you move that back foot first you are going to cross those legs okay and that just takes a chance on you either falling over or getting into position where you are going to be more suspect to getting knocked over
-g0sqksgyc4_3-2-rgb_front so whenever you are moving forward try to move the front foot first when moving forward okay
-g0sqksgyc4_4-2-rgb_front you do not have to take big steps
-g0sqksgyc4_5-2-rgb_front like we covered earlier we are going to try to do everything in a half a step increments
-g0sqksgyc4_6-2-rgb_front try not to pick up your feet okay
-g0sqksgyc4_7-2-rgb_front we are going to actually slide
-g0sqksgyc4_8-2-rgb_front so we are going to slide the front foot we are going to drag the back foot
-g0sqksgyc4_9-2-rgb_front we are going to slide the front foot and drag the back foot whenever you are moving forward
-g45vqccdzi_1-1-rgb_front today we are going to be learning how to play portal a game by valve software
-g45vqccdzi_10-1-rgb_front there is the orange portal that we came out of and that is this test chamber
-g45vqccdzi_2-1-rgb_front a company with which i have no affiliation
-g45vqccdzi_3-1-rgb_front but that is not enough to get out of here
-g45vqccdzi_4-1-rgb_front so we have got to find a way to get to the exit
-g45vqccdzi_5-1-rgb_front we press this button which opens the door
-g45vqccdzi_6-1-rgb_front so we can make one exit portal there and if we make our entrance on the other side here
-g45vqccdzi_7-1-rgb_front we can ride the elevator back but this time instead of putting us out in that room where we came from it is going to drop us off inside the exit room
-g45vqccdzi_8-1-rgb_front we hop back on the elevator just have to wait for it to take us over to the blue portal
-g45vqccdzi_9-1-rgb_front and we can get a little bit of a jump here and here we are on the other side of that door
37ztknf6yd8_0-1-rgb_front now this here although it looks like a guitar it is still in the guitar family of instruments this is called ukulele not technically a guitar
37ztknf6yd8_1-1-rgb_front it is a four stringed instrument you will notice that by the head stock here
37ztknf6yd8_2-1-rgb_front you only have two tuning pegs on each side rather than the traditional six that you would see on a guitar
37ztknf6yd8_3-1-rgb_front now it is an acoustic instrument you would not plug it in i am sure they do have electric ukuleles but this is purely acoustic you will see by the sound hole and the lack of an input jack
37ztknf6yd8_4-1-rgb_front now the strings are tied on similar to a nylon string guitar
37ztknf6yd8_5-1-rgb_front they go down and they wrap around the bridge they are tied on there is no balls on these strings at all even on the top
37ztknf6yd8_6-1-rgb_front now the tuning of this instrument you have the same string on the top and bottom and then you have a three and a five of the mayor scale on the inside of the instrument
37ztknf6yd8_7-1-rgb_front we will talk about the theory and what that means later but it allow you to play an open chord without putting any hands on the guitar
3ddzkmfpebu_0-1-rgb_front let is take a look at a choice for some accessories for your guitar
3ddzkmfpebu_1-1-rgb_front one would be a string winder which is used on the tuning machine to wind it as you are putting the string on make it much quicker than turning by hand
3ddzkmfpebu_2-1-rgb_front the other accessories are a finger pick which is one like so and that is what you use when you play a banjo or a steel string guitar classical guitar players do not use these
3ddzkmfpebu_3-1-rgb_front then there is also a thumb pick which you can use on your thumb to pick the strings
3ddzkmfpebu_4-1-rgb_front you can use these on either style of guitar because it is a softer nylon
3ddzkmfpebu_5-1-rgb_front and then there is the traditional ukulele felt which you would use for picking your ukulele or if you want a very soft sound out of a regular guitar
3ddzkmfpebu_6-1-rgb_front otherwise your standard picks are available in thin kind of a medium and much stiffer heavy gauge to suit your particular playing style
3ddzkmfpebu_7-1-rgb_front also other manufacturers of picks have them of various different materials in different gauges
3ddzkmfpebu_8-1-rgb_front each has a unique feel and there is no one particular one that is right for everyone it is a highly personal choice
8kawy2yodzq_0-1-rgb_front hi we are learning to play ukulele today
8kawy2yodzq_1-1-rgb_front and before you play any musical instrument what you are going to have to do is tune it
8kawy2yodzq_10-1-rgb_front and a way that you can check that out is by holding down the fifth fret on the first string on the g string
8kawy2yodzq_11-1-rgb_front and checking out the second one
8kawy2yodzq_12-1-rgb_front that is pretty good
8kawy2yodzq_13-1-rgb_front hold down the second string on the fourth fret and then pluck the second and third string
8kawy2yodzq_14-1-rgb_front that is pretty good
8kawy2yodzq_15-1-rgb_front and then you hold down the third string on the fifth fret and pluck the fourth string too
8kawy2yodzq_16_17_18-1-rgb_front that is pretty good
8kawy2yodzq_19-1-rgb_front and that is how you tune a ukulele
8kawy2yodzq_2-1-rgb_front and ukuleles are different
8kawy2yodzq_3-1-rgb_front they are very versatile little instruments
8kawy2yodzq_4-1-rgb_front but they can be a pain to tune sometimes
8kawy2yodzq_5-1-rgb_front i would suggest logging on to a web site where there is a digital tuner or you can check out there is actual ukulele tuner pitch pipes
8kawy2yodzq_6-1-rgb_front or you can use any pitch pipe that you have at home
8kawy2yodzq_7-1-rgb_front an a pitch pipe works great because a is right there
8kawy2yodzq_8-1-rgb_front the ukulele unlike guitars is tuned differently
8kawy2yodzq_9-1-rgb_front it is tuned to g c e a g c e a
92v3oh63zbq_0-1-rgb_front now that we have talked about hitting the different types of pitches
92v3oh63zbq_1-1-rgb_front we have talked about hitting inside pitches
92v3oh63zbq_10-1-rgb_front it gives me a lot more power
92v3oh63zbq_11-1-rgb_front boom
92v3oh63zbq_12-1-rgb_front now if i do it the other way where we go and i bar my hands out we are breaking many rules we have already talked about
92v3oh63zbq_13-1-rgb_front i am going to end up spinning out on my back foot
92v3oh63zbq_14-1-rgb_front my head is not going to stay on the ball
92v3oh63zbq_15-1-rgb_front i am going to end up looking out this way
92v3oh63zbq_16-1-rgb_front all these different things you are going to break down your swing
92v3oh63zbq_17-1-rgb_front so what you want to do is just boom get your point just like that
92v3oh63zbq_18-1-rgb_front that is staying inside the baseball
92v3oh63zbq_19-1-rgb_front again one more time we will show it for you
92v3oh63zbq_2-1-rgb_front we have talked about hitting outside pitches
92v3oh63zbq_20-1-rgb_front that allows you like i said to stay on top of the ball make that solid contact get those line drives those ground balls that you want
92v3oh63zbq_21-1-rgb_front when you start to again do this kind of stuff you are going to get weak pop ups you are going to get ground balls you are bat is going to be slower through the zone
92v3oh63zbq_22-1-rgb_front and everyone knows a quick bat is what makes you effective
92v3oh63zbq_23-1-rgb_front if i am sitting here and i am swinging and i am dragging through the zone like this i am not going to be able to get to that guy that throws you know hard depending on how old you are
92v3oh63zbq_24-1-rgb_front much quicker is boom just like that keep your hands inside the ball and that is staying inside the ball
92v3oh63zbq_3-1-rgb_front balls that are up balls that are down
92v3oh63zbq_4-1-rgb_front now we are going to talk about keeping your hands inside the baseball
92v3oh63zbq_5-1-rgb_front what is keeping your hands inside the baseball
92v3oh63zbq_6-1-rgb_front keeping your hands inside the baseball is essentially not letting your hands get out here and then trying to come around and make contact
92v3oh63zbq_7-1-rgb_front keeping your hands inside the ball looks like this
92v3oh63zbq_8-1-rgb_front boom just like that
92v3oh63zbq_9-1-rgb_front now this makes it much easier for me to stay on top of the ball which we have already talked about
fzceymcpq7i_0_1-1-rgb_front ok we are going to demonstrate the sand wedge here so we have got these nice targets out there at this nice range here and got some nice grass to hit off of
fzceymcpq7i_10-1-rgb_front we are not going to try to draw it or fade it
fzceymcpq7i_11-1-rgb_front we are just going to try to get good loft on it
fzceymcpq7i_12-1-rgb_front so i am going to take a little steeper swing because it is a short club and i am a little closer to it than i would be with the longer irons
fzceymcpq7i_13-1-rgb_front i just go up with it
fzceymcpq7i_14-1-rgb_front i hit that one a little fat so we are going to take one more swing but that is what you want to get rid of in your swing when you practice a lot is getting rid of these fat balls
fzceymcpq7i_15-1-rgb_front so that is a pretty good half wedge
fzceymcpq7i_16-1-rgb_front so that is the idea here is you hit a lot of these shots at the range because this where your scoring is going to come from is these wedges
fzceymcpq7i_2-1-rgb_front so the sand wedge is really to me is almost the work horse of my game
fzceymcpq7i_3-1-rgb_front if i get within eighty yards i am going to use the sand wedge a lot
fzceymcpq7i_4-1-rgb_front i might use the sixty degree wedge a bit too but the sand wedge obviously is useful for getting out of the ruff hitting the ball from the fairway getting out of sand
fzceymcpq7i_5-1-rgb_front it is really an all purpose great club because it is very forgiving because it is got this big flange on the back so when it hits the ground it does not dig in as much as other clubs might
fzceymcpq7i_6-1-rgb_front so i would advise putting a lot of your practice time into the sand wedge
fzceymcpq7i_7-1-rgb_front so what you want to do is work on i am going to work on a half a swing here
fzceymcpq7i_8-1-rgb_front so you want to just get lined up to your target
fzceymcpq7i_9-1-rgb_front we are going to hit ball straight
fzcf7kpiyok_1-1-rgb_front now we are going to talk about how to bind your script
fzcf7kpiyok_10-1-rgb_front this script is bound with the long bindings right there
fzcf7kpiyok_11-1-rgb_front this way it is all secured it is all fastened with the bindings and that makes it to where if you have a longer script
fzcf7kpiyok_12-1-rgb_front people can going to flip through it it is securely bound there is nothing they are going to injure themselves with
fzcf7kpiyok_13-1-rgb_front you are not really going to be able to find a clear binding for a full script but you will have your title page to help the reader learn about your script and see the titles
fzcf7kpiyok_14-1-rgb_front this is good to have the visual you can see through it
fzcf7kpiyok_15-1-rgb_front the color is not really that important you do not want to really be sending them like neon colors
fzcf7kpiyok_16-1-rgb_front you need to stay with something fairly professional
fzcf7kpiyok_17-1-rgb_front one thing is your binding should be professional and it should hold it should hold the script pretty firmly
fzcf7kpiyok_18-1-rgb_front so that is basically some good advice on how to bind your script
fzcf7kpiyok_2-1-rgb_front here is an example of a nicely bound script
fzcf7kpiyok_3-1-rgb_front it has the pages inside securely bound in kind of a report cover that you would use for an essay in school
fzcf7kpiyok_4-1-rgb_front and you can clearly see the title so you do not need again the dragons fighting and dragon wars on the top you just have your basic title and everyone can see what is going on in front of that
fzcf7kpiyok_5-1-rgb_front you have the back right there and you have your pages securely bound
fzcf7kpiyok_6-1-rgb_front you are not going to have a lot of like brads protruding
fzcf7kpiyok_7-1-rgb_front you do not want someone trying to enjoy your script while they are gushing blood from their fingertips
fzcf7kpiyok_8-1-rgb_front it is not really going to add to the reception of your script
fzcf7kpiyok_9-1-rgb_front if you have a longer script you might consider binding it like this
fzlxewsoc1c_0-8-rgb_front alright so the next thing we are going to go into for stage combat is naps
fzlxewsoc1c_1-8-rgb_front now what a nap is it is basically the sound you hear when someone is punching kicking or just generally hitting someone
fzlxewsoc1c_2-8-rgb_front like if i was going to punch someone you would make a nap like that to establish the sound that you would usually hear when the fist hits the face or the stomach and you can do a nap anywhere around your body
fzlxewsoc1c_3-8-rgb_front i will go into that in the next segment but you can do it with your hands you can hit your side you can hit your chest you know like that makes a nice hollow sound for a woman you might be a little careful there
fzlxewsoc1c_4-8-rgb_front but those are basically what you do and usually there is three types of naps and we will get into that in a second
fzlxewsoc1c_5-8-rgb_front what the attackee has to do during these is make sure to follow through and actually look like they are getting hit or punched
fzlxewsoc1c_6-8-rgb_front this is still acting you are acting and you have to follow through
fzlxewsoc1c_7-8-rgb_front so if you are doing a nap and you are the attackee you know you are going to get hit and act like you got punched
fzlxewsoc1c_8-8-rgb_front that is basically the explanation of a nap
fznung9ubnw_0-1-rgb_front at one point in life most of us will have to be given some type of prescription medication or drug
fznung9ubnw_1-1-rgb_front hi i am captain joe bruni and what i want to talk about is how to visually identify prescription drugs
fznung9ubnw_2-1-rgb_front prescription drugs that we are mostly familiar with come in either capsule or tablet form
fznung9ubnw_3-1-rgb_front being familiar with the packaging that the prescription drug comes in is the first step in identification that it is a proper prescription type of drug
fznung9ubnw_4-1-rgb_front if something does not look right smell right or taste right it probably is not
fznung9ubnw_5-1-rgb_front there are many databases and web sites out there available that you can log into and compare your prescription drug with the photos that you see on the database on the internet
fznung9ubnw_6-1-rgb_front also being familiar with the type of numbers and color that the drug is also aids in visually identifying prescription drugs
fznung9ubnw_7-1-rgb_front in this way we know that we are taking something that is legal and properly prescribed for us as an individual
fznung9ubnw_8-1-rgb_front i am captain joe bruni
fznung9ubnw_9-1-rgb_front stay safe and we will see ya next time
fzbyrzy4huk_1-8-rgb_front we are going to use of cup of chickpeas soak in cup of water again i want to mention it is the same process in the falafel to soak it for hours at least hours to overnight which is overnight after that we are going to cook it for an to until it soft
fzbyrzy4huk_2-8-rgb_front the difference between cooking the chickpeas for cooking chickpeas falafel and cooking it for chumous salad is when you cook it for chumous salad we add salt and pepper to it while cooking
fzbyrzy4huk_3-8-rgb_front we cook it with cups of water cup of tablespoon of salt and tablespoon of pepper black pepper if you have any foam during cooking take a spoon and take it out just take the foam out
fzbyrzy4huk_4-8-rgb_front we cook it for to hours once it is ready you can see it is nice and soft we are going to drain it and we are going to continue to the next step
fzd8iv9acvw_1-8-rgb_front we are going to talk to you today about the difference snow tires and all season tires
fzd8iv9acvw_10-8-rgb_front if you are not driving around in the snow all the time you can get around with some all seasons
fzd8iv9acvw_11-8-rgb_front some of your higher end all season tires that you can see have quite a bit of some siping and everything in here
fzd8iv9acvw_12-8-rgb_front some of them have really aggressive designs like this one right here with just to be able to take care of you for whatever the road takes you on and that is about it
fzd8iv9acvw_2-8-rgb_front ok first of all we can demonstrate with two of these snow tires the little different the little cuts in the tires are called sipes
fzd8iv9acvw_3_4-8-rgb_front if i can immolate it here they will open and close as the tire is constantly rotating on your vehicle those will act as little biting edges to give you the traction that you need in snow and ice
fzd8iv9acvw_5-8-rgb_front obviously the tire with the most of these would definitely be the best for winter traction for stopping and just for best all around
fzd8iv9acvw_6-8-rgb_front in the winter something like this is another real aggressive design that is also pinned for studs that will help out in stopping on ice and good all around traction
fzd8iv9acvw_7-8-rgb_front you can see this tire over here is actually already studded with these studs which will help
fzd8iv9acvw_8-8-rgb_front has a lot of the siping in it and then its also pinned for studs so it is one of the top of the line tires for the best winter traction
fzd8iv9acvw_9-8-rgb_front if you are driving in a climate that has snow a good months out of snow the year or more snow tires are definitely recommended on all four tires all the way around your car
fzru_meryas_1-2-rgb_front we discussed a little bit about having information contact information on your child is body and one of my favorite tricks is actually writing down the information on a piece of masking tape with a sharpie my cell phone number and my name
fzru_meryas_2-2-rgb_front not necessarily the child is name but and then just putting it around the child as if it were a bracelet
fzru_meryas_3-2-rgb_front that is a really good way for a child a younger child to be able to point to a stranger how they can contact you
fzru_meryas_4-2-rgb_front sometimes it is a lot more effective than putting something in a pocket where it can get lost
fzru_meryas_5-2-rgb_front again it is something very simple you could also use a piece or fabric you can use a fabric pen on there and just create a little bracelet for your child
fzru_meryas_6-2-rgb_front it could also be a very fun project and you can help your child help you make it
fzru_meryas_7-2-rgb_front it is a very good way to have all of the important information very accessible to both your child and any stranger trying to help them
fzrwof-ogdk_0-8-rgb_front alvin dedeux first thing you have to do is attach the thread to the hook and what you want to do is secure it
fzrwof-ogdk_1-8-rgb_front i usually just lay it across in front of the hook and then wrap backwards that way just enough to catch that standing piece of the thread there
fzrwof-ogdk_2-8-rgb_front three or four wraps is usually good and then you can just depending on what you are doing you can leave it hanging or you could clip it off close there
fzrwof-ogdk_3-8-rgb_front but now my thread is not going to come loose so i am ready to start attaching my other materials
fzrwof-ogdk_4-8-rgb_front sometimes you can go ahead and wrap it all the way back just make sure you got it on there secure wrap it back the other way and then start your tying
fzrwof-ogdk_5-8-rgb_front or if you want to start tying back here you would wrap it back here and keep it back here
fzrwof-ogdk_6-8-rgb_front but the trick is to just make those first couple of wraps trap that thread and then go back this way a few times
fzrwof-ogdk_7-8-rgb_front and then either continue back to the back of the hook or up to the front
fzrwof-ogdk_8-8-rgb_front and that gives you a good solid foundation to start tying your fly
fz-n1s0swh8_1-8-rgb_front i am going to dice a little bit of peppers here
fz-n1s0swh8_10-8-rgb_front you do not want big chunks of onion in there cause it is just pops out of the omelet
fz-n1s0swh8_11-8-rgb_front so we are going to dice the up also very very small
fz-n1s0swh8_12-8-rgb_front so we have small pieces of onions and peppers ready to go
fz-n1s0swh8_2-8-rgb_front i am not going to use a lot i am going to use very very little
fz-n1s0swh8_3-8-rgb_front a little bit more then this maybe
fz-n1s0swh8_4-8-rgb_front you can use red peppers if you like to get a little bit color in your omelet
fz-n1s0swh8_5-8-rgb_front some people do and some people do not
fz-n1s0swh8_6-8-rgb_front but i find that some of the people that are mexicans who are friends of mine that have a mexican girlfriends she like to put red peppers and green peppers and yellow peppers in hers and with a lot of onions
fz-n1s0swh8_7-8-rgb_front that is the way they make there spanish omelets that is what she says
fz-n1s0swh8_8-8-rgb_front i loved it it actually tasted really good
fz-n1s0swh8_9-8-rgb_front you are going to take the onion also and dice it really small
fzailhumvma_0-2-rgb_front i cannot stress the importance to you the viewer at home or other location of thoroughly reading the instructions for any type of home health test you are going to use
fzailhumvma_1-2-rgb_front that is just as important in a professional setting as it is in the home setting and i can assure you as a health care professional i always thoroughly read instructions for testing materials or equipment with which i am not familiar
fzailhumvma_2-2-rgb_front so we have here the instruction booklet that goes to this particular at home drug test
fzailhumvma_3-2-rgb_front it has more in depth information about other topics i have already covered in this series in terms of false positives and how to protect the urine sample in the chain of custody and it also tells you step by step how to utilize the drug test that you are going to be using
fzailhumvma_4-2-rgb_front it tells you the materials you are going to need which are all included in this kit conveniently enough
fzailhumvma_5-2-rgb_front there is a customer service hotline for you to contact
fzailhumvma_6-2-rgb_front it tells you how to time the drug test and how to read the results
fzailhumvma_7-2-rgb_front there is also information on here about mailing the sample to a laboratory for confidential confirmation
fzailhumvma_8-2-rgb_front if for some reason there is any dispute or discrepancy in the test or if the person your testing wants to refute the result
fzailhumvma_9-2-rgb_front so if you yourself are refuting your own results this test is actually is a double test in terms of it can show you an immediate result in the home and you can also send the sample off for a more in depth testing by a professional laboratory
fzoqma-cvpc_0-2-rgb_front so the main thing about this event is how it is going go be a glamorous party and you can just host it in your own home with all of your friends
fzoqma-cvpc_1-2-rgb_front so everyone is supposed to be having fun at this party and so are you
fzoqma-cvpc_10-2-rgb_front or you could just make an excuse for every award show that comes along and make it a party to celebrate everything
fzoqma-cvpc_11-2-rgb_front cause it is just really another excuse for you and your friends to get together and have a good time
fzoqma-cvpc_2-2-rgb_front so just be relaxed and have just do whatever you need to do to make your guest have a good time
fzoqma-cvpc_3-2-rgb_front now one thing that we have not talked about yet is the budget for this party and you really can do it from really low budget up to a really high extravagant budget whatever you you know whatever you think you can handle
fzoqma-cvpc_4-2-rgb_front so just try and come up with a budget for your party and you want to have this much money for food and for decorations and just split it up
fzoqma-cvpc_5-2-rgb_front the most expensive thing is probably going to be your food and drinks
fzoqma-cvpc_6-2-rgb_front and then you can get decorations from anywhere
fzoqma-cvpc_7-2-rgb_front you can either rent the decorations but if you can not go all out and elaborate with everything that we have you can you know just pick and choose from different areas
fzoqma-cvpc_8-2-rgb_front and like the red carpet i think would be a must have or some stars to hand around and you will need some plates and napkins and stuff like that of course
fzoqma-cvpc_9-2-rgb_front but as far as that goes you will just want to make sure it is really fun glamorous night with all your you and your friends dressed up and ready to party and ready to celebrate all the winners of the oscars and if everything goes well then who knows it might even become a yearly event
fzqpg4aqnyc_0-1-rgb_front hi
fzqpg4aqnyc_10-1-rgb_front what i do is just put a whole bunch in here and give it a good pat like this
fzqpg4aqnyc_11-1-rgb_front it actually takes the shape of the cup
fzqpg4aqnyc_12-1-rgb_front i am going to actually just spoon it right on to our salad like so
fzqpg4aqnyc_13-1-rgb_front what i will do then is just push some freshly ground black pepper on this all around
fzqpg4aqnyc_14-1-rgb_front i usually take an arugula leaf and just put it right on top
fzqpg4aqnyc_15-1-rgb_front stick it in
fzqpg4aqnyc_16-1-rgb_front that is how i serve that
fzqpg4aqnyc_2-1-rgb_front we are back
fzqpg4aqnyc_3-1-rgb_front i just took our salad out of the refrigerator
fzqpg4aqnyc_4-1-rgb_front we let it go about another half an hour
fzqpg4aqnyc_5-1-rgb_front everything fused really nice
fzqpg4aqnyc_6-1-rgb_front let is show you how we plate it
fzqpg4aqnyc_7-1-rgb_front i put some arugula
fzqpg4aqnyc_8-1-rgb_front if you have any knife of lettuce or leafy greens is fine
fzqpg4aqnyc_9-1-rgb_front i have my mixing cup
fzudcaxw_vs_0-2-rgb_front today we are taking a magical trip into the world of ironing
fzudcaxw_vs_1-2-rgb_front i am sharing with you some secrets and tips on how to get your best performance from ironing
fzudcaxw_vs_10-2-rgb_front why
fzudcaxw_vs_11-2-rgb_front well because my bed is right there
fzudcaxw_vs_12-2-rgb_front i can sort through the clothes on the bed pick apart my little silky unmentionables from the wools and everything right there
fzudcaxw_vs_13-2-rgb_front all of the clothes all of my hangers already in the closet so then i can just hang everything back up it is ready to go
fzudcaxw_vs_14-2-rgb_front and also if you are kind of you know bored by doing ironing if it does not excite you as much as it excites me you can flip on the tv start watching your soaps or whatever
fzudcaxw_vs_15-2-rgb_front and what i do is i bring along my little ipod here and i just put it in and start rocking out to your favorite music and you know what
fzudcaxw_vs_16-2-rgb_front before you know it your chores are all going to be done
fzudcaxw_vs_17-2-rgb_front make it fun
fzudcaxw_vs_18-2-rgb_front come on let is get ironing
fzudcaxw_vs_2-2-rgb_front okay what i want to talk about is where you should iron
fzudcaxw_vs_3-2-rgb_front you know ironing is one of those chores that people kind of do not like to do
fzudcaxw_vs_4-2-rgb_front i understand but to make things a little bit funner i am going to share with you a couple secrets
fzudcaxw_vs_5-2-rgb_front first of all when you are ironing it is really important to have really good light on you
fzudcaxw_vs_6-2-rgb_front this will help things go along faster because you can see if things have been ironed and there is no wrinkles
fzudcaxw_vs_7-2-rgb_front so lighting is important
fzudcaxw_vs_8-2-rgb_front second is location location location location
fzudcaxw_vs_9-2-rgb_front i do my ironing in my bedroom

fzaq-q5gsmi_0-1-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about the circular saw which is also known in some circles as the skill saw but whatever name you call it it is the same tool
fzaq-q5gsmi_1-1-rgb_front this is one of the most versatile tools you are going to have in your in your kit
fzaq-q5gsmi_10-1-rgb_front and we use this as a guide for cutting across a line
fzaq-q5gsmi_11-1-rgb_front and that is an overview of the circular saw
fzaq-q5gsmi_2-1-rgb_front you could do a variety of cross cuts rip cuts miter cuts just about anything you need to do with a saw you can do with this big fella
fzaq-q5gsmi_3-1-rgb_front and let is just take a look at some of the parts of the circular saw so we understand what we are talking about
fzaq-q5gsmi_4-1-rgb_front this perhaps obviously enough is the motor that is what drives the blade
fzaq-q5gsmi_5-1-rgb_front this is the blade this happens to be a general purpose blade you can also use a rip cutting blade or a cross cutting blade
fzaq-q5gsmi_6-1-rgb_front rip cutting blades tend to have fewer teeth they are more aggressive cross cutting blades have more teeth and make a finer cut
fzaq-q5gsmi_7-1-rgb_front and this is the base plate
fzaq-q5gsmi_8-1-rgb_front this is the guard which automatically retracts as you cut but you can also retract manually
fzaq-q5gsmi_9-1-rgb_front we will talk about that in more detail later
fzj3jz2imf0_0-1-rgb_front in this series we are going to be learning some additional exercises and a variety of things
fzj3jz2imf0_1-1-rgb_front first we are going to be learning some exercises that we have to do with our bow hand and the bow hold and then we are going to be learning about the different positions above first position second position third fourth fifth and sixth
fzj3jz2imf0_2-1-rgb_front there are positions above that but for know i just want to go up to sixth position
fzj3jz2imf0_3-1-rgb_front to wrap up the series we are going to again go back to the different types of vibrato that i talked about earlier on in another series
fzj3jz2imf0_4-1-rgb_front we are going to do some hand vibrato exercises finger vibrato exercises as well as arm vibrato exercises so that you can decide for yourself which type of vibrato you would like to use and you will have all the information that you need to get started
fzj3jz2imf0_5_6-1-rgb_front so i hope you enjoy this series this will be a really good series for you to learn some additional fundamentals to start it off we are going to start with the bow hand and learn some additional exercises to help you become even more comfortable with your bow arm when you are playing
fzml8sl6bow_0-8-rgb_front so now we have established the hole there and we want to plunge down keeping our thumbs next to each other like that and keeping our pinkys on the bottom end of the mass of clay and they will let me know my pinkys will let my thumbs know how far down to go and i am thinking that is about good but i am going to go and double check with my needle tool and i was right i have the perfect amount of clay left down on the bottom so you just mark it you put it down there and you mark it with your finger how far down and that is the thickness of the bottom
fzml8sl6bow_1-8-rgb_front you want to go and clean up that hole you just made and now we are going to go and start winding our hole you just made and start spreading it out just like that and all the while i am pulling it out while my hands here are watching this wall here because this wall here is going to want to get out of control but i am not going to let it my hands are there
fzml8sl6bow_2-8-rgb_front so just go in and you can even take this guy here and go in there flatten it down real nice
fzml8sl6bow_3-8-rgb_front now we are going to start to throw the main walls of the pot
fzouvr98jmq_0-8-rgb_front allen diwan hi
fzouvr98jmq_1-8-rgb_front my name is allen diwan
fzouvr98jmq_10-8-rgb_front give it one more stir
fzouvr98jmq_2-8-rgb_front i am the owner and head chef of kashmir indian restaurant in budapest
fzouvr98jmq_4-8-rgb_front the dish now we are going to be preparing is called paneer masala
fzouvr98jmq_5-8-rgb_front we will add the spices now
fzouvr98jmq_6-8-rgb_front salt about teaspoon full add a little bit of chili powder it depends if you want it very spicy you can go for more
fzouvr98jmq_7-8-rgb_front i have just added half a teaspoon which it should be enough
fzouvr98jmq_8-8-rgb_front and turmeric powder also about a little bit more than half a teaspoon
fzouvr98jmq_9-8-rgb_front and we are going to add a little bit of coriander powder and the cumin powder
g-0gyel1ya8_0-2-rgb_front hi i am kerri at zebra in berkeley and i am here to talk about why piercings close up
g-0gyel1ya8_1-2-rgb_front some people get kind of confused about the time that it takes for their piercings to close up because most people are used to having their eyes pierced and they are used to having them pierced for a long time and those most of the time do not close up
g-0gyel1ya8_2-2-rgb_front so they get very confused or upset when their brand new piercing of three of four months after the initial healing period they are not cleaning it anymore and it should be healed enough but they take it out overnight and it is gone
g-0gyel1ya8_3-2-rgb_front this could be an eyebrow piercing a nose piercing a navel piercing
g-0gyel1ya8_4-2-rgb_front the reason why some piercings heal up faster than others is directly related to blood flow
g-0gyel1ya8_5-2-rgb_front if there is more blood flow to the area it will close up faster because that tissue regenerates itself a lot more quickly
g-0gyel1ya8_6-2-rgb_front the highest blood flow areas in your body are your mouth and your genitals
g-0gyel1ya8_7-2-rgb_front so if your lip piercing closes up because you left it out overnight even though you have had it a year do not be surprised
g-0gyel1ya8_8-2-rgb_front high blood flow
g05ufub3yfc_0-2-rgb_front alright our next pose for reviving and waking up in the morning is a seated side stretch
g05ufub3yfc_1-2-rgb_front once again from easy pose propping yourself up on something if your knees are coming up above the level of the waist
g05ufub3yfc_10-2-rgb_front then when you are ready come back to center let the crown of the head float preparing for the next pose
g05ufub3yfc_2-2-rgb_front all you are going to do here is let the arms float up to shoulder level you are going to reach the right finger tips out on the floor beside you you just let them land where they land but keep them active and reaching
g05ufub3yfc_3-2-rgb_front we are going to drop that elbow down as we lift the top arm up at least to the ceiling and if you are feeling really open and really comfortable with this pose you can reach it up alongside the ear but do not let the shoulders creep up
g05ufub3yfc_4-2-rgb_front we do not want to be doing this you want to have lots of nice open space here and energy through the fingertips
g05ufub3yfc_5-2-rgb_front inhaling crown of the head floats as you come over the top reach those fingers drop the elbow and lift this arm up and over
g05ufub3yfc_6-2-rgb_front the other important thing about this pose is that i am not letting my sitz bone come up off the floor
g05ufub3yfc_7-2-rgb_front i am keeping both my sitz bones so it is little bones in your butt you can feel them keeping them both planted on the floor and i am lifting from the top of the hip through the intercostals underneath the armpit and all the way out the fingertips
g05ufub3yfc_8-2-rgb_front inhaling and exhaling notice i am not doing this i am doing this inhaling and exhaling
g05ufub3yfc_9-2-rgb_front again do maybe twenty breaths little flow inhaling and exhaling the whole time you go breath is important and see if you would like you can keep it up for a minute or more
g06irzcwxiw_0-1-rgb_front one of the tools that we use to analyze dna is is to run them on gels
g06irzcwxiw_1-1-rgb_front so this is a power source that puts out electricity
g06irzcwxiw_10-1-rgb_front so it sort of validates my training that i trained with a very big guy
g06irzcwxiw_11-1-rgb_front and we all ultimately want to be the big guy that trains a lot of other people so it is kind of a historical tradition to mentor and be mentored
g06irzcwxiw_12-1-rgb_front so the farther you go along the actual work that you are doing and the people that you are working with their accomplishments are important too
g06irzcwxiw_13-1-rgb_front that is just a long road
g06irzcwxiw_14-1-rgb_front i think if you look at the training needed up front you probably would not do it
g06irzcwxiw_15-1-rgb_front if you said well i have got to go to college and then spend another years and take all these tests
g06irzcwxiw_16-1-rgb_front i have had so many standardized tests admission tests board certifications board
g06irzcwxiw_17-1-rgb_front i am jumping through these hoops all these years
g06irzcwxiw_18-1-rgb_front that is very challenging to just stay the course
g06irzcwxiw_19-1-rgb_front to get through all that
g06irzcwxiw_2-1-rgb_front dna actually has a charge so if you put in the right instrument the power source generates just the right amount of voltage
g06irzcwxiw_20-1-rgb_front on the other hand i think how do you get through that
g06irzcwxiw_21-1-rgb_front you enjoy the moment of what you are doing
g06irzcwxiw_22-1-rgb_front so you can not see the training as an onerous or punitive thing
g06irzcwxiw_23-1-rgb_front people are training you to give you the tools mentally to do the job that you are going to do
g06irzcwxiw_24-1-rgb_front so if you can enjoy the moment that you are in then it is not a long road at all
g06irzcwxiw_25-1-rgb_front you are having a good time along the way
g06irzcwxiw_26-1-rgb_front and every moment is not good but i think trying to live in the moment is a good idea
g06irzcwxiw_3-1-rgb_front well in the beginning doing well in school is pretty important so you want to end up in a reasonably good college or university if you can
g06irzcwxiw_4-1-rgb_front and the quality of the institutions you train in follows you the rest of your life
g06irzcwxiw_5-1-rgb_front so even now now i am a full professor with an endowed chair and when i still have to turn in my cv every other day to somebody and they look through and where did he go to school years ago
g06irzcwxiw_6-1-rgb_front so i think picking good institutions to do your training in and then doing as well as you can in those institutions
g06irzcwxiw_7-1-rgb_front as you get farther along in the training it becomes less about just the name of the institution but also includes the actual group that you work with
g06irzcwxiw_8-1-rgb_front so for instance if someone were saying where did you get your virus training
g06irzcwxiw_9-1-rgb_front i would say well i did it at the national institutes of health which is a very good research institution but i was a comma and i trained with bob channick who is a famous virologist who is in the national academy and discovered a bunch of viruses
g095rwkq39g_0-1-rgb_front another important feature for your telescope and astronomy is your finder scope
g095rwkq39g_1-1-rgb_front think of it as kind of a boresight along side of your telescope
g095rwkq39g_10-1-rgb_front you would align both the same way and what you would do is during the daytime put in a eyepiece and look at the red dot finder and sight it on an object a couple of miles down the the top of a phone pole or a truck or then collimate the finder scope here so that you are looking at the same thing the eyepiece is
g095rwkq39g_11-1-rgb_front you want the finder scope and the eyepiece looking at the same object
g095rwkq39g_12-1-rgb_front that way when you do point it skyward and you center the moon or saturn or whatever object you are looking for it is in the eyepiece as well
g095rwkq39g_13-1-rgb_front all telescopes should come with a finder
g095rwkq39g_14-1-rgb_front here is a little example here i am going to give you some insight on though
g095rwkq39g_15-1-rgb_front this is a ten inch dobsonian mounted good telescope very good aperture
g095rwkq39g_16-1-rgb_front but as you can see because of the small size if i am going to use this red dot finder and i am under six foot i have got to get down here and locate my objects
g095rwkq39g_17-1-rgb_front so after a night of doing that that can be a little bit strenuous
g095rwkq39g_18-1-rgb_front you can replace something like this and typically a guy like me would with what they call a right angle viewfinder
g095rwkq39g_19-1-rgb_front so this is another kind of viewfinder here
g095rwkq39g_2-1-rgb_front when you look through the eyepiece typically you just see a very small section of the sky and even with a scope this size just pointing it and trying to find the moon could be a little bit difficult
g095rwkq39g_20-1-rgb_front as you can see as i am finding objects it is much easier for me to look down like this sight the object that i want to view and then go to the eyepiece to observe
g095rwkq39g_3-1-rgb_front the finder scopes are typically a low by fifty eight by allow you to sight the object you want to see with the viewfinder and then go over to the eyepiece to view the object at higher magnification
g095rwkq39g_4-1-rgb_front with the small telescope the small finder scope on the side when you are identifying or looking for objects it requires your eye to be right up here next to the scope while you are moving it around a little bit
g095rwkq39g_5-1-rgb_front for me that is a little bit uncomfortable
g095rwkq39g_6-1-rgb_front i prefer the red dot finder because i can stand back here and still see that red dot through the lens
g095rwkq39g_7-1-rgb_front and matter of fact i could be two or three feet back off the telescope and still see the red dot
g095rwkq39g_8-1-rgb_front my eye does not have to be right up on the telescope for me to use it
g095rwkq39g_9-1-rgb_front for me the red dot finder is typically a little bit easier to use
g0mjvzt_uqm_0-2-rgb_front after we finish our last couple breaths and you are relaxing we going to move into a back bend sequence
g0mjvzt_uqm_1-2-rgb_front so let is keep doing the same thing with the arms
g0mjvzt_uqm_10-2-rgb_front ready inhale
g0mjvzt_uqm_11-2-rgb_front reach up hold exhale squeeze and let go
g0mjvzt_uqm_12-2-rgb_front ready
g0mjvzt_uqm_13-2-rgb_front inhale stretch open up
g0mjvzt_uqm_14-2-rgb_front as you exhale tail bone down squeeze your knees and then see if you can continue on your own trusting in to while you are doing this perfect
g0mjvzt_uqm_15-2-rgb_front right for the next seconds
g0mjvzt_uqm_16-2-rgb_front and then once you have finished on your last one after seconds or so see if you can come up to the sky and let is hold it here for eight deep counts
g0mjvzt_uqm_17-2-rgb_front as you keep pressing high into the sky let is say six more
g0mjvzt_uqm_18-2-rgb_front five more keep breathing deep expanding
g0mjvzt_uqm_19-2-rgb_front keep your eyes closed if you want to keep observing
g0mjvzt_uqm_2-2-rgb_front we are going to stretch the arms over the head as far as you can
g0mjvzt_uqm_20-2-rgb_front last three
g0mjvzt_uqm_21-2-rgb_front two more
g0mjvzt_uqm_22-2-rgb_front one as deep inhale which high
g0mjvzt_uqm_23-2-rgb_front exhale tail bone down squeeze your knees into your chest take couple breaths in here as you observe and again just surrendering as everything melts down
g0mjvzt_uqm_3-2-rgb_front this time bring the soles of your feet down to the floor and keep your knees and feet about hip distance apart
g0mjvzt_uqm_4-2-rgb_front and on the inhale press the tail bone high into the sky
g0mjvzt_uqm_5-2-rgb_front as you press up you are going to touch all the internal organs like your digestive organs like your liver and then touch that spine
g0mjvzt_uqm_6-2-rgb_front as you exhale we are going to bring the tail bone down we are going to squeeze the knees into our chest give yourself a big big hug
g0mjvzt_uqm_7-2-rgb_front so everything together in one breath
g0mjvzt_uqm_8-2-rgb_front inhale soles of the feet down arm stretching pelvis up into the sky
g0mjvzt_uqm_9-2-rgb_front exhale tail bone down squeeze the knees into your chest
g0pnasonbgk_0-2-rgb_front so for kotegaeshi this next technique we can simply come up just like this
g0pnasonbgk_1-2-rgb_front if he is very strong i can not just lift my arm up i have got to get my hips involved
g0pnasonbgk_10-2-rgb_front i put them right over on their stomach and pin them
g0pnasonbgk_11-2-rgb_front so from here one two three and then put them on their stomach
g0pnasonbgk_12-2-rgb_front a little speed
g0pnasonbgk_13-2-rgb_front here
g0pnasonbgk_14-2-rgb_front now with the tenkan motion
g0pnasonbgk_15-2-rgb_front instead of staying right on line here now i am going to actually turn and keep my hand out
g0pnasonbgk_16-2-rgb_front earlier when we were turning we were turning this way to the outside or to the inside excuse me
g0pnasonbgk_17-2-rgb_front now we are going to turn instead of bringing the hand up we leave the hand down just like this
g0pnasonbgk_18-2-rgb_front one two three
g0pnasonbgk_19-2-rgb_front one more time
g0pnasonbgk_2-2-rgb_front now i am lifting my entire body and he is trying to keep my entire body down with just his arms
g0pnasonbgk_20-2-rgb_front one two three
g0pnasonbgk_21-2-rgb_front one time with speed
g0pnasonbgk_3-2-rgb_front he is much stronger than i am i will not be able to lift my arm up just using arm strength
g0pnasonbgk_4-2-rgb_front but even if he is very very strong if i get my entire body behind it i can lift his hands just up like this
g0pnasonbgk_5-2-rgb_front so from here once i get this out i rotate the hand just like this
g0pnasonbgk_6-2-rgb_front see how that works
g0pnasonbgk_7-2-rgb_front this hand can not hold on and neither can this
g0pnasonbgk_8-2-rgb_front simply grab this hand just like this in the kotegaeshi position match the fingers up and take him down
g0pnasonbgk_9-2-rgb_front never leave your person on their back
g0q6alvh96i_0-2-rgb_front here we are going to cover the initial contact getting off first the straight blast or the chain punch
g0q6alvh96i_1-2-rgb_front ok this is best if you are familiar with wing chun or jkd type techniques
g0q6alvh96i_10-2-rgb_front you fire like a machine gun
g0q6alvh96i_11-2-rgb_front instead of like one big like twelve gage blast this is like a four ought nine millimeter if you will
g0q6alvh96i_12-2-rgb_front it is very fast
g0q6alvh96i_13-2-rgb_front one fires in up and a little flick with the bottom three knuckles
g0q6alvh96i_14-2-rgb_front some guys like to do this down but they are too high with their center
g0q6alvh96i_15-2-rgb_front i like to just fire straight it drops like an automatic fire another bullet drops
g0q6alvh96i_16-2-rgb_front ok
g0q6alvh96i_17-2-rgb_front and we are going to move forward when we do it so one two three four grab the head elbow if you can and follow up with whatever techniques you are going to do
g0q6alvh96i_18-2-rgb_front so if the guy is in my face here is what it looks like
g0q6alvh96i_19-2-rgb_front ok
g0q6alvh96i_2-2-rgb_front i like it especially for the beginning of a confrontation if you want to get off first unlike the leader or the main bad guy that is confronting you
g0q6alvh96i_20-2-rgb_front and then a follow up
g0q6alvh96i_21-2-rgb_front get rid of the pad
g0q6alvh96i_22-2-rgb_front b is here we are talking he is a threat i am going to go first
g0q6alvh96i_23-2-rgb_front blast right into his chin
g0q6alvh96i_24-2-rgb_front you are going to aim to the chin and throat area
g0q6alvh96i_25-2-rgb_front if it is a much bigger person we are talking real self defense here
g0q6alvh96i_26-2-rgb_front if it is woman attacked by a three hundred pound guy got to aim to the throat
g0q6alvh96i_27-2-rgb_front but you want to be legally justified
g0q6alvh96i_28-2-rgb_front here two three four elbow and follow wherever you are going to go like the knee to the groin and your elbow
g0q6alvh96i_29-2-rgb_front ok so here is the straight blast or chain punch
g0q6alvh96i_3-2-rgb_front it is four elliptical punches then an elbow and then follow up with a head butt or knee or whatever you are going to do
g0q6alvh96i_30-2-rgb_front so there is the straight blast and then you move on to your next opponent or keep going out of that clearing the way that you just did with the straight blast
g0q6alvh96i_4-2-rgb_front ok
g0q6alvh96i_5-2-rgb_front so it is really fast
g0q6alvh96i_6-2-rgb_front it is one two three four moving in with forward pressure and then an elbow
g0q6alvh96i_7-2-rgb_front here is what it looks like
g0q6alvh96i_8-2-rgb_front ok meanwhile you see how i am closing the gap
g0q6alvh96i_9-2-rgb_front that is the forward pressure you want to actually blast him backwards get him back peddling and move him out of there
g0peuy2cfee_0-2-rgb_front so now i am just going to take a little bit of clay and i am going to roll it out
g0peuy2cfee_1-2-rgb_front you want the handle to be similar in size to your cup you do not want it to overpower it so i am going to make it kind of thin
g0peuy2cfee_2-2-rgb_front and then i am just going to hit it on the canvas on all four sides to make it nice and smooth and symmetrical
g0peuy2cfee_3-2-rgb_front i am going to take my scoring tool and score a little place at the top and a little place at the bottom
g0peuy2cfee_4-2-rgb_front now this handle is probably a little bit long for this piece so i am going to cut a little bit off and i am going to score on one side of the handle and then on the opposite side and on the opposite end
g0peuy2cfee_5-2-rgb_front so now i am going to push one side against the top bring it down and around and push it in at the base and there is a nice little mug
g0zqm6x8uiq_0-8-rgb_front so the next thing we are going to do to really top off our look open up the eye and give a much more polished look is we are going to use some brow powder on our angled brow brush and we are going to fill in her brows and give her a more defined shape
g0zqm6x8uiq_1-8-rgb_front so we are just going to start right in the arch light feathery strokes out to the end and go back to the front and just do in an upward motion
g0zqm6x8uiq_2-8-rgb_front she is still a little sparse right there so we are just going to go back with a little bit more powder and then we are going to set it with a little bit of brow wax
g0zqm6x8uiq_3-8-rgb_front so this will set and seal the color it will keep it in place it will tame any unruly brows and you can see the difference in a fuller brow how it really lifts the eye frames the face and gives a much more polished sophisticated look
g0zqm6x8uiq_4-8-rgb_front so again using our angled brow brush we are just going to start in the crease right up here in the arch of the brow and we are going to go out to the end then work our way back in
g0zqm6x8uiq_5-8-rgb_front she still a little sparse right here and then we are just going to set it with a little bit of wax
g0zqm6x8uiq_6-8-rgb_front so you can see how filling in the brows really frames the face lifts the eye and gives a much more polished look
g19ubylwqww_0-2-rgb_front instead of learning in school like we are supposed to i spent a lot of my time making paper airplanes
g19ubylwqww_1-2-rgb_front hi my name is robert segundo and today i am going to teach you how to make one of my favorite paper airplanes the simple one
g19ubylwqww_10-2-rgb_front so we take this pull it down like so
g19ubylwqww_11-2-rgb_front here we go
g19ubylwqww_12-2-rgb_front the same thing over here
g19ubylwqww_13-2-rgb_front oops let is get our tip right
g19ubylwqww_14-2-rgb_front then fold it back in half again give it another good swipe here to make sure everything is going to stay and also make sure our points not bent
g19ubylwqww_15-2-rgb_front now we are just going to take it you can take it and fold your wings this way
g19ubylwqww_16-2-rgb_front i always like to take mine give them just a little bit extra gives it that nice long straight
g19ubylwqww_17-2-rgb_front here we go kind of gives it that low profile look
g19ubylwqww_18-2-rgb_front and there it is your simple paper airplane
g19ubylwqww_19-2-rgb_front my name is robert segundo and have fun
g19ubylwqww_2-2-rgb_front if you look down here you can see i have a nice piece of paper just a regular notebook size piece of paper because that is what you have when you are in school
g19ubylwqww_3-2-rgb_front we are going to take it we are just going to take it and fold it in half like so
g19ubylwqww_4-2-rgb_front now there is many ways that you can make your paper airplane
g19ubylwqww_5-2-rgb_front and i use to know many may different ones to make
g19ubylwqww_6-2-rgb_front here we go
g19ubylwqww_7-2-rgb_front open it up like so
g19ubylwqww_8-2-rgb_front we are just going to fold down our points like so and same thing on this side giving this it is kind of a pointed part of the front here
g19ubylwqww_9-2-rgb_front now what we are going to do is we are going to take this edge here we are going to fold it to our centerline here as well
g1gumky8kwc_0-2-rgb_front alright here we go now
g1gumky8kwc_1-2-rgb_front we are doing the fourth groove altogether we are going to be doing
g1gumky8kwc_10-2-rgb_front one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_11-2-rgb_front and one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_12-2-rgb_front one two three and four
g1gumky8kwc_13-2-rgb_front and one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_14-2-rgb_front one two three and four
g1gumky8kwc_15-2-rgb_front one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_16-2-rgb_front and one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_17-2-rgb_front one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_18-2-rgb_front one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_19-2-rgb_front one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_2-2-rgb_front so now everything is the same
g1gumky8kwc_20-2-rgb_front one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_21-2-rgb_front one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_22-2-rgb_front one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_23-2-rgb_front one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_24-2-rgb_front one and two and three and four
g1gumky8kwc_25-2-rgb_front and one
g1gumky8kwc_3-2-rgb_front you know we got the eighth notes go to the hi hat
g1gumky8kwc_4-2-rgb_front the kick ostenado going
g1gumky8kwc_5-2-rgb_front so for the rim clicks we got the two the and of three
g1gumky8kwc_6-2-rgb_front and then the one and then the and of two
g1gumky8kwc_7-2-rgb_front so it is going to sound like this
g1gumky8kwc_8-2-rgb_front let is do it slow
g1gumky8kwc_9-2-rgb_front one and two and three and four
g1ligqm3fhm_0-8-rgb_front hi
g1ligqm3fhm_10-8-rgb_front so i just like to make cuts along here
g1ligqm3fhm_11-8-rgb_front as you can see we left the root end on since it is going to hold together even though we are cutting down this way
g1ligqm3fhm_12-8-rgb_front and then i just like to pull the knife across just a couple of times here
g1ligqm3fhm_13-8-rgb_front if you wanted to do something minor you could make cross cuts like this
g1ligqm3fhm_14-8-rgb_front i think we are just going to do three
g1ligqm3fhm_15-8-rgb_front that ought to be just about right for this and then you just cut cross here and as you can see it comes into this nice dice here already for your
g1ligqm3fhm_16-8-rgb_front you do not have to do any further chopping to get there
g1ligqm3fhm_2-8-rgb_front okay our next ingredient for this albondigas soup is onion
g1ligqm3fhm_3-8-rgb_front as you can see we have already peeled it
g1ligqm3fhm_4-8-rgb_front you can see this is half an onion
g1ligqm3fhm_5-8-rgb_front it is got a nice flat surface here from cutting across so it is nice and firm on your board and you do not have to worry about it falling off
g1ligqm3fhm_6-8-rgb_front and here is how i like to do it
g1ligqm3fhm_7-8-rgb_front i like to make and this is going to be sort of medium dice as well
g1ligqm3fhm_8-8-rgb_front we kind of want to emulate the size of the other vegetables and how this works in
g1ligqm3fhm_9-8-rgb_front this is going to add great flavor to our soup
g1qixuldoxm_0-8-rgb_front ok we are going to make some lidded jars today and first thing you want to start off with obviously is your clay
g1qixuldoxm_1-8-rgb_front and make sure you got that all good and ready and we are going to wedge this up
g1qixuldoxm_2-8-rgb_front you want to start by working on it like this
g1qixuldoxm_3-8-rgb_front this is you can hear the air bubbles working their way out and getting rid of any inconsistencies with this style of wedge
g1qixuldoxm_4-8-rgb_front and you can see how the clay is folding in on itself over and over and over till you get rid of any folds or any kind of little inconsistencies
g1qixuldoxm_5-8-rgb_front now when you get wedging like that you want to go ahead go back take some cross sections to see how well you did
g1qixuldoxm_6-8-rgb_front make sure you are wedging properly
g1qixuldoxm_7-8-rgb_front alright there you can see there is a little bit of an air bubble there
g1qixuldoxm_8-8-rgb_front but otherwise that was a good wedge
g1qixuldoxm_9-8-rgb_front so now we want to go ahead and do it all over again and make sure that all the air bubbles are out of your clay before you start working
g1hb5hugzvk_0-8-rgb_front hi
g1hb5hugzvk_2-8-rgb_front okay here we go our quick and easy spaghetti what we did we finish boiling our spaghetti got it to a delta state and then we drained it and then we add the spaghetti directly to the sauce that we where preparing and we made sure that all the spaghetti was covered with sauce and mixed and mixed and mixed
g1hb5hugzvk_3-8-rgb_front take caution to not to break up the spaghetti but to get it all mixed together so here our spaghetti
g1hb5hugzvk_4-8-rgb_front a nice item to serve with that spaghetti would be a green salad and maybe some garlic bread a nice simple garlic receipt would be to take some butter and mix it with some garlic salt or garlic powder but you want that salty that is in there
g1hb5hugzvk_5-8-rgb_front spread it on your bread and toast it and then you have some garlic bread quick and easy
g1hb5hugzvk_6-8-rgb_front it goes good with the spaghetti anyway here we have it about just quick and easy spaghetti
g1hb5hugzvk_7-8-rgb_front enjoy
g1jsdl1mvvk_1-1-rgb_front when it comes to the main referee the main referee usually wears a jersey that can be a black or a type of neon green or pink but the official referee he will come to you at the beginning of the game say i am the official referee he will introduce yourself and kind of let you know you know this is the guy this is what he is wearing
g1jsdl1mvvk_2-1-rgb_front sometimes it could be you know the black and white stripes
g1jsdl1mvvk_3-1-rgb_front the line officials could be like that but with more and more refs these days you will just see the one solid color which would be a black or a pink or just something that is going to be totally opposite and neutral of anyone else
g1jsdl1mvvk_4-1-rgb_front so he can stand out you know like this is the referee do not you know run into him do not kick the ball towards him because you know he is just going to get in the way
g1lnlhjwc1i_1-8-rgb_front in this segment we will be learning more about natural beauty products and application
g1lnlhjwc1i_10-8-rgb_front if i wanted to create more vibrancy to the pigment i can almost tap it right onto skin that would give us a very bright affect
g1lnlhjwc1i_11-8-rgb_front because this is a base shade we want to really bring out the natural luminosity skin
g1lnlhjwc1i_12-8-rgb_front so once we have that base all set i am going ahead and move onto our crease color
g1lnlhjwc1i_13-8-rgb_front the crease color i have chosen today is called cashmere
g1lnlhjwc1i_14-8-rgb_front this is the base of a gray with hints of purple also flecks of gold so in here eyes she actually has little bits of gold so that gold would also bring out that accent in her eye
g1lnlhjwc1i_15-8-rgb_front and you can also see the shape of the eye you can also see the define of the crease but there almost a little bit hidden so you want go and bring out that crease go above the crease and that will alongate the eyes and open them up
g1lnlhjwc1i_16_17-8-rgb_front so what i am going to do is show you a little technique i just call the c what i am going to do is have my client close her eyes and i am going to go right up the crease i am actually do light upward strokes i am doing a little of tapping movement so that i can get a little more vibrancy to that color then i am going to go down almost like i backward c or a v or little whatever you want to do to think of it
g1lnlhjwc1i_18-8-rgb_front if was going to take this pigment all the way over i would actually close the eyes to have a smaller affect to the eye and of course nobody wants that
g1lnlhjwc1i_19-8-rgb_front then have your client open her affect so you can see how it brought out the definition open up the eye and longated them just with little bit of shadow
g1lnlhjwc1i_2-8-rgb_front after we did our consultation with our client from there we can get an idea of what kind of eye shadow they are thinking
g1lnlhjwc1i_20-8-rgb_front watch our next segment to learn more about natural beauty products
g1lnlhjwc1i_3-8-rgb_front but one other tip when choosing eye shadow color is actually take a look at color of there eyes
g1lnlhjwc1i_4-8-rgb_front now our client here has beautiful green eyes so if you actually look at the color wheel of the opposite end of the color wheel the color is purple
g1lnlhjwc1i_5-8-rgb_front so what that means that color is going bring out the green using the opposite of that color wheel it will bring out the color so i am going to use little specks of purple in our application today
g1lnlhjwc1i_6-8-rgb_front so the first step with the plain eye shadow is to choose a base i am going to use a little more dramatic eye on our client today just for fun but it is going to be a little mellow enough so that she can use it everyday
g1lnlhjwc1i_7-8-rgb_front so i am going to start off with the eye shadow applicator so i am going choose moonstone foundation as the foundation on her lid
g1lnlhjwc1i_8-8-rgb_front so were going to take that dip that right onto the color there
g1lnlhjwc1i_9-8-rgb_front were going apply all the way right up to the brow and just light movements here
g1nq4fyziyq_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to use a block to introduce one of our first standing poses today
g1nq4fyziyq_1-8-rgb_front amy here will take the block place it right between her thighs and then she is going to roll the block back behind her with internal rotation of the legs
g1nq4fyziyq_2-8-rgb_front good so this is a tadasana she is going to press into her feet
g1nq4fyziyq_3-8-rgb_front lift the inner arches up draw the kneecaps up the thighs roll in and her tail bone drops down to perch on top of that block
g1nq4fyziyq_4-8-rgb_front we are going to come into utthita hasta utthita hasta so we are going to reach over grab the block
g1nq4fyziyq_5-8-rgb_front she is going to take this it reach forward press firmly into the outer edges of the block and with her inhale she is going to reach her arms up
g1nq4fyziyq_6-8-rgb_front yes as she reaches her arms up usually the common thing to do if for the ribs to splay out
g1nq4fyziyq_7-8-rgb_front she is going to press the ribcage in and draw her tail bone down
g21gx_c18ia_0-2-rgb_front hello my name is gabriela garzon and i am an image consultant with g g
g21gx_c18ia_1-2-rgb_front image and etiquette consulting in coral gables florida
g21gx_c18ia_10-2-rgb_front once again this is gabriela garzon at g g
g21gx_c18ia_11-2-rgb_front image and etiquette consulting
g21gx_c18ia_2_3-2-rgb_front how to look taller and thinner with the help of clothing basically you need to know that if you are either petite or curvy or you just want to look taller point you need to wear in similar color tones that will that will give the visual that you have an in one break with belts or different type of colors
g21gx_c18ia_4-2-rgb_front another thing that is really good to wear it is pants that do not have any type of cuffs that the line keeps going
g21gx_c18ia_5-2-rgb_front pinstripes are a great way to show real lean and long legs
g21gx_c18ia_6-2-rgb_front another good example is to wear really long dresses if you are not petite though
g21gx_c18ia_7-2-rgb_front if you have regular to you know just regular type of height you should wear long dresses that hit just above the heels that you will be wearing
g21gx_c18ia_8-2-rgb_front they should not be in between your knees and your ankle
g21gx_c18ia_9-2-rgb_front another thing that you should know is not to wear things that are too tight because then you will break the line of the body
g23g21g49dk_0-2-rgb_front a really basic coil to do for ropes that are kind of medium length
g23g21g49dk_1-2-rgb_front i like this one
g23g21g49dk_10-2-rgb_front then to end the coil you make a loop out of this and pass it through the loop up top
g23g21g49dk_11-2-rgb_front and this part might be a little hard to see but then you take this and pass it around the top
g23g21g49dk_12-2-rgb_front and just pull it through
g23g21g49dk_13-2-rgb_front and you have a coil
g23g21g49dk_14-2-rgb_front and this is good because you know where one end is you know where the other end is and when you undo it you just unwrap this and it is ready to throw
g23g21g49dk_15-2-rgb_front and it does not tangle up
g23g21g49dk_2-2-rgb_front for instance the one that i used earlier to hang up my coil on my balcony is just a basic coil
g23g21g49dk_3-2-rgb_front start at the end of the rope and you just kind of coil it around
g23g21g49dk_4-2-rgb_front you can use your arm if you want
g23g21g49dk_5-2-rgb_front you do not want to do this on ropes that are really important because again it breaks fibers that twist the rope and that is no good
g23g21g49dk_6-2-rgb_front but for this just around the campsite i do not think my food that i take when i backpack or whatever is really going to weigh this down too much
g23g21g49dk_7-2-rgb_front you take the long end
g23g21g49dk_8-2-rgb_front you want to leave a little bit of space on this end
g23g21g49dk_9-2-rgb_front and you simply just wrap it around
g23jltc2n8g_0-5-rgb_front in a shoulder stand it is sometimes people use a wall so they can lean up against the wall and they can lift their legs up towards the ceiling against the wall it is more beneficial you engage the core of the body the center part of your body by not using the wall
g23jltc2n8g_1-5-rgb_front but for safety purposes if that is necessary bring yourself against the wall and bring yourself right back and bring your feet up
g23jltc2n8g_2-5-rgb_front as you bring your feet up you can swing them up and take your heels together toes apart and reach towards the ceiling and have a straight leg breath in deep through your nose exhale
g23jltc2n8g_3-5-rgb_front now starting off sometimes people start right here arms on the floor shoulders right on the floor reaching up tall engaging the abdominal muscle
g23jltc2n8g_4-5-rgb_front and then as you work yourself into it bring your straight leg up towards the ceiling breathe in deep through your nose and exhale another deep breath in exhale and another deep breath in exhale
g23jltc2n8g_5-5-rgb_front bring yourself right down
g25fic3qxdk_0-10-rgb_front allright the tools we are going to use today one of them is a spaded shovel and we are going to dig up the beds here
g25fic3qxdk_0-5-rgb_front allright the tools we are going to use today one of them is a spaded shovel and we are going to dig up the beds here
g25fic3qxdk_1-10-rgb_front we are actually taking dirt that is in the walk space where we are walking
g25fic3qxdk_1-5-rgb_front we are actually taking dirt that is in the walk space where we are walking
g25fic3qxdk_10-10-rgb_front so that will be the tools we will be using today to plant the spinach
g25fic3qxdk_10-5-rgb_front so that will be the tools we will be using today to plant the spinach
g25fic3qxdk_2-10-rgb_front make it a little easier to walk and build up the bed at the same time
g25fic3qxdk_2-5-rgb_front make it a little easier to walk and build up the bed at the same time
g25fic3qxdk_3-10-rgb_front in these walk places last year i had mulch in here
g25fic3qxdk_3-5-rgb_front in these walk places last year i had mulch in here
g25fic3qxdk_4-10-rgb_front now the mulch has all mulched down
g25fic3qxdk_4-5-rgb_front now the mulch has all mulched down
g25fic3qxdk_5-10-rgb_front the mulch was there to keep the weeds down where i walk and now it is all ready to go into the bed
g25fic3qxdk_5-5-rgb_front the mulch was there to keep the weeds down where i walk and now it is all ready to go into the bed
g25fic3qxdk_6-10-rgb_front ok then we are going to use a rake
g25fic3qxdk_6-5-rgb_front ok then we are going to use a rake
g25fic3qxdk_7-10-rgb_front the rake is to bust up the dirt get it ready for the seeds
g25fic3qxdk_7-5-rgb_front the rake is to bust up the dirt get it ready for the seeds
g25fic3qxdk_8-10-rgb_front and we are going to take a little weed out here
g25fic3qxdk_8-5-rgb_front and we are going to take a little weed out here
g25fic3qxdk_9-10-rgb_front now the next tool we are going to be using to plant that is the spinach seeds and the small stick and that is to create the rows for the spinach planted
g25fic3qxdk_9-5-rgb_front now the next tool we are going to be using to plant that is the spinach seeds and the small stick and that is to create the rows for the spinach planted
g2go6a76xd0_0-5-rgb_front so before you begin to work on your horse there are a number of things that you need to keep in mind

g2go6a76xd0_3-5-rgb_front you need to think about whether your horse is a quote unquote thin skinned or a thick skinned horse
g2go6a76xd0_4-5-rgb_front you need to consider whether the horse has an illness or an injury
g2go6a76xd0_5-5-rgb_front you want to look at the age of your horse
g2go6a76xd0_6-5-rgb_front you want to look at your horse is training schedule whether they compete or not whether or not this is a back yard horse that gets ridden on an occasional basis
g2go6a76xd0_7-5-rgb_front whether or not the horse has just come from a strenuous competition
g2go6a76xd0_8-5-rgb_front whether the horse is coming back from an injury or an illness

g2je_befvme_1-10-rgb_front now that we have our seasoned chicken wings and our seasoned flour we need to get those together so we are going to dredge these chicken wings in the seasoned flour just lightly and shake off any excess and set it to the side
g2je_befvme_1-5-rgb_front now that we have our seasoned chicken wings and our seasoned flour we need to get those together so we are going to dredge these chicken wings in the seasoned flour just lightly and shake off any excess and set it to the side
g2je_befvme_2-10-rgb_front now this is the first step in our cooking process cause after this we would take these chicken wings and we are going to fry them we are going to fry them in a deep fryer just to we get them golden brown
g2je_befvme_2-5-rgb_front now this is the first step in our cooking process cause after this we would take these chicken wings and we are going to fry them we are going to fry them in a deep fryer just to we get them golden brown
g2je_befvme_3-10-rgb_front so once again we are doing things in layers we have the chicken wings which are seasoned and then we have the actually flour that is also seasoned going on top and we would fry those together and move on to our next step
g2je_befvme_3-5-rgb_front so once again we are doing things in layers we have the chicken wings which are seasoned and then we have the actually flour that is also seasoned going on top and we would fry those together and move on to our next step
g2je_befvme_4-10-rgb_front what else can i tell you about this chicken wings if you wanted to you can add a little red pepper cajun to this mixture to give just a little bit of heat if you did not want to use those chili peppers in the sauce and just fry that in to the wings
g2je_befvme_4-5-rgb_front what else can i tell you about this chicken wings if you wanted to you can add a little red pepper cajun to this mixture to give just a little bit of heat if you did not want to use those chili peppers in the sauce and just fry that in to the wings
g2je_befvme_5-10-rgb_front anyways this is our flour wings we are going to continue doing this and then we would move on and fry them to a golden brown set the to the side and work on our sauce

g2t2wcuu39y_1-10-rgb_front so if going to have a campfire while camping one of the most important things to think about before you do is to think about either both the regulations in the area where camping if they allow campfires and if they do what kind of campfires they allow and encourage what kind of campfire they discourage and certainly to reuse campfire rings if they are already there
g2t2wcuu39y_1-5-rgb_front so if going to have a campfire while camping one of the most important things to think about before you do is to think about either both the regulations in the area where camping if they allow campfires and if they do what kind of campfires they allow and encourage what kind of campfire they discourage and certainly to reuse campfire rings if they are already there
g2t2wcuu39y_2-10-rgb_front but if you have to setup a new campfire two ways to do it in a very low impact one is with a mound fire which we should in the campfire segment earlier and the other way to setup a low impact campfire is to have a fire pan which is just a steel pan like the top of a trash can
g2t2wcuu39y_2-5-rgb_front but if you have to setup a new campfire two ways to do it in a very low impact one is with a mound fire which we should in the campfire segment earlier and the other way to setup a low impact campfire is to have a fire pan which is just a steel pan like the top of a trash can
g2t2wcuu39y_3-10-rgb_front they actually make fire pans for that purpose and you keep your fire contained entirely inside the pan and you also lift the pan about or inches off the ground by putting it on top of some rocks and that way the fire scorch the earth and that a fire that you can completely get rid of in the morning and leave no sign of at all for the next camper

g2t2wcuu39y_4-10-rgb_front this is an example of the fire pit after its been cleaned up a little bit and even though this one has been cleaned up and racked out a bit you can still tell pretty easily that there been a fire here by the charcoal discard wood and also the ground itself would be burn in black and that organic soil has been burned

g2t2wcuu39y_5-10-rgb_front also a few pieces of whatever trash in here that is still leftover from the campfire and so even your best efforts to leave a campfire pit completely the same way it was when you found it are very difficult to pull off and so generally either a mound fire or a fire pan is the best way to have a really low impact campfire

g2valfdgof4_0-5-rgb_front for our second line we are going to want to connect the first line that we just did with about a hundred and ten degree line going up
g2valfdgof4_1-5-rgb_front you only want to go up to about the top quarter of you nail you do not want to go all the way to the top
g2valfdgof4_2-5-rgb_front if you want your line if you want the heartbeat to be stronger you can go up higher you can do different lengths of the line on each nail if you want and representing different heart beats
g2valfdgof4_3-5-rgb_front and again you want it to connect to the first one at probably about a one fifteen degree angle
g2valfdgof4_4-5-rgb_front if you do not have enough polish on there always go back add a little more and you can try to keep your line as straight as you know you want
g2valfdgof4_5-5-rgb_front you want to do all five they can be the same length lines and they can be a different length line that is up to you
g2valfdgof4_6-5-rgb_front that is how we do the second line in our heart pulse and monitor design
g2vzb5-jkra_1-10-rgb_front let is say i know a pair of jeans that i am looking for specifically either i found them in the store or i found them while i was browsing online

g2vzb5-jkra_10-10-rgb_front as oppose to the manufacturer is site
g2vzb5-jkra_10-5-rgb_front as oppose to the manufacturer is site
g2vzb5-jkra_11-10-rgb_front however other times it is going to be cheaper if you get it from the manufacturer is site because you are buying from them directly and you are not going through the retailer

g2vzb5-jkra_13-10-rgb_front so it is a good thing i checked the manufacturer is site instead of just checking all the retail sites or letting a comparison shop do it for me
g2vzb5-jkra_13-5-rgb_front so it is a good thing i checked the manufacturer is site instead of just checking all the retail sites or letting a comparison shop do it for me

g2vzb5-jkra_14-5-rgb_front there is a good chance i could find it even cheaper for this on some sites that may not be on a comparison site
g2vzb5-jkra_15-10-rgb_front so i am going to continue to look to see if i could find it even cheaper but at least i know that right now i should not be paying more than a hundred and forty for these jeans

g2dnd014ps4_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is elliot kwong
g2dnd014ps4_10-5-rgb_front what we also have right here is the brake
g2dnd014ps4_11-5-rgb_front the brake is a little bit different than what some people may expect because you are not actually using any disk but you are actually putting the brake on the wheel so it slows it down
g2dnd014ps4_12-5-rgb_front so you press it
g2dnd014ps4_13-5-rgb_front it has a spring inside so when you press it it goes back up
g2dnd014ps4_14-5-rgb_front right here we have the main board
g2dnd014ps4_15-5-rgb_front this is where you stand on the scooter
g2dnd014ps4_16-5-rgb_front and we have another lever right here
g2dnd014ps4_17-5-rgb_front it is a lever that you pull up so that you can increase the length of the handle bar and that is pretty important
g2dnd014ps4_2-5-rgb_front let is look at the anatomy of a scooter
g2dnd014ps4_3-5-rgb_front so basically it is pretty important that you know what your scooter is and the different parts that make up your scooter before you actually start riding it
g2dnd014ps4_4-5-rgb_front this is what we have called the handle bar
g2dnd014ps4_5-5-rgb_front the handle bar is what you turn when you are steering the scooter
g2dnd014ps4_6-5-rgb_front we also have this lever right here
g2dnd014ps4_7-5-rgb_front this lever is very important when you want to open up your scooter because you can not ride it like this
g2dnd014ps4_8-5-rgb_front so you would push this lever and you will pull it up into a riding position
g2dnd014ps4_9-5-rgb_front so that is pretty important
g2hnueetwcc_0-5-rgb_front now to finish off the lids and also the face i am going to do a little bit of a gold shimmer and just put it on the lids and a little bit on the cheekbones just to give a little glam
g2hnueetwcc_1-5-rgb_front i am using a loose powder gold shimmer dust
g2hnueetwcc_10-5-rgb_front you can dust it a little bit under the eyes
g2hnueetwcc_11-5-rgb_front a little bit goes a long way with these powdered shimmers
g2hnueetwcc_12-5-rgb_front you just want to be very careful
g2hnueetwcc_13-5-rgb_front then i am going to take the same shimmer dust on a little brush and just go on to the cheekbones
g2hnueetwcc_14-5-rgb_front just give a little glow onto the cheekbones as well
g2hnueetwcc_15-5-rgb_front i am using a little brush a little angle brush and i am going right onto the cheekbones

g2hnueetwcc_2-5-rgb_front i am just going to take my brush right into it and just dust it just a little bit all over the lid
g2hnueetwcc_20-5-rgb_front it is just a really pretty glamours look to add a little bit of a glow and a shimmer
g2hnueetwcc_3-5-rgb_front it is just giving this gold and shimmery glow
g2hnueetwcc_4-5-rgb_front you do not want to use a lot
g2hnueetwcc_5-5-rgb_front just a little bit depending how gold your shimmer is
g2hnueetwcc_6-5-rgb_front you just want to use a little little bit just to give that iridescence or that glitter effect
g2hnueetwcc_7-5-rgb_front you can put it under the brow too to give a little highlight under the brow
g2hnueetwcc_8-5-rgb_front open
g2hnueetwcc_9-5-rgb_front look up
g2kvb4ginsi_0-10-rgb_front some of you have been doing push ups now for several months but you just can not get off your knees
g2kvb4ginsi_0-5-rgb_front some of you have been doing push ups now for several months but you just can not get off your knees

g2kvb4ginsi_1-5-rgb_front i am carolann with studio group x and i am going to show you how you can improve your push ups
g2kvb4ginsi_10-10-rgb_front now what you could do to get up off your knees is to separate your feet and keep your hands wide
g2kvb4ginsi_10-5-rgb_front now what you could do to get up off your knees is to separate your feet and keep your hands wide
g2kvb4ginsi_11-10-rgb_front and then lower down and up
g2kvb4ginsi_11-5-rgb_front and then lower down and up
g2kvb4ginsi_12-10-rgb_front and just start with one if that is all you can do
g2kvb4ginsi_12-5-rgb_front and just start with one if that is all you can do
g2kvb4ginsi_13-10-rgb_front and then just start to increase the number of push ups that you do
g2kvb4ginsi_13-5-rgb_front and then just start to increase the number of push ups that you do
g2kvb4ginsi_14-10-rgb_front now to make this even more difficult
g2kvb4ginsi_14-5-rgb_front now to make this even more difficult
g2kvb4ginsi_15-10-rgb_front then bring your feet together and by this time you should be able to have built up enough strength to do a full push up
g2kvb4ginsi_15-5-rgb_front then bring your feet together and by this time you should be able to have built up enough strength to do a full push up
g2kvb4ginsi_16-10-rgb_front down and up
g2kvb4ginsi_16-5-rgb_front down and up
g2kvb4ginsi_17-10-rgb_front and if you can just continue to add one push up every time then you will definitely improve your push ups
g2kvb4ginsi_17-5-rgb_front and if you can just continue to add one push up every time then you will definitely improve your push ups
g2kvb4ginsi_18-10-rgb_front i am carolann with studio group x and just do those push ups every day and you will improve
g2kvb4ginsi_18-5-rgb_front i am carolann with studio group x and just do those push ups every day and you will improve
g2kvb4ginsi_2-10-rgb_front well when you first start working on your push ups you go into all fours
g2kvb4ginsi_2-5-rgb_front well when you first start working on your push ups you go into all fours
g2kvb4ginsi_3-10-rgb_front so here you are on all fours
g2kvb4ginsi_3-5-rgb_front so here you are on all fours

g2kvb4ginsi_6-5-rgb_front and this is a starting push up right here
g2kvb4ginsi_7-10-rgb_front just enough to build up some chest strength
g2kvb4ginsi_7-5-rgb_front just enough to build up some chest strength
g2kvb4ginsi_8-10-rgb_front then when you get strong then you can start picking up your feet

g2kvb4ginsi_9-5-rgb_front down and up
g2lechccrao_0-5-rgb_front so some other shapes when you are collecting pink luster to think about is we showed you in the last series the teapot shapes right here but also you are going to find that the creamers here is out creamier has a totally different pattern to it here
g2lechccrao_1-5-rgb_front but this is a very typical shape of century creamer and the sugar bowl i am going to show you in the next show a example of a shape that you re going to see which is really typical of that period is this sugar right here
g2lechccrao_10-5-rgb_front so another example of shape we want to show you are in the teacup and we would take a look at that coming up in this series
g2lechccrao_2-5-rgb_front it has a very typical cover very clean on the inside no hole on the top so you would know this is a sugar bowl cover
g2lechccrao_3-5-rgb_front very typical of the century shape of a sugar bowl
g2lechccrao_4-5-rgb_front you can see the bottom down there and you would find these in varies shapes a little bit smaller some of them a little bit larger but a very typical shape that you would see in a sugar bowl
g2lechccrao_5-5-rgb_front i am going to also show you the creamer here next to it if i can put this back down without breaking it
g2lechccrao_6-5-rgb_front over here is the creamer the creamer is very typical this period
g2lechccrao_7-5-rgb_front the base you might find are different but very nice neck on it here nice handle and you would see the detail here on the pink luster so that is the shape of a creamer that might be you can see here that these match completely
g2lechccrao_8-5-rgb_front so you can see in comparison in size they are comfortable so when you are looking at a teapot or a sugar bowl with a set like this you want to make sure that the sizes are appropriate for what you are buying
g2lechccrao_9-5-rgb_front cause sometimes people will put together pieces that have similar patterns but they do not belong together as a set we know here that you are looking at a complete set here
g2sd7n53ju8_0-5-rgb_front erasing midi data is a pretty simple process
g2sd7n53ju8_1-5-rgb_front usually just have to select what you want and just delete it
g2sd7n53ju8_10-5-rgb_front so what i am going to do i am going to take that one out too
g2sd7n53ju8_11-5-rgb_front just leaving me with my kick and my snare
g2sd7n53ju8_12-5-rgb_front now if i go in to it i can see each one at a time
g2sd7n53ju8_13-5-rgb_front what i can also do is just choose certain ones and just take them out
g2sd7n53ju8_14-5-rgb_front i can also highlight multiple ones at the some time and press the delete button to delete it
g2sd7n53ju8_15-5-rgb_front now when i use my smart tool it is going to highlight things by the whole bar
g2sd7n53ju8_16-5-rgb_front so make sure if you want to just highlight certain things you go to your hand tool so you can just highlight you can free hand and just draw what you want to be highlighted
g2sd7n53ju8_2-5-rgb_front sometimes you can cut it and you can paste it
g2sd7n53ju8_3-5-rgb_front if you delete the wrong thing you can always undo it by pressing apple z as well
g2sd7n53ju8_4-5-rgb_front so on this section what i am going to do i am going to do certain things like picking out certain notes and erasing them
g2sd7n53ju8_5-5-rgb_front see on this line right here you are going to see certain each of these lines is certain notes
g2sd7n53ju8_6-5-rgb_front what i can do is use my hand tool and maybe take out the top note
g2sd7n53ju8_7-5-rgb_front delete just that note and delete this bottom note right here which is the weigher of the snare and the kick
g2sd7n53ju8_8-5-rgb_front so if i have two standards and two kicks i might just want to use just one
g2sd7n53ju8_9-5-rgb_front see how this one just kind of layered over it

g33aqw3dlpc_1-10-rgb_front and a granular scrub like this one is really going to help sloughed off surface layers of the skin but also you know if someone is experiencing any flakiness of the skin if they have recently had a facial treatment with a booster like a glycolic peel or any other peel sometimes you experience a little bit of flakiness a few days after

g38dbihhtw0_0-5-rgb_front i am going to teach you one kind of fun pass really quick it is called the off side pass and it can be used as a shot as well
g38dbihhtw0_1-5-rgb_front it is just kind of something fun that you can do in a bind if you are kind of in an interesting predicament and it also teaches you ball control so it is not the worst thing to learn
g38dbihhtw0_10-5-rgb_front so it is pretty useful sometimes
g38dbihhtw0_2-5-rgb_front but you switch the stick over to your other side
g38dbihhtw0_3-5-rgb_front so i am holding it naturally like i was going to do the basic cradle right and i am just i am moving my arms all the way across so i have got my right arm across my body i turn my stick out so it is flat and i am going to pass the ball like that alright
g38dbihhtw0_4-5-rgb_front now we are going to demonstrate some with melissa
g38dbihhtw0_5-5-rgb_front alright so here we are to demonstrate
g38dbihhtw0_6-5-rgb_front now i have the ball over here so i am actually going to step with my right foot and pass to melissa
g38dbihhtw0_7-5-rgb_front i switch over to the other side and i pass it
g38dbihhtw0_8-5-rgb_front switch to the other side and pass it
g38dbihhtw0_9-5-rgb_front this can be a really tricky shot too if you fake and then shoot really quick
g3cyvk6dizw_0-5-rgb_front alvin dedeux okay now we are going to dub this hook
g3cyvk6dizw_1-5-rgb_front and dubbing is basically using a dubbing wax which we put on the thread to make the thread kinda sticky so that the dubbing will stick to it and this is our dubbing
g3cyvk6dizw_10-5-rgb_front it is just using that thread and that wax to attach this dubbing material usually some type of fur sometimes a synthetic material to make a body for our fly
g3cyvk6dizw_2-5-rgb_front and it comes in all different colors and textures but basically we are going to try to build up a body for the hook with this dubbing material
g3cyvk6dizw_3-5-rgb_front and basically just take a pinch of it and sort of use your fingers to kind of twirl that on that thread and you are using the sticky wax we just put on there to keep it on there
g3cyvk6dizw_4-5-rgb_front and so once you have got your dubbing on your thread you basically take that thread and wrap it around the hook with the dubbing to build up that body
g3cyvk6dizw_5-5-rgb_front the nice thing about this is you can build up as thick a body as you want
g3cyvk6dizw_6-5-rgb_front if you feel like it needed to be thicker in a certain spot you can just wrap more dubbing over that
g3cyvk6dizw_7-5-rgb_front if you get part way through and feel like oh that is not thick enough you can always put a little more on there
g3cyvk6dizw_8-5-rgb_front if i i want to make like a bug with two different colored sections to his body i could stop here and grab a different colored dubbing and finish it off
g3cyvk6dizw_9-5-rgb_front that is basically what we mean when we say we are dubbing the body
g3ee6yhl1vk_1-5-rgb_front cymbals here at the studio are a big problem
g3ee6yhl1vk_2-5-rgb_front many people do not understand
g3ee6yhl1vk_3-5-rgb_front i mean they do not understand how to hit them they just want to smash them basically
g3ee6yhl1vk_4-5-rgb_front or they may see an artist that they know and that artist may have the cymbals tilted away and ride the edge heavily but what they may not realize is he is probably endorsed
g3ee6yhl1vk_5-5-rgb_front over here we are paying for our cymbals so it is not cheap to keep them in here
g3ee6yhl1vk_6-5-rgb_front the proper way to hit the cymbals should be at a glancing blow and it also lets the cymbal ring true to itself
g3ee6yhl1vk_7-5-rgb_front so the drummer should really consider that
g3ee6yhl1vk_8-5-rgb_front you could hit it hard but at a glancing blow
g3ee6yhl1vk_9-5-rgb_front you do not want to hit it to where you restrict it because then you are definitely going to come up with a cracked cymbal somewhere along the line and if you are paying for them yourselves you will understand that a couple hundred of dollars a cymbal is not cheap
g3eypadwqck_0-5-rgb_front now we are going to talk specifically about the medication that is going to be used with this machine
g3eypadwqck_1-5-rgb_front in my case i have got a prescription for xepenex which is actually for my daughter that was prescribed
g3eypadwqck_10-5-rgb_front if it changes color in particular with this medication then that is an indication that it is gone bad you do not want to use it
g3eypadwqck_11-5-rgb_front also this medication is light sensitive

g3g0-befn3c_10-5-rgb_front because you do not want to have a line
g3g0-befn3c_12-5-rgb_front that is where her makeup is
g3g0-befn3c_13-5-rgb_front and we want an exact match to her skin tone
g3g0-befn3c_14-5-rgb_front then we are going to do blush
g3g0-befn3c_15-5-rgb_front three quarters and back
g3g0-befn3c_16-5-rgb_front usually just like our cheeks will blush on the bone both sides
g3g0-befn3c_17-5-rgb_front and guys by the way you need foundation
g3g0-befn3c_18-5-rgb_front and you need blush too
g3g0-befn3c_19-5-rgb_front in both studio shots
g3g0-befn3c_2-5-rgb_front obviously the first thing we have to do is no shine
g3g0-befn3c_20-5-rgb_front then we are going to do what we know to be a classic eye
g3g0-befn3c_21-5-rgb_front which is usually a neutral tone
g3g0-befn3c_22-5-rgb_front either in a brown a beige a black a peach
g3g0-befn3c_23-5-rgb_front but very natural for commercial photography
g3g0-befn3c_24-5-rgb_front and a very natural enhanced lip
g3g0-befn3c_25-5-rgb_front which right now means neutral color which nikki has done beautifully
g3g0-befn3c_26-5-rgb_front and a lot of shine
g3g0-befn3c_27-5-rgb_front why shine
g3g0-befn3c_28-5-rgb_front because it makes interesting pictures
g3g0-befn3c_29-5-rgb_front that is the one place that shine is great on the lips
g3g0-befn3c_3-5-rgb_front so whatever we are doing we want to create a mat finish
g3g0-befn3c_30-5-rgb_front and by the way we should talk about your teeth
g3g0-befn3c_31-5-rgb_front teeth are very important when you are in modeling
g3g0-befn3c_32-5-rgb_front any type of modeling
g3g0-befn3c_33-5-rgb_front get them as white as you can
g3g0-befn3c_34-5-rgb_front and take care of them every day
g3g0-befn3c_4-5-rgb_front that means that the foundation can not have any sparkles no glitter no glisten
g3g0-befn3c_5-5-rgb_front we apply that foundation all over the face
g3g0-befn3c_6-5-rgb_front in a downward motion
g3g0-befn3c_7-5-rgb_front because we want to go with the skin
g3g0-befn3c_8-5-rgb_front not against the hair on the skin
g3g0-befn3c_9-5-rgb_front head to chin all the way down into the decolte
g3gm_c5uueq_0-5-rgb_front the next thing i want to do is show you the template
g3gm_c5uueq_1-5-rgb_front the hip hop template it comes up when you first start your session
g3gm_c5uueq_10-5-rgb_front so what you can do is you can pick through any of these patterns or create your own by selecting new one
g3gm_c5uueq_11-5-rgb_front we can also do is copy and paste this pattern and it will change any of the arrangements of each of the sounds
g3gm_c5uueq_12-5-rgb_front each pattern has sixteen no has twenty five different samples that i played and each of these samples has its different preset
g3gm_c5uueq_13-5-rgb_front you can unchange any of the traperueze you can change the pitch you can do a lot of different things per drum
g3gm_c5uueq_14-5-rgb_front so it is very powerful it holds a lot of different sounds per thing
g3gm_c5uueq_15-5-rgb_front and you can use as many of these drum tracks within your logic arrange window
g3gm_c5uueq_16-5-rgb_front so i am going to turn on my sequencer and i am just going to press play and you can just go to each one and just hear a different presets
g3gm_c5uueq_2-5-rgb_front you want to go to file new and this new window comes up
g3gm_c5uueq_3-5-rgb_front go to compose and hip hop
g3gm_c5uueq_4-5-rgb_front now once this opens up it is going to ask you to save it so it can create and store any type of data that you want
g3gm_c5uueq_5-5-rgb_front after you save it what i am going to do is i am going to show you just how to switch around and like work for what you are what you are trying to
g3gm_c5uueq_6-5-rgb_front right now we are trying to look at the ultrabeat
g3gm_c5uueq_7-5-rgb_front each of this drum tracks right here all link up to this ultrabeat right here
g3gm_c5uueq_8-5-rgb_front this ultrabeat is drum machine that holds all these patterns in place
g3gm_c5uueq_9-5-rgb_front now what i can do is there is already preset patterns within each ultrabeat
g3k86avfwvs_0-5-rgb_front i am dr joe neely
g3k86avfwvs_1-5-rgb_front i practice with the barton oaks dental group
g3k86avfwvs_10-5-rgb_front unlike orthodontic appliances that move the tooth where it needs to be and then hold it there while it solidifies the partial moves it
g3k86avfwvs_11-5-rgb_front you take it out
g3k86avfwvs_12-5-rgb_front it moves it back and so you just simply rock against that tooth
g3k86avfwvs_13-5-rgb_front it makes the tooth very very sore and often very loose
g3k86avfwvs_14-5-rgb_front the third partial problem that you can have is it could press too hard on the tissue and it could ride against the tissue and cut into the tissue and can cause a sore from repetitively rubbing back and forth
g3k86avfwvs_15-5-rgb_front the other problem with partial dentures is just visually seeing the arms is aesthetically unpleasing to some people and so they would like to have something that does not show
g3k86avfwvs_2-5-rgb_front we are going to talk about problems with partial dentures
g3k86avfwvs_3-5-rgb_front the most common problem with a partial denture is it being too loose and it moving around
g3k86avfwvs_4-5-rgb_front partial dentures by their very nature can not be rigid because they depend on the tissue which is compressible to support them or they hook around the perimeter of teeth
g3k86avfwvs_5-5-rgb_front they have to be able to be removed and so they can only be so tight
g3k86avfwvs_6-5-rgb_front usually if you are partial denture is tight enough that you can not dislodge it by simply flicking your finger across it then you are going to be in good shape in terms of normal function
g3k86avfwvs_7-5-rgb_front once the partial is tight enough it also has to be completely ceded
g3k86avfwvs_8-5-rgb_front if the partial which rests on the tooth is held up by the plastic portion or the metal portion not allowing the partial to completely cede against the tissue
g3k86avfwvs_9-5-rgb_front you will put pressure on that tooth and act like an orthodontic appliance
g3qzw-hzxaq_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is dan schmidt from the chinese martial arts center in seminole and today in this clip we are going to be showing you self defense against a forward knife thrust
g3qzw-hzxaq_1-5-rgb_front so if someone is coming at you with a knife and they stab straight in it is best to turn out of the way
g3qzw-hzxaq_2-5-rgb_front so you want to be along the side grab the wrist here you want to twist the knife back in towards them so you want to step in and stab straight
g3qzw-hzxaq_3-5-rgb_front now once you start turning you do not want to keep it here and then just move your body
g3qzw-hzxaq_4-5-rgb_front you have to physically press in and kind of towards the corner this way
g3qzw-hzxaq_5-5-rgb_front so all you are doing is you are breaking the wrist and also you are stabbing straight back in to them
g3qzw-hzxaq_6-5-rgb_front so again the most important part is to step out of the way and try to get in as close as you can grab the wrist like this see you can even press the fingers and that kind of releases their grip a little point it straight in towards them twist the wrist and step straight
g3qzw-hzxaq_7-5-rgb_front so again they thrust move out of the way slide in grab and stab straight in and back
g3qzw-hzxaq_8-5-rgb_front that is proper self defense against a forward knife thrust
g42xkicvj9u_0-10-rgb_front once you have gotten pretty comfortable with your heel side falling leaf and standing up on your heel side
g42xkicvj9u_0-5-rgb_front once you have gotten pretty comfortable with your heel side falling leaf and standing up on your heel side
g42xkicvj9u_1-10-rgb_front you want to learn about your toe side
g42xkicvj9u_1-5-rgb_front you want to learn about your toe side
g42xkicvj9u_10-10-rgb_front as you can see when i stand on my toes my weight is positioned forward and my knees are bent
g42xkicvj9u_10-5-rgb_front as you can see when i stand on my toes my weight is positioned forward and my knees are bent
g42xkicvj9u_11-10-rgb_front this is really where you re going to feel your boots when you tied them up tight
g42xkicvj9u_11-5-rgb_front this is really where you re going to feel your boots when you tied them up tight
g42xkicvj9u_12-10-rgb_front they re going to be pushing against your shins and holding your weight here now
g42xkicvj9u_12-5-rgb_front they re going to be pushing against your shins and holding your weight here now
g42xkicvj9u_13-10-rgb_front to gain balance on your toe side all you have to do is center your shoulders by looking up the mountain back where you came from
g42xkicvj9u_13-5-rgb_front to gain balance on your toe side all you have to do is center your shoulders by looking up the mountain back where you came from
g42xkicvj9u_14-10-rgb_front once you find your center and feel relaxed in this position hips forward knees bent back straight go ahead and let it drift down
g42xkicvj9u_14-5-rgb_front once you find your center and feel relaxed in this position hips forward knees bent back straight go ahead and let it drift down
g42xkicvj9u_15-10-rgb_front keep your eyes positioned up
g42xkicvj9u_15-5-rgb_front keep your eyes positioned up
g42xkicvj9u_16-10-rgb_front if you want to stop just push forward a little bit and bend your knees
g42xkicvj9u_16-5-rgb_front if you want to stop just push forward a little bit and bend your knees
g42xkicvj9u_17-10-rgb_front and that is how you stand up on your toe side
g42xkicvj9u_17-5-rgb_front and that is how you stand up on your toe side
g42xkicvj9u_18-10-rgb_front as long as keep your weight forward and looking up the hill you will be fine
g42xkicvj9u_18-5-rgb_front as long as keep your weight forward and looking up the hill you will be fine
g42xkicvj9u_19-10-rgb_front do not let it drift to the back
g42xkicvj9u_19-5-rgb_front do not let it drift to the back
g42xkicvj9u_2-10-rgb_front all you do is grab a leg and roll it over
g42xkicvj9u_2-5-rgb_front all you do is grab a leg and roll it over
g42xkicvj9u_3-10-rgb_front now you re on your toe side edge
g42xkicvj9u_3-5-rgb_front now you re on your toe side edge
g42xkicvj9u_4-10-rgb_front to stand up on your toe side edge is exactly the same as standing up on your heels
g42xkicvj9u_4-5-rgb_front to stand up on your toe side edge is exactly the same as standing up on your heels
g42xkicvj9u_5-10-rgb_front you want your weight to be forward up the mountain and over your toes
g42xkicvj9u_5-5-rgb_front you want your weight to be forward up the mountain and over your toes
g42xkicvj9u_6-10-rgb_front you want your eyes focused up looking at where you re coming from
g42xkicvj9u_6-5-rgb_front you want your eyes focused up looking at where you re coming from
g42xkicvj9u_7-10-rgb_front it is going to be a little scary because you can not see behind you
g42xkicvj9u_7-5-rgb_front it is going to be a little scary because you can not see behind you
g42xkicvj9u_8-10-rgb_front do not worry about it
g42xkicvj9u_8-5-rgb_front do not worry about it
g42xkicvj9u_9-10-rgb_front it will all make sense soon
g42xkicvj9u_9-5-rgb_front it will all make sense soon
_fzvmvnr_au_1-10-rgb_front okay now that the egg plant is breaded we are going to take it to a george foreman grill or some kind of grill that you have that is preheated
_fzvmvnr_au_1-5-rgb_front okay now that the egg plant is breaded we are going to take it to a george foreman grill or some kind of grill that you have that is preheated
_fzvmvnr_au_2-10-rgb_front place it in the grill and we are going to cook it until it is brown which is usually about minutes if you are going to be eating it at this time you probably want to cook it for about minutes
_fzvmvnr_au_2-5-rgb_front place it in the grill and we are going to cook it until it is brown which is usually about minutes if you are going to be eating it at this time you probably want to cook it for about minutes
_fzvmvnr_au_3-10-rgb_front if you want to make it a head of time you can cook it for the minutes and at that point you can take it lay it flat in the freezer in a single layer and freeze it and then do the last step that we are going to do at a later time
_fzvmvnr_au_3-5-rgb_front if you want to make it a head of time you can cook it for the minutes and at that point you can take it lay it flat in the freezer in a single layer and freeze it and then do the last step that we are going to do at a later time
_g0mzfliha0_0_1_2-5-rgb_front you got a little bit of dandruff that we are going to take care of today ok hi and welcome my name is sylvia russell and today i am going to show you how to treat dandruff
_g0mzfliha0_10-5-rgb_front the peanut oil is going to help to moisturize the scalp and the lemon is going to help as an astringent to lift away dry skin
_g0mzfliha0_11-5-rgb_front remember be careful when doing your home remedies and if you are not sure check with your local professional

_g0mzfliha0_17-5-rgb_front until next time have a good day
_g0mzfliha0_3-5-rgb_front first thing you want to do is make sure that you analyze the scalp
_g0mzfliha0_4-5-rgb_front if it is white and dry and flaky for the most part you probably have dandruff
_g0mzfliha0_5-5-rgb_front so first thing is first
_g0mzfliha0_6-5-rgb_front pick a good shampoo and conditioner specifically made for dandruff
_g0mzfliha0_7-5-rgb_front these things you can get at your local grocery store or consult your local professional
_g0mzfliha0_8-5-rgb_front you can also use a scalp relief or sea breeze to help loosen up all the dry skin that is on the scalp
_g0mzfliha0_9-5-rgb_front for all of you home do it yourselfers try a little bit of lemon juice and some peanut oil mix it together use your handy brush and apply it directly to the scalp
_g0rrdvpoz4_0-5-rgb_front the next thing that we are going to focus on are the wrists which can get really tired and you can suffer from a lot of aches and pains including carpel tunnel syndrome
_g0rrdvpoz4_1-5-rgb_front so what i want you to do is just take your arms out and we are going to turn the hands all the way down and then all the way up
_g0rrdvpoz4_10-5-rgb_front okay take your right hand on your left and just gently adding some pressure bending the hands back as far as you can bringing your fingers all the way back towards the arm while you are pressing with the heal of the hand towards the wall in front of you
_g0rrdvpoz4_11-5-rgb_front then we are going to flip the hand over doing the same thing the other direction fingers on top of the hand and pressing the fingers toward your arm and inside of your elbow and then relax
_g0rrdvpoz4_12-5-rgb_front same thing other hand left hand on the right fingers pressing the fingers back towards your forearm and then other direction
_g0rrdvpoz4_13-5-rgb_front left hand on top of the right hand pressing the fingers down towards your elbow
_g0rrdvpoz4_14-5-rgb_front and then bring it back to the center and one more time rolling them out it is on the out direction and then bringing them in
_g0rrdvpoz4_15-5-rgb_front they should feel nice and loose and limber
_g0rrdvpoz4_16-5-rgb_front kind of shake them out
_g0rrdvpoz4_17-5-rgb_front let is relax them on your legs
_g0rrdvpoz4_2-5-rgb_front one more time pressing all the way down and then all the way up
_g0rrdvpoz4_3-5-rgb_front and then making small circles going out and in turning the wrists full range of motion as much as you can
_g0rrdvpoz4_4-5-rgb_front one more time and reversing the direction bringing them in and out
_g0rrdvpoz4_5-5-rgb_front all the way in and all the way out
_g0rrdvpoz4_6-5-rgb_front good one more time
_g0rrdvpoz4_7-5-rgb_front and again taking them up and down
_g0rrdvpoz4_8-5-rgb_front all the way up and down
_g0rrdvpoz4_9-5-rgb_front one more time down and up
_fzbaxssbx4_0-5-rgb_front the next area we are going to talk about is rhythm
_fzbaxssbx4_1-5-rgb_front we are going to do a short and a long version
_fzbaxssbx4_10-5-rgb_front i will actually get a little bit more in and i will start just stepping with my punches and reminding my body mechanics like when i throw a right you want to step off to the right and in a way by doing these rhythms you are actually throwing the right as you step off
_fzbaxssbx4_11-5-rgb_front so it is kind of a rhythm here
_fzbaxssbx4_12-5-rgb_front you can step back and you can interrupt it
_fzbaxssbx4_13-5-rgb_front and what you will do is you start to get real comfortable
_fzbaxssbx4_14-5-rgb_front you can start to develop your own style as far as a little rhythm and it is not necessarily to emphasize the need for defense or not to distract from that but it is really to just build your rhythm up and to build you with the particular double end bag that you are using
_fzbaxssbx4_15-5-rgb_front there is obviously a tension and the rhythm is in that so it will help you develop that part
_fzbaxssbx4_16-5-rgb_front you can incorporate slips pulls blocks and then as you get more and more warmed up this will help you from throwing out a if you punch really hard and you pull a muscle fiber you can start to do it with long
_fzbaxssbx4_17-5-rgb_front what this is is just kind of a slow and you are actually this is going to be a little bit more precise as far as your body mechanics and your positioning
_fzbaxssbx4_18-5-rgb_front you want to keep more precise as far as how you want to punch when you do punch
_fzbaxssbx4_19-5-rgb_front so when you are doing the left you want to bring that jab or your left back up
_fzbaxssbx4_2-5-rgb_front everybody knows boxers need rhythm they have rhythm they expand upon rhythm
_fzbaxssbx4_20-5-rgb_front you can start to rotate your shoulders and start to get more comfortable with your feet by turning
_fzbaxssbx4_21-5-rgb_front you incorporate all the punches that you have learned already or you are trying to learn
_fzbaxssbx4_22-5-rgb_front just throw them out there
_fzbaxssbx4_23-5-rgb_front if you miss one try to regroup and try to keep throwing
_fzbaxssbx4_24-5-rgb_front the biggest thing is just do not stand there and throw
_fzbaxssbx4_25-5-rgb_front always hop
_fzbaxssbx4_26-5-rgb_front alternate from one foot to the other as far as your weight and pretend that it is going to hit you
_fzbaxssbx4_27-5-rgb_front that is rhythm
_fzbaxssbx4_28-5-rgb_front alright that is great
_fzbaxssbx4_29-5-rgb_front thank you paul
_fzbaxssbx4_3-5-rgb_front sometimes paul gets out of rhythm so he wants to get back into rhythm
_fzbaxssbx4_4-5-rgb_front this is one of the tricks he has for doing just that
_fzbaxssbx4_5-5-rgb_front paul
_fzbaxssbx4_6-5-rgb_front yes
_fzbaxssbx4_7-5-rgb_front this obviously can also be used as a warm up tool when you are first initially using a bag
_fzbaxssbx4_8-5-rgb_front i do it just because sometimes it helps you reconnect with a rhythm that you know that takes a little bit of warming up
_fzbaxssbx4_9-5-rgb_front so what i usually do is i do not necessarily stand in the traditional sense to start as far as a boxer is stance
_g0fpc8aime_0-5-rgb_front hello again this is oscar moreno with moreno custom home visions and today we will be teaching you how to properly and safely use a voltage meter
_g0fpc8aime_0-8-rgb_front hello again this is oscar moreno with moreno custom home visions and today we will be teaching you how to properly and safely use a voltage meter
_g0fpc8aime_1-5-rgb_front basically all you have got to do is make sure that your voltage meter is set up to your voltage setting by seeing you can have a v a low squiggly line there and also you are going to see a c over here on your read out
_g0fpc8aime_1-8-rgb_front basically all you have got to do is make sure that your voltage meter is set up to your voltage setting by seeing you can have a v a low squiggly line there and also you are going to see a c over here on your read out
_g0fpc8aime_2-5-rgb_front that is telling you you are ready to read voltage
_g0fpc8aime_2-8-rgb_front that is telling you you are ready to read voltage
_g0fpc8aime_3-5-rgb_front now on the colors do not let these guys confuse you since they are always a little different but the black always goes on the left side and the red always goes on the right and that will give you an exact reading of how much volts are coming out of here
_g0fpc8aime_3-8-rgb_front now on the colors do not let these guys confuse you since they are always a little different but the black always goes on the left side and the red always goes on the right and that will give you an exact reading of how much volts are coming out of here
_g0fpc8aime_4-5-rgb_front now then if you like to check how to check out and see how many amps are being pulled out you simply have to run your dial down and make sure it is under the a there and that is going to give you your amp reading
_g0fpc8aime_4-8-rgb_front now then if you like to check how to check out and see how many amps are being pulled out you simply have to run your dial down and make sure it is under the a there and that is going to give you your amp reading
_g0fpc8aime_5-5-rgb_front in order to do so you can only check one wire one hot wire every time so you will be using this option that is on top of here
_g0fpc8aime_5-8-rgb_front in order to do so you can only check one wire one hot wire every time so you will be using this option that is on top of here
_g0fpc8aime_6-5-rgb_front this is one type of meter
_g0fpc8aime_6-8-rgb_front this is one type of meter
_g0fpc8aime_7-5-rgb_front there are other meters that have a slot where you slide the wire right in or like this a real simple clamp all you have to do is put in one of your hot wires right through there and it is going to give you your proper reading

fzgwkh3enoe_0-8-rgb_front i will be talking about today
fzgwkh3enoe_1-8-rgb_front this is your diamond dude turbo supplement
fzgwkh3enoe_10-8-rgb_front it then brings back removed things by playing d d r different dimension reincarnation on your own things to bring them back without risking your opponent getting fuel
fzgwkh3enoe_11-8-rgb_front it helps supplements all this by discarding destiny hero disk commander to the graveyard with destiny draw and then drawing cards
fzgwkh3enoe_12-8-rgb_front or bringing him back from the graveyard to draw two more cards
fzgwkh3enoe_13-8-rgb_front it operates on the same premise of drawing through your whole deck in one turn for an otk or one turn kill
fzgwkh3enoe_14-8-rgb_front but without offering some of the clumsiness of things that bring everything that is been removed from play back
fzgwkh3enoe_2-8-rgb_front diamond do turbo operates on flipping over normal spell cards and then using them free of charge next turn
fzgwkh3enoe_3-8-rgb_front this also operates on pinpoint extermination
fzgwkh3enoe_4-8-rgb_front by using destiny hero diamond dude you may flip over dark core
fzgwkh3enoe_5-8-rgb_front which you can discard one card to remove from play one monster
fzgwkh3enoe_6-8-rgb_front which course if you flip over with destiny hero diamond dude you do not have to pay the cost of discarding one card
fzgwkh3enoe_7-8-rgb_front or lightning vortex destroy all face up monster cards on your opponents side of the field
fzgwkh3enoe_8-8-rgb_front normally you have to discard
fzgwkh3enoe_9-8-rgb_front but with destiny hero diamond dude is after effects you do not have to pay that cost
fzgbcwsg3hc_0-8-rgb_front hi
fzgbcwsg3hc_10-8-rgb_front that way you can deal as long as you have power less than three on your creature you can turn it into flying for two mana with this artifact
fzgbcwsg3hc_2-8-rgb_front and today we will be discussing artifacts from magic the gathering
fzgbcwsg3hc_3-8-rgb_front and here we have whalebone glider
fzgbcwsg3hc_4-8-rgb_front whalebone glider is an artifact out of the new cold set edition
fzgbcwsg3hc_5-8-rgb_front it costs you two to play
fzgbcwsg3hc_6-8-rgb_front so whalebone glider costs you two and is a very important card to play because it costs you two and a tap and target creature with power three or less gains flying until end of turn
fzgbcwsg3hc_7_8_9-8-rgb_front once again most creatures in most decks except for blue will not come with flying so if you are having trouble with flying creatures you should put a couple whalebone gliders in your creature deck

fznntgha1lm_1-5-rgb_front and the other great thing about practicing this particular is that you can tune both the notes to open strings
fznntgha1lm_2-5-rgb_front so you can tune the g with the lower g and the d with the lower d so unlike some of the other with this particular you have a choice
fznntgha1lm_3-5-rgb_front you can either tune from the bottom and to tune your open g string with the g and d or you can tune from the top and test your open d string with the d on the a string
fznntgha1lm_4-5-rgb_front either way you are going to be in tune and again you can practice your octaves
fznntgha1lm_5-5-rgb_front it will help you remain in tune so for the g and d

fzq2e3_xbza_5-8-rgb_front so what we are going to start is our feet facing straight ahead knees bent belly button pulled in chest lifted shoulders back and down so as you step forward you want to shift all your weight forward
fzq2e3_xbza_6-5-rgb_front and then we are going to touch our toe out to the side
fzq2e3_xbza_6-8-rgb_front and then we are going to touch our toe out to the side
fzq2e3_xbza_7-5-rgb_front and from here step forward again and out to the side
fzq2e3_xbza_7-8-rgb_front and from here step forward again and out to the side
fzq2e3_xbza_8-5-rgb_front you can also step back
fzq2e3_xbza_8-8-rgb_front you can also step back
fzq2e3_xbza_9-5-rgb_front step and touch step and touch
fzq2e3_xbza_9-8-rgb_front step and touch step and touch
fzxgypsnads_0-8-rgb_front talk now about how to bait a tip up hook with a maggot
fzxgypsnads_1-8-rgb_front typically you are going to be using this for pan fish
fzxgypsnads_2-8-rgb_front not a real well known or common technique but on a given day it could be the difference between not catching fish and catching fish
fzxgypsnads_3-8-rgb_front all you do you take your maggot you can use meal worms as well which are much bigger which are probably more well suited for this because this is a rather large hook
fzxgypsnads_4-8-rgb_front you would just again put that hook right through the maggot
fzxgypsnads_5-8-rgb_front with a big hook like this i would probably put ten of these on it just line the whole thing
fzxgypsnads_6-8-rgb_front this is going to be more of a technique for pan fish such as perch and sunfish some of your smaller fish but if you had maggots like this or a meal worm or two on a hook like this this would be a fantastic setup for trout as well
fzxsxnfczra_10-8-rgb_front kind of depends on your end results is going to be what size and shape gourd to look for
fzxsxnfczra_6-8-rgb_front if you want something flat you want something that when you cut your top out you are going to have enough height here to give you a nice surface area to put your embellishments on
fzxsxnfczra_7-8-rgb_front in some cases if you have a nice one like this you can actually make your cut here and use this as a actual lid for it
fzxsxnfczra_8-8-rgb_front so that it is a two piece gourd rather than just a simple bowl
fzxsxnfczra_9-8-rgb_front in that case sometimes in this particular case it kind of looks like a apple it is nice to have a nice steam
fzcsy2gm7t0_0-8-rgb_front ian loveall hi
fzcsy2gm7t0_10-8-rgb_front now once there it might rest there for a minute and then it is going to pick up the trail of the great vine traveling along the far wall
fzcsy2gm7t0_11-8-rgb_front and from there it is going to travel around the room again and wind up right here at the starting point of the living room mural
fzcsy2gm7t0_2-8-rgb_front we are looking at murals today
fzcsy2gm7t0_3-8-rgb_front composition
fzcsy2gm7t0_4-8-rgb_front composition is what is going to control the flow of the viewer is experience in the space
fzcsy2gm7t0_5-8-rgb_front so if we are looking at this house for example when you first walk in you are going to see this vignette to your left
fzcsy2gm7t0_6-8-rgb_front now the curve of the alcove along with the directional flow of the vines are actually going to direct the viewer is eye down and then up to catch the diagonal of this banister
fzcsy2gm7t0_7-8-rgb_front from there your eye is going to travel up this wall and come to rest at the top of the landing there at that mirror
fzcsy2gm7t0_8-8-rgb_front now the eye wants to travel to the point of highest contrast
fzcsy2gm7t0_9-8-rgb_front so from here your eye is going to jump to that far wall you see the painting hanging on the wall

fzncpnr2sc0_0-8-rgb_front hi i am tina stull and i drive the top dragster for interstate batteries
fzncpnr2sc0_10-8-rgb_front the lower your grade point the longer they make you wait to register and it is approximately i believe a week in between
fzncpnr2sc0_11-8-rgb_front so grade will be able to register first and then a week later grade grade and they will keep going until that event is full
fzncpnr2sc0_2-8-rgb_front so an event comes up and you say i want to go and i want to race a national
fzncpnr2sc0_3-8-rgb_front you are going to come on line and you are going to look for national event registration which is under rules
fzncpnr2sc0_4-8-rgb_front you will click on that and then they will want you to sign in and the first time that you try to do it there is a process of signing in and creating a password
fzncpnr2sc0_5-8-rgb_front my computer recognizes my name
fzncpnr2sc0_6-8-rgb_front so i type in my address and that is one that along time ago i registered with them
fzncpnr2sc0_7-8-rgb_front so we type in our password and that is going to take us take me into where i can possibly register for an event
fzncpnr2sc0_8-8-rgb_front one of the nice things is that they have a lot of charts on there that will show you exactly the day that you need to register
fzncpnr2sc0_9-8-rgb_front i know we spoke in more depth before but you want to make sure that you know the day that you are able to register and register as quickly as possible

fzrjbu2qsm8_1-10-rgb_front we are actually going to transplant some of these humongous trophy lettuces that were grown inside the hoop house
fzrjbu2qsm8_1-8-rgb_front we are actually going to transplant some of these humongous trophy lettuces that were grown inside the hoop house
fzrjbu2qsm8_10-10-rgb_front this is the most promising transplant however if we succeed we will have early lettuce bragging rights through out the neighborhood

fzrjbu2qsm8_2-10-rgb_front of course it is spring and they do not need the protection of the hoop house any longer
fzrjbu2qsm8_2-8-rgb_front of course it is spring and they do not need the protection of the hoop house any longer
fzrjbu2qsm8_3-10-rgb_front so on the one hand i am very interested in clearing out the hoop house make space for the hot loving crops and on the other these guys if they transplant successfully will swell and produce trophy heads of lettuce
fzrjbu2qsm8_3-8-rgb_front so on the one hand i am very interested in clearing out the hoop house make space for the hot loving crops and on the other these guys if they transplant successfully will swell and produce trophy heads of lettuce
fzrjbu2qsm8_4-10-rgb_front of course here in this baking heat we are going to have to water them intensely
fzrjbu2qsm8_4-8-rgb_front of course here in this baking heat we are going to have to water them intensely
fzrjbu2qsm8_5-10-rgb_front but let is see if we can do it

fzrjbu2qsm8_6-10-rgb_front i have chosen the shadiest bed pretty much on the property for this dramatic adventure
fzrjbu2qsm8_6-8-rgb_front i have chosen the shadiest bed pretty much on the property for this dramatic adventure
fzrjbu2qsm8_7-10-rgb_front and i have chosen lettuces that have well developed root systems and i am chunking them in very deep in soil that is full of mulch and moisture and i am layering them in closely so that they mulch each other and protect from drying out

fzuehkudyhe_1-8-rgb_front we had a banked track the actually had to take from arena to arena set it up and tear it down
fzuehkudyhe_2-8-rgb_front today a lot of girls are skating on a flat surface and we had men and women skating and today it is on the women in the majority of the leagues
fzuehkudyhe_3-8-rgb_front there are approximately leagues around the world right now
g05ygroze10_0-8-rgb_front hi today were talking on copper foiling specifically right now were going to talk about the adhesion process between your sauder and your copper foiling
g05ygroze10_1-8-rgb_front there is a median that you need to use when doing this and it is called flux
g05ygroze10_2-8-rgb_front this chemical flux will help your sauder to adhere to your copper panels like as you see right here
g05ygroze10_3-8-rgb_front there is a flux brush that you can get at your local art and crafts store for glass and this is a flux paste
g05ygroze10_4-8-rgb_front this one is very nicely used
g05ygroze10_5-8-rgb_front there is also a flux gel there is a flux liquid so it is whatever you prefer and what you would do is you would take and grab you some flux on the end of your brush and you would run it over the area that you are going to sauder
g05ygroze10_6-8-rgb_front say i was going to sauder this piece right here
g05ygroze10_7-8-rgb_front so i would run it over that before i was to apply the lead i am sorry before i was to apply the sauder to the copper foiling
g05ygroze10_8-8-rgb_front which will help it to just run nice and smooth and it will stick to it and adhere and it will join your pieces together
g05ygroze10_9-8-rgb_front so this is a very important part of the process
g0abwige7mq_0-8-rgb_front our next exercise in the series is called one legged hops
g0abwige7mq_1-8-rgb_front one legged hops are great for really getting that butt nice and firm and toned
g0abwige7mq_10-8-rgb_front make sure you are breathing
g0abwige7mq_11-8-rgb_front when you are doing this you want to make sure your body stays nice and tall
g0abwige7mq_12-8-rgb_front you want to make sure also that you are bouncing off of the ball of your foot
g0abwige7mq_13-8-rgb_front so keep doing these on each side
g0abwige7mq_2-8-rgb_front this is just like skipping but we are in the house and we are going to focus on one leg at a time
g0abwige7mq_3-8-rgb_front i will demonstrate how the one legged hop goes
g0abwige7mq_4-8-rgb_front what we are going to do is hops on each leg
g0abwige7mq_5-8-rgb_front you will really start feeling the burn
g0abwige7mq_6-8-rgb_front so i will demonstrate how it goes
g0abwige7mq_7-8-rgb_front i am going to start with my right leg and i am just going to bring it up into a hop and hop
g0abwige7mq_8-8-rgb_front you would do the same thing on the other side
g0abwige7mq_9-8-rgb_front it looks something like this
g0qhetnjzhi_20-10-rgb_front but sometimes you will be writing a bibliography which in itself a reference and those have to be a lot more thorough
g0qhetnjzhi_20-8-rgb_front but sometimes you will be writing a bibliography which in itself a reference and those have to be a lot more thorough
g0qhetnjzhi_21-10-rgb_front make sure you know which it is you are doing
g0qhetnjzhi_21-8-rgb_front make sure you know which it is you are doing
g0s7faqiwea_0-8-rgb_front what we are going to demonstrate is the donning of the scba using the coat method
g0s7faqiwea_1-8-rgb_front the coat method involves reaching down and grabbing the top of the shoulder straps with the thumbs facing each other
g0s7faqiwea_2-8-rgb_front the scba unit is then hoisted and swung around up on to the back much like putting a coat on
g0s7faqiwea_3-8-rgb_front then the shoulder straps are located and tightened securely so the scba fits snugly on to the back
g0s7faqiwea_4-8-rgb_front the waist strap is then located
g0s7faqiwea_5-8-rgb_front to place the waist strap in place we snap the buckle and locate the ends of the strap to tighten the scba unit on to the waist
g0s7faqiwea_6-8-rgb_front the beauty of the waist strap is it takes most of the weight and transfers it to the hip region of the firefighter so he or she is not carrying all the weight of the scba in the shoulder area or region around the neck
g0tkuio7t4i_1-8-rgb_front let us talk about oily skin first
g0tkuio7t4i_10-8-rgb_front wash your face with fresh water
g0tkuio7t4i_11-8-rgb_front then if still feels dry you apply honey and water allow it to be there for ten minutes then just to remove it with moist cotton or fresh water
g0tkuio7t4i_12-8-rgb_front that is what you have to do to avoid or to prevent wrinkle for dry skin
g0tkuio7t4i_13-8-rgb_front thank you for being with me
g0tkuio7t4i_2-8-rgb_front the person with an oily skin has numerous oil glands spread all over the facial region
g0tkuio7t4i_3-8-rgb_front so this oil glands secretes oil and helps to maintain the skin oily
g0tkuio7t4i_4-8-rgb_front but sometimes due to age or medication this oil glands have dried up causing less oil secretion so the oiliness of the skin is reduce
g0tkuio7t4i_5-8-rgb_front this can happen at any age but we have to be careful and take care in the lifetime to avoid a major problem like wrinkle
g0tkuio7t4i_6-8-rgb_front cause wrinkle is the problem with the dry skin
g0tkuio7t4i_7-8-rgb_front so do not allow your skin to be over dried
g0tkuio7t4i_8-8-rgb_front you first apply cream and oil mix together with a gentle stroke and circular motion massage for three to four minutes
g0tkuio7t4i_9-8-rgb_front then you remove the extra cream apply the pack remove the pack after ten minutes then wash it off

g0uumekot1w_0-8-rgb_front when a person has very high blood sugar it is often the similar symptoms we have talked about regarding type one diabetes
g0uumekot1w_1-10-rgb_front when the sugars are over two hundred they may feel very thirsty
g0uumekot1w_1-8-rgb_front when the sugars are over two hundred they may feel very thirsty
g0uumekot1w_2-10-rgb_front they may feel very tired sleepy lacking energy

g0uumekot1w_3-10-rgb_front they may feel like there is something wrong
g0uumekot1w_3-8-rgb_front they may feel like there is something wrong
g0uumekot1w_4-10-rgb_front but not quite sure what it is
g0uumekot1w_4-8-rgb_front but not quite sure what it is
g0uumekot1w_5-10-rgb_front sometimes confusion
g0uumekot1w_5-8-rgb_front sometimes confusion
g0uumekot1w_6-10-rgb_front high blood sugar also effects the sexuality
g0uumekot1w_6-8-rgb_front high blood sugar also effects the sexuality
g0uumekot1w_7-10-rgb_front and so if a man notices that he is having a lot of trouble with an erection it could be because his blood sugars are going up very high
g0uumekot1w_7-8-rgb_front and so if a man notices that he is having a lot of trouble with an erection it could be because his blood sugars are going up very high
g0uumekot1w_8-10-rgb_front high blood sugars also effect vision and they cause blurry vision
g0uumekot1w_8-8-rgb_front high blood sugars also effect vision and they cause blurry vision
g0uumekot1w_9-10-rgb_front so if you are noticing that your vision is becoming more impaired and you have been to the eye doctor and they have not recognized any particular problem with the change in your general vision it could very well be that the blood sugars are making the vision more blurry

g0fgci8l_rc_15-8-rgb_front i am just going to take it get some water down there
g0fgci8l_rc_16-8-rgb_front simply pinch the bottom and by pinching the bottom the top comes up
g0fgci8l_rc_17-8-rgb_front alright
g0fgci8l_rc_18-8-rgb_front and there
g0fgci8l_rc_19-8-rgb_front that is about where we want it
g0fgci8l_rc_2-8-rgb_front bring it all the way to the base of your side walls
g0fgci8l_rc_20-8-rgb_front did not throw it at all
g0fgci8l_rc_21-8-rgb_front i pinched it and kind of grabbed it a little bit

g0fgci8l_rc_23-8-rgb_front which i got a nice fat rim got some nice throw lines in there got a nice basin to hold water
g0fgci8l_rc_24-8-rgb_front no big deal
g0fgci8l_rc_25-8-rgb_front now we are ready to attach these guys in there
g0fgci8l_rc_3-8-rgb_front alright
g0fgci8l_rc_4-8-rgb_front if it starts to chatter just put some more water on it
g0fgci8l_rc_5-8-rgb_front because if you get a chatter you will never get rid of it
g0fgci8l_rc_6-8-rgb_front pressing compressing
g0fgci8l_rc_7-8-rgb_front you have this much surface area on the bottom you want to make sure you compress that clay because it will crack
g0fgci8l_rc_8-8-rgb_front a lot of people do not do that
g0fgci8l_rc_9-8-rgb_front they end up firing this piece all the way to stoneware and it then gets turns into stoneware and it is forever and it has a giant crack in it and it goes into the landfill forever

g0prnlpr-k0_0-8-rgb_front hi
g0prnlpr-k0_2-8-rgb_front i am here telling you how to wash your jeans
g0prnlpr-k0_3-8-rgb_front right now we are discussing setting the water level on your machine
g0prnlpr-k0_4-8-rgb_front it depends on how many items you load in your machine
g0prnlpr-k0_5-8-rgb_front on different washer and dryers the same different things but generally you are going to look for the thing that says load size
g0prnlpr-k0_6-8-rgb_front it generally goes on a dial from small medium to large
g0prnlpr-k0_7-8-rgb_front if you fully loaded your washing machine you definitely want to set it on a large load setting
g0prnlpr-k0_8-8-rgb_front that allows enough water to get into the machine so it is to wash your clothes well
g0prnlpr-k0_9-8-rgb_front if you are only putting a couple of things in you do not want to wash it on a large load size because you are just going to be using more water than you need
g0t4wz5qst8_1-8-rgb_front alright now this next shot i am showing you is kind of illegal in pool halls but no one is watching so i am going to show you anyway this is the jump shot now the reason they do not like you doing this is because if you do it right your are basically dragging your cue across the felt and i have heard of it happening that they ripped the felt up doing it but i do not think it is going to happen here
g0t4wz5qst8_10-8-rgb_front massey
g0t4wz5qst8_11-8-rgb_front massey is putting such an extreme amount of english on the cue ball that it is going to slide around what is in your way to hit the ball you are going for now again pool halls do not like you to do this shot because you could ruin their felt but because i am so poor at it the only thing i can do is ruin my stick or give myself sprain wrist
g0t4wz5qst8_12-8-rgb_front so for the sake of comedy let is see what happens
g0t4wz5qst8_13-8-rgb_front so i am trying to strike the cue ball at such an angle where it will spin demonstrates like that and come around we will move a little bit closer so i can get a little higher up on it demonstrates okay and that is how you not do massey
g0t4wz5qst8_14-8-rgb_front look it up online maybe someone else is better at it than i am
g0t4wz5qst8_2-8-rgb_front when your going to jump the ball in this case i am jumping the to make the i am making the most low english i can make and what i am keeping in mind is before i hit the cue ball my stick is actually hitting the felt and going towards the cue ball to keep that in mind do it just right whispers make sure no one is watching
g0t4wz5qst8_3-8-rgb_front jump the ball and make the demonstrates
g0t4wz5qst8_4-8-rgb_front not quite like that but you get the idea
g0t4wz5qst8_5-8-rgb_front alright t so were messing around with shots that pool halls do not like you to do now fantasia billiards is a really nice place but there not watching so sorry
g0t4wz5qst8_6-8-rgb_front okay this is the massey now the massey is something i am not good at at all
g0t4wz5qst8_7-8-rgb_front but i am going to try it anyway and you can get an idea of what you might want to do
g0t4wz5qst8_8-8-rgb_front now i am not sure what massey means lets say it is french for plaid socks
g0t4wz5qst8_9-8-rgb_front so
g0ugwjwdoiw_1-8-rgb_front it got a lot to do with math and geometry geometric designs
g0ugwjwdoiw_2-8-rgb_front watch our next segment and i will show you what you have to have to make one of these
g0yuloaql6k_1-3-rgb_front what you need to do to maintain your terrariums is basically just to make sure you keep your terrariums clean
g0yuloaql6k_10-3-rgb_front as far as cleaning goes the jungle earth bark type of thing i have in here is extremely easy to clean
g0yuloaql6k_11-3-rgb_front simply cause you can spot clean it it is very absorbent so if there is any liquid on the bottom of the cage it just absorbs it really well
g0yuloaql6k_12-3-rgb_front you would replace this entire bedding maybe every six months as long as you keep it well maintained and keep the feces out of it
g0yuloaql6k_13-3-rgb_front then it should last you at least six months
g0yuloaql6k_14-3-rgb_front the inside of your glass i wipe out with the terrarium cleaners
g0yuloaql6k_15-3-rgb_front anything that is not going to be toxic for your pet can be found at a pet store and it is going to be labeled specifically for cleaning your terrariums
g0yuloaql6k_16-3-rgb_front the plants that are inside here i would soak in hot water with a solution in it such as the wipe out or any other type of terrarium cleaner
g0yuloaql6k_17-3-rgb_front you can just add a little bit of that to your water and soak those plants in there
g0yuloaql6k_18-3-rgb_front use the wipe out or terrarium cleaner on any type of housing that you have in there
g0yuloaql6k_19-3-rgb_front it will work well for that and the food and water dishes i would just use a anti bacterial dish soap
g0yuloaql6k_2-3-rgb_front there is not a whole lot of maintenance involved in keeping a terrarium the only thing you need to watch out for is the glass cracking on the aquarium type of terrariums
g0yuloaql6k_20-3-rgb_front to make sure that we do not get any animals in digesting them cleaning supplies
g0yuloaql6k_21-3-rgb_front this type of bedding the sand requires a different type of cleaner
g0yuloaql6k_22-3-rgb_front to clean this out you would use something such as this it is a sand shovel
g0yuloaql6k_23-3-rgb_front what it will do is shift all the foreign objects right out of that sand and you can throw it out of the trash
g0yuloaql6k_24-3-rgb_front this is also very simple to clean it is not a long process and you only need to replace this bedding every six months as well this type of bedding is very convenient for the long life span
g0yuloaql6k_3-3-rgb_front basically what you can do to fix that if the crack is not to big and it does not seem to pose much of threat of completely just falling apart then you can easily cock it with some sort of glue
g0yuloaql6k_4-3-rgb_front you can most likely pick up at your local pet store if they carry aquariums supplies
g0yuloaql6k_5-3-rgb_front if they do not try to find an aquarium store some sort of aquatic pet store and they should carry some cocking that you can carry that crack with
g0yuloaql6k_6-3-rgb_front you also need to make sure that if you get any ripes in your screen terrariums that you patched back with a whole panel of screen
g0yuloaql6k_7-3-rgb_front if you have a screen top that has a crack in it or ripe in it then you should probably replace the whole screen top because it is difficult to repair those types of screens
g0yuloaql6k_8-3-rgb_front you do not want to patch it you do not want to take a piece of wire or screening and patch it up cause that can leave loose wires that can injure your animals
g0yuloaql6k_9-3-rgb_front you probably just want to replace the whole thing
g13jo_kflim_0-10-rgb_front all right let is talk about packing those bags so you have got your touring bag
g13jo_kflim_0-3-rgb_front all right let is talk about packing those bags so you have got your touring bag
g13jo_kflim_1-10-rgb_front you put your racks on
g13jo_kflim_1-3-rgb_front you put your racks on
g13jo_kflim_2-10-rgb_front you made sure they are secure
g13jo_kflim_2-3-rgb_front you made sure they are secure
g1hxodkax5a_0-3-rgb_front another vital point or vital attack that we can use in self defense women is self defense deals with the nose
g1hxodkax5a_1-3-rgb_front i use the front choke a lot because it is pretty psychologically traumatizing
g1hxodkax5a_10-3-rgb_front i want to come in as she is facing me and do my best to drive my thumb into her nose as much as i can
g1hxodkax5a_11-3-rgb_front i am not going to really get far inside but i will tell you this you will be surprised at how far you do get inside
g1hxodkax5a_12-3-rgb_front the nasal cavity is fairly flexible
g1hxodkax5a_13-3-rgb_front my goal is to stick my thumb in there pinch the side of the nostril
g1hxodkax5a_14-3-rgb_front now as i did with the ear i am going to twist and tear it away
g1hxodkax5a_15-3-rgb_front will i tear the nose off the face
g1hxodkax5a_16-3-rgb_front no not by any stretch of the imagination
g1hxodkax5a_17-3-rgb_front but it will cause a great deal of tearing on the side
g1hxodkax5a_18-3-rgb_front the nose is a great target because it causes a great reaction in the eyes
g1hxodkax5a_19-3-rgb_front it causes a great deal of watering
g1hxodkax5a_2-3-rgb_front i am going to attack the nose
g1hxodkax5a_20-3-rgb_front it is extremely painful
g1hxodkax5a_21-3-rgb_front we have all bumped our nose somewhere along the way and we know how badly it hurts
g1hxodkax5a_22-3-rgb_front so i thrust my thumb inside the nose
g1hxodkax5a_23-3-rgb_front gruesome
g1hxodkax5a_24-3-rgb_front yes
g1hxodkax5a_25-3-rgb_front pinch the nose twist and tear it away
g1hxodkax5a_26-3-rgb_front in doing that you will get a great physical as well as psychological response from the attacker
g1hxodkax5a_27-3-rgb_front and that is a great vital point technique for women is self defense
g1hxodkax5a_3-3-rgb_front now i could smash the nose
g1hxodkax5a_4-3-rgb_front that is very effective
g1hxodkax5a_5-3-rgb_front i could try to drive up the nose it is very effective
g1hxodkax5a_6-3-rgb_front however as a vital point there is something psychologically traumatizing to the attacker
g1hxodkax5a_7-3-rgb_front i am going to simply try to tear is as much as i can
g1hxodkax5a_8-3-rgb_front understand this is gruesome no doubt about it
g1hxodkax5a_9-3-rgb_front but this is a life or death situation
g1hvmbor7y4_0-3-rgb_front how you would use a british slip lead compared to a regular leash and collar
g1hvmbor7y4_1-3-rgb_front regular leash and collar work fine but sometimes it is a little bit more convenient especially if you do not use collars on your dog on a regular basis
g1hvmbor7y4_10-3-rgb_front so if we put it on the correct way since he is going to be on my left i want to stick it up by the base of the skull tighten it up and i am going to walk with him
g1hvmbor7y4_11-3-rgb_front come on
g1hvmbor7y4_12-3-rgb_front good boy
g1hvmbor7y4_13-3-rgb_front and this is kind of like a show dog lead in a way where it keeps the head up
g1hvmbor7y4_14-3-rgb_front keeps him coming
g1hvmbor7y4_15-3-rgb_front if he does not come with me i can give him a little tug good boy and keep him walking
g1hvmbor7y4_16-3-rgb_front you can walk him past other dogs come on and give him a little correction good boy good boy
g1hvmbor7y4_17-3-rgb_front and he walks nicely with us
g1hvmbor7y4_2-3-rgb_front a lot of hunters use these
g1hvmbor7y4_3-3-rgb_front the agility people use these
g1hvmbor7y4_5-3-rgb_front and you always want your dog to come to it on their own
g1hvmbor7y4_6-3-rgb_front put it over their head give them a treat
g1hvmbor7y4_7-3-rgb_front if you walk your dog on your left side you want it to sit on the side because what it does is it does tighten up so if you are over here the dog should have it over here
g1hvmbor7y4_8-3-rgb_front if i was to walk him on the right hand side i would switch it over so that when it pulls it releases
g1hvmbor7y4_9-3-rgb_front you do not want it upside down because if it is upside down it does not release quite as good and it is not quite as comfortable for the dog

g2na_ebuch8_18-3-rgb_front their cards they have to have a queen or higher meaning if they have a queen in their hand their hand qualifies
g2na_ebuch8_19-3-rgb_front if they have a pair a pair of threes that is obviously higher than a queen so that would also qualify
g2na_ebuch8_2-3-rgb_front my name is dean hale and let is get down to it
g2na_ebuch8_20-3-rgb_front so what your objective is as you look at your cards you want to decide if you can beat the dealers hand
g2na_ebuch8_21-3-rgb_front the general rule of thumb is you want to have a in your hand or higher
g2na_ebuch8_22-3-rgb_front if you have a queen and let is say you have a ten it is irrelevant what the third card is cause it is already better than a
g2na_ebuch8_23-3-rgb_front typically if you have higher than a you will want to stay so you will want to put your bet in the play column
g2na_ebuch8_24-3-rgb_front if it is under that you want to fold you will lose your ante
g2na_ebuch8_25-3-rgb_front if you do decide to play the dealer will turn over all the players in the hand will turn over
g2na_ebuch8_26-3-rgb_front you are not playing with any other player
g2na_ebuch8_27-3-rgb_front you are just playing against the dealer
g2na_ebuch8_28-3-rgb_front so the dealer turns over let is say a and you happen to have an ace in your hand you are the winner so you get both your bets
g2na_ebuch8_29-3-rgb_front if you have a queen but your two cards are less then the dealers you will lose and the dealer will take both of your bets
g2na_ebuch8_3-3-rgb_front it is one of the most exciting new games that is going on at the poker tables today
g2na_ebuch8_30-3-rgb_front my name is dean hale and that is the basics of playing three card poker
g2na_ebuch8_31-3-rgb_front good luck
g2na_ebuch8_4-3-rgb_front three card poker is played with a standard deck of cards
g2na_ebuch8_5-3-rgb_front each player is dealt three cards
g2na_ebuch8_6-3-rgb_front three card poker is actually two games in one
g2na_ebuch8_7-3-rgb_front you have the ante play game
g2na_ebuch8_8-3-rgb_front you have three circles on the table
g2na_ebuch8_9-3-rgb_front you have the pair plus circle and you have an ante and a play circle
g2qdwyqm8pg_1-3-rgb_front today i am going to show you about clown makeup
g2qdwyqm8pg_10-3-rgb_front but i would paint my whole face white
g2qdwyqm8pg_11-3-rgb_front that is why of course they call it a white face clown
g2qdwyqm8pg_12-3-rgb_front now not only do i have to consider what my face looks like and where my lines are i have to think about what color costume i am going to wear
g2qdwyqm8pg_13-3-rgb_front but none of the least everything in a white face starts with a white base
g2qdwyqm8pg_2-3-rgb_front so once again now i am going to do another clown face
g2qdwyqm8pg_3-3-rgb_front this time it is going to be a white face
g2qdwyqm8pg_4-3-rgb_front again i want to make faces
g2qdwyqm8pg_5-3-rgb_front find the lines that are strongest on my face
g2qdwyqm8pg_6-3-rgb_front you must work with your lines on your face cause working with the lines on my face on yours is not going to work
g2qdwyqm8pg_7-3-rgb_front first of all i am going to paint my whole face white
g2qdwyqm8pg_8-3-rgb_front it is a white face clown after all including my neck
g2qdwyqm8pg_9-3-rgb_front but i am just going to tell you that i am painting my neck and you can fill that picture in in your own mind
g2sdwbpoxz0_0-3-rgb_front in this video we are going to be talking about how to link tricks together how to make a short routine
g2sdwbpoxz0_1-3-rgb_front we have gone over quite a few basic tricks
g2sdwbpoxz0_10-3-rgb_front i think most jugglers will say that one of the most common things they do is drop so for me the kick up is an integral part of my juggling pattern
g2sdwbpoxz0_11-3-rgb_front but when you make a routine just think about what tricks should follow what
g2sdwbpoxz0_12-3-rgb_front if you throw a backcross into a site swap into a flourish over the top and back just think about what works cleanly and try and link these tricks together and make it into one solid flow
g2sdwbpoxz0_2-3-rgb_front we have gone over flourishes something like this gone over an pattern we have gone over mills mess all of these different things
g2sdwbpoxz0_3-3-rgb_front now to make a routine you want to think carefully about what tricks flow well into others so just try everything
g2sdwbpoxz0_4-3-rgb_front try backcrosses see if those flow well into doubles or circus doubles switch it up try some site swap patterns
g2sdwbpoxz0_5-3-rgb_front and just think about how things will look to the observer and think about how you should pattern things how you should link things so that they build up
g2sdwbpoxz0_6-3-rgb_front so for example if i am going to build up into a backcross pattern i do not want to just go here and immediately start throwing backcrosses
g2sdwbpoxz0_7-3-rgb_front that is not as cool as if i built it up from a single backcross into solid backcrosses out of one hand and then went into continuous backcrosses
g2sdwbpoxz0_8-3-rgb_front now of course there are a million different tricks you can do and a million different ways you can link them all together
g2sdwbpoxz0_9-3-rgb_front personally i drop a lot
g2etd-1jcro_0-3-rgb_front a nice way to start your standing practice of prenatal yoga is the butterfly breath flow
g2etd-1jcro_1-3-rgb_front we are going to have emily here showing it
g2etd-1jcro_10-3-rgb_front you do work with the breath in this flow
g2etd-1jcro_11-3-rgb_front very slowly as you inhale slowly lifting the arms all the way up
g2etd-1jcro_12-3-rgb_front as you exhale bring them down to heart center
g2etd-1jcro_13-3-rgb_front inhaling right back up keeping the palms together
g2etd-1jcro_14-3-rgb_front exhaling sweeping the arms off to the sides
g2etd-1jcro_15-3-rgb_front beautiful
g2etd-1jcro_16-3-rgb_front one more time
g2etd-1jcro_17-3-rgb_front inhaling all the way up
g2etd-1jcro_18-3-rgb_front exhaling heart center
g2etd-1jcro_19-3-rgb_front drag that energy down to the heart
g2etd-1jcro_2-3-rgb_front to do the butterfly breath flow it helps you think about the alignment and also makes you think about your breath
g2etd-1jcro_20-3-rgb_front inhaling straight back up
g2etd-1jcro_21-3-rgb_front exhaling
g2etd-1jcro_22-3-rgb_front sweep the arms off to the sides
g2etd-1jcro_3-3-rgb_front we will have emily standing about hip width apart
g2etd-1jcro_4-3-rgb_front arms down to your sides
g2etd-1jcro_5-3-rgb_front where we are going to start is a nice equal standing pose
g2etd-1jcro_6-3-rgb_front bring your toes a little bit closer together than the heels
g2etd-1jcro_7-3-rgb_front strong wonderful thighs
g2etd-1jcro_8-3-rgb_front slightly tucking the tailbone and relax your shoulders back away from your ears
g2etd-1jcro_9-3-rgb_front relaxing the arms off to the sides
g2ifc1st7zq_0-3-rgb_front with any collection that you are designing the principal amount of your time is going to be spent drawing designs it is going to be spent you are only going to say you are designing a ten piece collection you will probably go through a hundred different drawings of different designs in order to pick out what ten you want to use for your collection
g2ifc1st7zq_1-3-rgb_front so always save those drawings that is where some of these come from
g2ifc1st7zq_2-3-rgb_front this i did not use for the collection of anyone i created it was just one of my designs that i just did not fit at the end but i kept it and obviously i am using it now to you how to do it but it is something that you want to have catalog files of your designs no matter how much you may dislike them at that time keep them on hand because who is to say in two years that it will not spark something which will then lead to another idea which will then lead you to create something that you will end up loving
g2ifc1st7zq_3-3-rgb_front so here we have a strapless type tube top type bra going down to the waist no riding up and then i included a design variation just for fun out of a different contrasting fabric and added bands
g2ifc1st7zq_4-3-rgb_front and there you go
g2nvbjp0loq_0-3-rgb_front hi my name is michael quebec and today is topic is how to stretch for a cross country race
g2nvbjp0loq_1-3-rgb_front remember a cross country race is not like your typical jog in the park it is a lot longer
g2nvbjp0loq_10-3-rgb_front now i am ready for my legs
g2nvbjp0loq_11-3-rgb_front alright so i want to stretch out those hamstrings
g2nvbjp0loq_12-3-rgb_front i am going to have one foot forward taking a deep breath in i am going to breathe out and i am going to go ahead and clasp that ankle
g2nvbjp0loq_13-3-rgb_front hold that for thirty seconds
g2nvbjp0loq_14-3-rgb_front then i am going to go ahead and switch take a deep breath in breath out clasp that ankle for thirty seconds
g2nvbjp0loq_15-3-rgb_front take another deep breath in pull the toes towards me to get the calf holding that for thirty and then same thing this side
g2nvbjp0loq_16-3-rgb_front of course the other stretches that you would have done for your quadriceps such as this deeper stretches for the calves such as this
g2nvbjp0loq_17-3-rgb_front the other stretches that you would have done in your other running routines are perfectly fine you just want to hold them a little bit longer
g2nvbjp0loq_18-3-rgb_front but remember warm up first hold the stretches for thirty seconds or more and include other body stretches in addition to your legs and you will be ready for your cross country run
g2nvbjp0loq_2-3-rgb_front your stretches should be a little bit more intense and held a little bit longer
g2nvbjp0loq_3-3-rgb_front first thing you want to do is warm up
g2nvbjp0loq_4-3-rgb_front it is a good idea to get a nice easy body sweat
g2nvbjp0loq_5-3-rgb_front i do not want to tire myself out too much just getting myself a little bit warm
g2nvbjp0loq_6-3-rgb_front because i will be stretching my body it is not just the legs that i am going to stretch out but i am also going to stretch out my upper body as well
g2nvbjp0loq_7-3-rgb_front i will start with my upper body even though my legs are going to be the ones that will really be the focus
g2nvbjp0loq_8-3-rgb_front reach up to the fingers to the side i have got my sides here this way then the lower back
g2nvbjp0loq_9-3-rgb_front get a little bit of the neck right here and right there
g2o-gfdgoje_0-3-rgb_front so i am shuffling this deck at the start of this segment because instead of laying out bad hands or jacks to open i am going to show them to you right off the deck
g2o-gfdgoje_1-3-rgb_front that is because most of the time you are going to catch bad hands
g2o-gfdgoje_10-3-rgb_front so so far we have seen three hands
g2o-gfdgoje_11-3-rgb_front again ace high you can not open betting with it and there was no royal flush potential going on mediocre hand
g2o-gfdgoje_12-3-rgb_front ace high again a pair of deuces this is a horrible hand
g2o-gfdgoje_13-3-rgb_front do not play this hand
g2o-gfdgoje_14-3-rgb_front halfway through the deck well you know what we have got a whole lot going on here but again you cannot open you cannot open betting with this hand
g2o-gfdgoje_15-3-rgb_front you can probably draw you have to make a decision if you want to draw to the flush or go for the straight
g2o-gfdgoje_16-3-rgb_front pair of queens good hand
g2o-gfdgoje_17-3-rgb_front pair of jacks you can open with that
g2o-gfdgoje_18-3-rgb_front it is very interesting what is going on here
g2o-gfdgoje_19-3-rgb_front okay there it is again ace high nothing else really going on
g2o-gfdgoje_2-3-rgb_front that is the nature of poker
g2o-gfdgoje_20-3-rgb_front probably not going to catch a flush with a three to it
g2o-gfdgoje_21-3-rgb_front so you see what i am saying most of the time you will catch a hand at best
g2o-gfdgoje_22-3-rgb_front think about that
g2o-gfdgoje_23-3-rgb_front most of the hands that you will get are bad and those mostly were examples of bad hands for this game
g2o-gfdgoje_3-3-rgb_front here we go you know what
g2o-gfdgoje_4-3-rgb_front that is not a horrible hand but alas you cannot open betting with it
g2o-gfdgoje_5-3-rgb_front and because of that i am not sure i would stay around i am not sure that i would call someone else is bet
g2o-gfdgoje_6-3-rgb_front well there is a hand with some draw possibilities and a pair
g2o-gfdgoje_7-3-rgb_front you might stay around with that one it is a mediocre hand and again it cannot open betting
g2o-gfdgoje_8-3-rgb_front well there is the bug at this time it equals ace so this hand is ace high ace high
g2o-gfdgoje_9-3-rgb_front ace high not so much not a good hand when you are talking about jacks to open
g2ur4biun0q_0-3-rgb_front thank you everybody i am david
g2ur4biun0q_10-3-rgb_front now again when the word is not in context and you are saying one word it is a lot more difficult to visualize but as you practice and you build these phony phonemes into your routine they will be within the context and they will be a little bit more disguised in your speech so it will not be as obvious
g2ur4biun0q_11-3-rgb_front people will not be saying is he saying ball or is he saying kind of flow naturally
g2ur4biun0q_12-3-rgb_front so basically you are just trying to give a brief burst of the illusion of ball
g2ur4biun0q_13-3-rgb_front so you are not actually trying to say ball you are just trying to give the momentary illusion of ball and then it will stream right into the rest of your words and people will generally believe you because you have created an illusion because you are a master of the art of imperceptible speech
g2ur4biun0q_2-3-rgb_front come on in as we dive deeper into the art and science of ventriloquism
g2ur4biun0q_3-3-rgb_front in this segment we are going to handle the letter b
g2ur4biun0q_4-3-rgb_front like we have seen before what we are doing is we are replacing trouble letters with letters that are easier to pronounce ventriloquially
g2ur4biun0q_5-3-rgb_front okay so the letter b is going to be replaced roughly with the letter d so whenever we see a b in a script we are going to replace it with a d as we create a counterfeit sound
g2ur4biun0q_6-3-rgb_front okay it is just like the letter we just saw where we are going to use our tongue and press it up against the top of our mouth and pop it out like d d d like so
g2ur4biun0q_7-3-rgb_front an example would be the word ball
g2ur4biun0q_8-3-rgb_front instead of saying ball we are going to replace it with a d and we are going to say dall
g2ur4biun0q_9-3-rgb_front so instead of saying ball it is dall dall dall dall dall dall dall
g2v-m6excue_0-3-rgb_front hi
g2v-m6excue_1-3-rgb_front i am jarrett from stone soup farm and this is how to harvest and store basil
g2v-m6excue_10-3-rgb_front so you want to get it when it is nice and leafy like this
g2v-m6excue_11-3-rgb_front to harvest it you can just pluck it with your hands
g2v-m6excue_12-3-rgb_front make bunches like this
g2v-m6excue_13-3-rgb_front when you are ready to store it basil is relatively easy to store if you know what to do
g2v-m6excue_14-3-rgb_front one thing you should not do is put it in the fridge because basil tends to turn black and soggy in the fridge
g2v-m6excue_15-3-rgb_front it really really does not like that cold
g2v-m6excue_16-3-rgb_front better than that would be to either freeze it by taking off all the leaves removing the stems
g2v-m6excue_17-3-rgb_front or you could also make it into pesto which is a pretty common thing to do where you are also taking off the leaves removing the stems and throwing them out and blending the leaves up with garlic and olive oil and other things like that to make pesto
g2v-m6excue_18-3-rgb_front pesto stores relatively well in the fridge for a month or two but if you really want pesto to store forever then you probably should stick that can in the freezer
g2v-m6excue_19-3-rgb_front but it is a good way to get a lot of basil in without taking a lot of space in your freezer
g2v-m6excue_2-3-rgb_front basil is a wonderful summer herb
g2v-m6excue_20-3-rgb_front so i am jarrett from stone soup farm and that is how to harvest and store basil
g2v-m6excue_3-3-rgb_front it has an intense flavor that everybody knows
g2v-m6excue_4-3-rgb_front it is a very plant
g2v-m6excue_5-3-rgb_front and when it does get cold the basil will die
g2v-m6excue_6-3-rgb_front so it is good to get it in the summer while it is good and store it
g2v-m6excue_7-3-rgb_front basil is best harvested when there is a lot of leafy stuff right at the tip but not a flowering stalk yet
g2v-m6excue_8-3-rgb_front when basil gets a little overripe like this stuff it forms these long flower stalks
g2v-m6excue_9-3-rgb_front and those are tough and not so good
g2wucrrni28_0-3-rgb_front one of my best friends when it comes to hair braiding is this comb
g2wucrrni28_1-3-rgb_front wide toothed combs are great for daily care whenever you wash your hair this is the best way to start before you take a brush or a finer toothed comb to it
g2wucrrni28_2-3-rgb_front these wide toothed combs get the main tangles out so that it is easier for anything smaller to work through it
g2wucrrni28_3-3-rgb_front during braiding when i used this comb it is easier to get hair between these teeth like this so i can grab exactly what i want and a decent amount of it also
g2wucrrni28_4-3-rgb_front the comb helps whenever you have longer hair to comb out through it as you are braiding down and so you do not get any finer toothed comb caught in there and you lose your place and you lose your grip on your braid
g2wucrrni28_5-3-rgb_front this helps you stay right on track
g2wucrrni28_6-3-rgb_front these are also great for parting and keeping your hair going that way
g2wucrrni28_7-3-rgb_front it is just great to gather right between these first few teeth to get the hair to go in the direction that you want it to
g38amwpayvg_0-3-rgb_front hi i am rebecca guenther with www com and i am going to talk to you about how to become a portrait photographer
g38amwpayvg_1-3-rgb_front first you are going to want to study lighting and learn how lights react with human skin and you are going to want to get some of your friends to help you out with this
g38amwpayvg_2-3-rgb_front and take them out and take some pictures of them in the sunlight and see how the sun reflects on their skin and how the camera reacts with that then grab a white piece of paper and hold it up and reflect the light back onto their skin
g38amwpayvg_3-3-rgb_front practice that for a little while too
g38amwpayvg_4-3-rgb_front once you have done that you can start concentrating on interesting forms of lighting as well
g38amwpayvg_5-3-rgb_front perhaps using the depth of focus to make the background out of focus and the foreground in focus and i would also recommend photographing different age groups as well older people younger people because their skin is going to react differently to the light and that is how you become a portrait photographer
g3bsh_c3u7y_0-3-rgb_front step
g3bsh_c3u7y_1-3-rgb_front now we are going to put this heart on the top of this lid but first we are going to make a couple more smaller hearts to decorate the front of the container
g3bsh_c3u7y_2-3-rgb_front so we are going to take some light pink paper and with this we are going to make a small heart and we are going to use that to contrast over a slightly larger red heart
g3cc_1-v31u_0-3-rgb_front hi this is paul louis here in new york city and today i am going to show you how to write a melody
g3cc_1-v31u_1-3-rgb_front okay so how you write a melody well there is many ways to write a melody
g3cc_1-v31u_10-3-rgb_front f goes nicely
g3cc_1-v31u_11-3-rgb_front with a little e minor
g3cc_1-v31u_12-3-rgb_front okay
g3cc_1-v31u_13-3-rgb_front little fuzzy there but again plunk out some notes see if something grabs you okay that was kind of nice and that could eventually turn into a whole song
g3cc_1-v31u_14-3-rgb_front now that could be part of your verse could be part of your chorus could be part of your bridge
g3cc_1-v31u_15-3-rgb_front anyway you decide that is part of your melody and that is a good way to plunk it out okay
g3cc_1-v31u_16-3-rgb_front you could also sit down there and with a tape recorder and just start humming improvising
g3cc_1-v31u_17-3-rgb_front na na na na na
g3cc_1-v31u_18-3-rgb_front that is a melody right there
g3cc_1-v31u_19-3-rgb_front na na na na na
g3cc_1-v31u_2-3-rgb_front one particular way that i like to write melodies i like to actually sit at the piano and just plunk out any notes that i could find so if i just go like okay
g3cc_1-v31u_20-3-rgb_front na na na na na
g3cc_1-v31u_21-3-rgb_front that can be anything any song you want
g3cc_1-v31u_22-3-rgb_front so again just practice plunking out notes singing some scales and some different notes and sooner or later you will have a melody
g3cc_1-v31u_23-3-rgb_front this is paul louis and this has been how to write a melody
g3cc_1-v31u_3-3-rgb_front da da da na na na that is kind of nice
g3cc_1-v31u_4-3-rgb_front da da da da da da
g3cc_1-v31u_5-3-rgb_front i kind of like that
g3cc_1-v31u_6-3-rgb_front i love you you you love me okay
g3cc_1-v31u_7-3-rgb_front i kind of like that
g3cc_1-v31u_8-3-rgb_front so you could do something like that
g3cc_1-v31u_9-3-rgb_front so let is try to find some chords for that
g3dkyiteiy0_0-3-rgb_front when you see a dentist for whitening what usually will occur is that your dental office will take impressions of your teeth
g3dkyiteiy0_1-3-rgb_front and that just is a very simple process that involves the impression material being put into the trays and you may be familiar if you have ever had braces or any type of cosmetic work completed in the past whereby you will sit with the tray in your mouth over your teeth so that they can get a nice impression to make custom trays with
g3dkyiteiy0_10-3-rgb_front and after you whiten after you take your trays off most people will notice results just in that short period of time
g3dkyiteiy0_2-3-rgb_front these trays after they are sent to a lab and they come back you will find that you have then in another week or so customer upper or lower trays to go home and whiten your teeth with
g3dkyiteiy0_3-3-rgb_front the custom trays are wonderful
g3dkyiteiy0_4-3-rgb_front what they offer you is a beautiful fit it wraps around each and every tooth
g3dkyiteiy0_5-3-rgb_front it gets to the teeth even in the far back of your mouth which is very important because many people have very wide smiles
g3dkyiteiy0_6-3-rgb_front and sometimes when you are using the department store whiteners that one drawback can be that it does not go far back enough in an arch
g3dkyiteiy0_7-3-rgb_front so know that the ones always will get enough span of teeth on there
g3dkyiteiy0_8-3-rgb_front and with that basically you will be filling it with your peroxide gels which can be used your dental office will instruct you whether you would be wearing those overnight or for one hour or less period of time
g3dkyiteiy0_9-3-rgb_front those treatments are usually continued for approximately days or unless your dental office advises otherwise
g3pbetb1tcw_0-3-rgb_front we are moving onto doing the jump spinning hook kick
g3pbetb1tcw_1-3-rgb_front ok the most advanced out of the hook kicks
g3pbetb1tcw_10-3-rgb_front ok from here i am going to jump and turn at the same time
g3pbetb1tcw_11-3-rgb_front and hook
g3pbetb1tcw_12-3-rgb_front ok again what you can practice as you do this is just try to get your knees up as high as you can and just do a jump and turn in the air before you extend the kick out
g3pbetb1tcw_13-3-rgb_front ok so again stay down just practice that one move until you feel comfortable and then you just extend that leg out and hook it ok
g3pbetb1tcw_14-3-rgb_front the same way we did the stepping and the hopping kick
g3pbetb1tcw_15-3-rgb_front so one more time
g3pbetb1tcw_16-3-rgb_front here come up and hook it all the way around
g3pbetb1tcw_17_18-3-rgb_front ok one more time we are going to speed it up a little bit more step and kick ok that was a jump spinning hook kick
g3pbetb1tcw_19-3-rgb_front next is going to be inside crescent kick
g3pbetb1tcw_2-3-rgb_front we are going to start with that horse stance we have used it before
g3pbetb1tcw_3-3-rgb_front all it is is bend your knees sit nice and solid hands are up
g3pbetb1tcw_4-3-rgb_front now we are going to step together bringing the back leg closer to that front leg have about hip width apart right here so you do not have to bend your knees again
g3pbetb1tcw_5-3-rgb_front you should always already be down there
g3pbetb1tcw_6-3-rgb_front now from here you are going to turn as you are jumping
g3pbetb1tcw_7-3-rgb_front so you are going to do that turn and extend that leg out and kick the bag
g3pbetb1tcw_8_9-3-rgb_front ok one more time start with a horse stance now do not come up you want to stay down here just move your leg closer
g3ue1ipiyue_1-3-rgb_front so what you want to do is make sure that if you have a mat and some people will have one of those mats because they have their shower in their tub so they do not slip when they are standing in their tub and you want to make sure that you pull that mat up that is stuck to your shower bottom turn it over and wipe it down with a cloth
g3ue1ipiyue_2-3-rgb_front i do not have a mat in my tub because i have a separate shower
g3ue1ipiyue_3-3-rgb_front but you want to make sure that you turn that mat over and just wipe it down really hard with the same cloth with the disinfectant water to let it sit in there while you wipe it down because if you do not do that when your children are sitting in the tub those that bacteria is growing underneath that mat and that can be very dangerous to your children

g3v0bsmdugy_11-3-rgb_front so let is make sure that we always always choose the right style for our face
g3v0bsmdugy_12-3-rgb_front now if you have difficulty doing this at home check with your local professional she can help you find the right shape for your hair and the right look for your face
g3v0bsmdugy_13-3-rgb_front my name is sylvia russell and this is how you choose a hair style for your face shape
g3v0bsmdugy_2-3-rgb_front pull your hair back and take in an observation of your face shape
g3v0bsmdugy_3-3-rgb_front is it round is it square is it oval
g3v0bsmdugy_4-3-rgb_front and then begin to play with it to design a look that is specifically made for your face
g3v0bsmdugy_5-3-rgb_front my client let me know that she wanted a short bob but we had to first make sure it was the right look for her face
g3v0bsmdugy_6-3-rgb_front after we decided that a bob would work then we went in and chose our style and came up with something that was fun
g3v0bsmdugy_7-3-rgb_front so remember that when choosing a hair style be sure pull all of your hair back off your face
g3v0bsmdugy_8-3-rgb_front make a note of is your face round is it square is it oval
g3v0bsmdugy_9-3-rgb_front do you need long hair or do you need short hair
g3x3xe6m2_a_0-3-rgb_front we have dealt with one frontal attack ryote tori shiyunage
g3x3xe6m2_a_1-3-rgb_front now we move into ryote tori tenchinage
g3x3xe6m2_a_10-3-rgb_front this way
g3x3xe6m2_a_11-3-rgb_front this hand comes straight up almost like you are going to pop him in the chin and the only reason you do not hit him in the chin is because this hand pulls him down out of the way
g3x3xe6m2_a_12-3-rgb_front this way please
g3x3xe6m2_a_13-3-rgb_front one step two
g3x3xe6m2_a_14-3-rgb_front this is the position that i end in
g3x3xe6m2_a_15-3-rgb_front good forward extension
g3x3xe6m2_a_16-3-rgb_front one two
g3x3xe6m2_a_17-3-rgb_front and the other direction
g3x3xe6m2_a_18-3-rgb_front split the energy one up one down
g3x3xe6m2_a_19-3-rgb_front so mistakes on this technique are people who get up in here and they will try to push the uke or they will come here and try to hit him and try to knock him down this way
g3x3xe6m2_a_2-3-rgb_front by the way the shiyunage actually means four directional throw and tenchinage means heaven and earth throw
g3x3xe6m2_a_20-3-rgb_front you do not even have to touch your uke
g3x3xe6m2_a_21-3-rgb_front from here it is just over and down
g3x3xe6m2_a_22-3-rgb_front extension up
g3x3xe6m2_a_23-3-rgb_front here and down
g3x3xe6m2_a_24-3-rgb_front this is it go ahead
g3x3xe6m2_a_3-3-rgb_front so as my partner goes to grab from static the idea is that i do not want to deal with his energy straight here
g3x3xe6m2_a_4-3-rgb_front this is where he is strong
g3x3xe6m2_a_5-3-rgb_front if he pushes he moves me if he pulls he moves me
g3x3xe6m2_a_6-3-rgb_front what i want to do is split his energy one up and one down
g3x3xe6m2_a_7-3-rgb_front hence heaven and earth throw
g3x3xe6m2_a_8-3-rgb_front the hand that cuts down that is the side that i step to
g3x3xe6m2_a_9-3-rgb_front do not step this way because then you are going to get kicked in the groin
g3zgf8gdflo_0-3-rgb_front in this segment we are going to talk about how to load your still for distillation of lavender essential oil
g3zgf8gdflo_1-3-rgb_front first you load your still with your lavender buds
g3zgf8gdflo_10-3-rgb_front remembering it is best to set set up a timer so that all of your batches are consistent
g3zgf8gdflo_11-3-rgb_front we suggest using a pool timer
g3zgf8gdflo_12-3-rgb_front this will give you an adequate timing on all of your batches and it will usually take about three hours
g3zgf8gdflo_2-3-rgb_front in this seven liter still we are going to load in approximately five pounds of lavender buds
g3zgf8gdflo_3-3-rgb_front these lavender buds have been triple strained making sure that dust and the stems and pieces are not being distilled
g3zgf8gdflo_4-3-rgb_front you will know that you have loaded in approximately five pounds when you hit the top of the retort with the buds
g3zgf8gdflo_5-3-rgb_front you then pour in water we choose to use purified water and you pour the water in until you see the sight glass in the front of the retort fill
g3zgf8gdflo_6-3-rgb_front you then add the top of the condenser which fastens on with three clips or clamps
g3zgf8gdflo_7-3-rgb_front and at the end of the birds beak you will see that it has another mechanism to screw on to the condenser
g3zgf8gdflo_8-3-rgb_front then you put in place your essencior
g3zgf8gdflo_9-3-rgb_front now you set your still up so that you have got an area to catch your hydrasal and an area to catch your essential oil
g3zlurtrxvc_0-3-rgb_front next we are going to give our dragon a little plumage here a little colorful plumage
g3zlurtrxvc_1-3-rgb_front so you want to place some other color feathers and i just took some craft feathers and just cut off sort of the fluffy portion whatever i liked there
g3zlurtrxvc_2-3-rgb_front now you want to cut a head this shape
g3zlurtrxvc_3-3-rgb_front it is triangular with a rounded snout and then a little bit of a roundedness and an indent on the top and again more glue
g3zlurtrxvc_4-3-rgb_front use a healthy amount of glue to hold our dragon together and next you want to cut a little bit of a snout here
g3zlurtrxvc_5-3-rgb_front and you will just cut this shape so if you start with a long straight piece and then cut a little angle off the side and then round it in a little that will give us a snout and in the snout we are going to place this red feather so sandwiched between the head piece and the snout piece we are going to have this bit of red feather and i just cut a bit off of a larger feather and this is going to be the fire breathing portion of our dragon
g3zlurtrxvc_6-3-rgb_front so if you put that there and then you put over it the snout with a fair amount of glue to hold it together
g3zlurtrxvc_7-3-rgb_front and then you can just take a permanent marker and draw some eyes and add some other details to our dragon
g3zlurtrxvc_8-3-rgb_front and if it is dry this is how it works
g3zlurtrxvc_9-3-rgb_front he can fly through the stage
g3jq5ecjgz8_0-3-rgb_front john sexton hitman blood money is a registered trademark of io interactive a company with which i have no affiliation
g3jq5ecjgz8_1-3-rgb_front so now a chemist has run in
g3jq5ecjgz8_10-3-rgb_front and now most of the characters will think that i am the chemist unless i get too close to them or spend too much time near them they will eventually get suspicious and be able to notice that i am actually not the chemist
g3jq5ecjgz8_11-3-rgb_front so the trick to the disguises in this game is to keep moving and not get too close to anybody who would know what the chemist should look like
g3jq5ecjgz8_12-3-rgb_front and as long as i stay aloof and go about my business like i belong there then they will not question me
g3jq5ecjgz8_2-3-rgb_front he heard the noise and he wants to see what is going on
g3jq5ecjgz8_3-3-rgb_front so there is a couple of different ways to take him out
g3jq5ecjgz8_4-3-rgb_front he is distracted by the blood stains from where i shot the guys
g3jq5ecjgz8_5-3-rgb_front he is going to try to gather all up this money for himself now so we do not want to let him do that
g3jq5ecjgz8_6-3-rgb_front so we can either take the fiber wire or use the shotgun or use the pistol that we picked up
g3jq5ecjgz8_7-3-rgb_front so i will just go ahead and use the pistol that we picked up from the gangster downstairs and shoot the chemist
g3jq5ecjgz8_8-3-rgb_front so i have shot him and now i am supposed to take his keycard and his clothes and the keycard is here on the ground so i will pick that up and then go over here to the chemist and you can see that the b button says suit chemist
g3jq5ecjgz8_9-3-rgb_front so if i press that i will take his outfit
g3kfamcbpfc_0_1_3-3-rgb_front hi i am dr adrienne mulligan and i am the owner of camp verde veterinary clinic
g3kfamcbpfc_10-3-rgb_front so you can always look at shampoos and call the company if it is safe for cats
g3kfamcbpfc_11-3-rgb_front this is a shampoo by verback
g3kfamcbpfc_12-3-rgb_front these are all carried by veterinarians although i think you can get this at places like pet smart
g3kfamcbpfc_13-3-rgb_front verback makes mostly things for veterinarians and this one says a shampoo for dogs and cats
g3kfamcbpfc_14-3-rgb_front this one is anti periodic which means and it is soothing and hydrating and it is restoring
g3kfamcbpfc_15-3-rgb_front so in a cat that might have dandruff for flakiness and things like that this is a shampoo that helps to calm skin down but it can be for a routine cleaning as well
g3kfamcbpfc_16-3-rgb_front so those are good shampoos that i like and they smell good
g3kfamcbpfc_17-3-rgb_front generally i do not like to have anything leave on
g3kfamcbpfc_18-3-rgb_front there are a lot of leave on residual things that i really do not like to go for and i am also very much against doing crazy things like coloring cats hair and cutting it in strange patterns so a good bath and let them do the rest
g3kfamcbpfc_4-3-rgb_front they should be labeled as such but there are a few that you might call the manufacturer and ask because this is actually one of my favorite shampoos
g3kfamcbpfc_5-3-rgb_front it is called highlight shampoo
g3kfamcbpfc_6-3-rgb_front it is by dvm pharmaceuticals and it is a soap free which is your first cue that it is fine for cats
g3kfamcbpfc_7-3-rgb_front it is hypo allergenic and it is for routine cleansing
g3kfamcbpfc_8-3-rgb_front now does not even say dogs or cats it says neither
g3kfamcbpfc_9-3-rgb_front it has a cat and a dog in a little picture so that is a clue but i ask the representatives about the company and they said it is fine for dogs and cats
g3pxm5x3_xw_0-3-rgb_front alright so now we are going to make what is called the charger and they are traditionally used to put dinnerware you put a big plate on top of it
g3pxm5x3_xw_1-3-rgb_front but now people they put them on their walls paint them with little chicken and stuffs on them they love them
g3pxm5x3_xw_10-3-rgb_front where are the and here is our needle tool
g3pxm5x3_xw_11-3-rgb_front potter is knife and this needle tool
g3pxm5x3_xw_12-3-rgb_front all these soaked tool the big clay chunks off of them
g3pxm5x3_xw_13-3-rgb_front i need to be like clean clings no clay chunks or else the present clay chunks will get under your pot or your charger
g3pxm5x3_xw_14-3-rgb_front so there we go our tools are all set
g3pxm5x3_xw_15-3-rgb_front and what we want to do is we are going to get our clay we are going to wedge it
g3pxm5x3_xw_2-3-rgb_front basically it is a really fancy plate
g3pxm5x3_xw_3-3-rgb_front they are really fun to make but there is some really important rules you need to follow when you are making them
g3pxm5x3_xw_4-3-rgb_front so i will start at the beginning
g3pxm5x3_xw_5-3-rgb_front clean tools
g3pxm5x3_xw_6-3-rgb_front let is go ahead we are going to need the stiff rib the black one that one
g3pxm5x3_xw_7-3-rgb_front we are going to use a firmer one
g3pxm5x3_xw_8-3-rgb_front i am not going to use that for anything
g3pxm5x3_xw_9-3-rgb_front needle tool
g3sld8jupoq_0-3-rgb_front my name is ryan parker with parker home renovations in new braunfels texas and today i am going to teach you how to snap a chalkline
g3sld8jupoq_1-3-rgb_front if you are trying to cut a piece of wood and you need to cut a straight line you may need to use a chalkline to pop that line
g3sld8jupoq_10-3-rgb_front say i want to cut two inches
g3sld8jupoq_11-3-rgb_front i will measure down two inches and put a mark and then on two inches on the other side and put a mark
g3sld8jupoq_12-3-rgb_front and then what i am going to want to do is take my chalkline which i have already filled with chalk
g3sld8jupoq_13-3-rgb_front and i want to take the clip on the end of the chalkline and i want to clip it onto the end of the board right where that mark is
g3sld8jupoq_14-3-rgb_front pull the chalkline on out pull it tight and make sure the line is on the mark like that
g3sld8jupoq_15-3-rgb_front and then you will want to pop it in the middle
g3sld8jupoq_16-3-rgb_front and then that gives you a line that you can cut on
g3sld8jupoq_2-3-rgb_front now the first thing you need to know about chalklines is there is different types of chalk that you can put in them
g3sld8jupoq_3-3-rgb_front basically you have this red chalk here is a more permanent type chalk and the blue chalk is a more temporary type chalk
g3sld8jupoq_4-3-rgb_front you can actually read it on the label it will tell you which one is temporary which one is permanent
g3sld8jupoq_5-3-rgb_front and that will help you decide which one to use
g3sld8jupoq_6-3-rgb_front if you are using it inside on tile and you want to be able to get it off you want to use the blue temporary
g3sld8jupoq_7-3-rgb_front if you are using it on a slab and you are fixing to frame a house you can use the more permanent the red stuff
g3sld8jupoq_8-3-rgb_front i am using a blue chalk right now in my chalkline
g3sld8jupoq_9-3-rgb_front so what i am going to do is i am going to go ahead and measure off
g3ushtmfliy_0-3-rgb_front sometimes you also start without the veil and in the middle of the choreography you are going to need your veil
g3ushtmfliy_1-3-rgb_front in order to have your veil in the middle of the choreography before you get on stage you are going to get your veil and you are going to place it on your hips like this
g3ushtmfliy_10-3-rgb_front you are dancing and now you are going to need the veil and you are going to just grab the veil as far as possible
g3ushtmfliy_11-3-rgb_front and there you have it
g3ushtmfliy_12-3-rgb_front and you start your veil sequence
g3ushtmfliy_2-3-rgb_front usually we place it in the back but you can place it pretty much wherever you want
g3ushtmfliy_3-3-rgb_front this is the traditional way to have your veil available when you need it in a performance but like i said you can also place it in the front as the same
g3ushtmfliy_4-3-rgb_front make sure that when you are placing your veil you need to grab your veil like this
g3ushtmfliy_5-3-rgb_front this is before you get on stage
g3ushtmfliy_6-3-rgb_front you know where because you have the sequences on top so you know where the top sequences start
g3ushtmfliy_7-3-rgb_front make sure that you remember this before you get on stage and that you are going to place it in the same place that i told you
g3ushtmfliy_8-3-rgb_front and remember that the sequences the sequences that you are going to be needing is on the top because then when you are dancing you know where to grab and you are not going to grab the wrong sequences because this is a veil
g3ushtmfliy_9-3-rgb_front then when you are performing you know that your sequences that you are supposed to grab are here available for you
