-d5dn54th2e_0-1-rgb_front we are going to work on a arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you
-d5dn54th2e_1-1-rgb_front i call it painting the wall
-d5dn54th2e_10-1-rgb_front so we are going to go up and down let is switch hands down and up down and up
-d5dn54th2e_11-1-rgb_front and just let those fingers relax
-d5dn54th2e_12-1-rgb_front now together you are going to go opposite
-d5dn54th2e_13-1-rgb_front do it very mechanically at first and then slowly soften it out as you feel comfortable
-d5dn54th2e_14-1-rgb_front it is real easy to actually get your fingers to lead so try not to let them do that
-d5dn54th2e_15-1-rgb_front let the wrist do all the leading
-d5dn54th2e_2-1-rgb_front so this one what you are going to start with let is take one hand first it is going to the wrist is going to come down and the wrist is going to come up
-d5dn54th2e_3-1-rgb_front so basically your wrist is going to be leading the movement and let the fingers follow nice and relaxed where the wrist is going
-d5dn54th2e_4-1-rgb_front do not let the fingers take over let the wrist do all the guiding
-d5dn54th2e_5-1-rgb_front let is make sure that are feet are parallel and are knees are soft
-d5dn54th2e_6-1-rgb_front our belly buttons pulled in pressing in towards our spine and our chest is lifted and our arms are relaxed are shoulders are nice and relaxed
-d5dn54th2e_7-1-rgb_front so let is start with the one hand going up and down
-d5dn54th2e_8-1-rgb_front we are going to keep this right in front of us you do not want to have it in front of your face so you block yourself
-d5dn54th2e_9-1-rgb_front you want it right in front of your solar plexus
-f1_kdl050s_0-1-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise
-f1_kdl050s_1-1-rgb_front the number one loss for these birds is flight
-f1_kdl050s_10-1-rgb_front you need to be very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flighted
-f1_kdl050s_11-1-rgb_front it seems to be the number one way to loose them
-f1_kdl050s_12-1-rgb_front once they get loose outside predators will get to them very quickly
-f1_kdl050s_13-1-rgb_front these guys are not suited to live in the united states they are not native here and they do not survive
-f1_kdl050s_14-1-rgb_front the other dangers you need to worry about is teflon pans
-f1_kdl050s_15-1-rgb_front if they are heated to a high temperature they give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them basically to fell off their perch dead
-f1_kdl050s_16-1-rgb_front there is nothing that you can do about it and it is very quickly
-f1_kdl050s_17-1-rgb_front it is kind of a silent killer
-f1_kdl050s_18-1-rgb_front so if you have them in the kitchen and if you are going to cook with teflon move them to another room in the house so that you can protect them
-f1_kdl050s_19-1-rgb_front aerosols spraying for bugs spraying perfumes around the house all those sort of things these birds have very very sensitive upper repository tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol it can irritate their lungs
-f1_kdl050s_2-1-rgb_front if these guys are flighted you need to be really careful if you have them loose in your household
-f1_kdl050s_20-1-rgb_front and these guys only have a few breaths before they will die
-f1_kdl050s_21-1-rgb_front so you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house
-f1_kdl050s_22-1-rgb_front and lastly they are so so tiny basically anything in your house a dog a cat anything they can get squished in a door if they get mouthed even a little tiny bit by your dog or cat or by your kid they will just squished
-f1_kdl050s_23-1-rgb_front there is not a whole lot to them they are not that robust they are mostly feathers
-f1_kdl050s_24-1-rgb_front you have to be fairly careful with these birds
-f1_kdl050s_25-1-rgb_front at least in a physical way
-f1_kdl050s_26-1-rgb_front those are most of your household dangers
-f1_kdl050s_27-1-rgb_front and again if you are cooking and the birds are loose be careful with them landing on a hot pan
-f1_kdl050s_28-1-rgb_front you do not want toilet seats open if they are flying around your house because they can fly in it and drowned
-f1_kdl050s_29-1-rgb_front just be careful you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage you basically bombproof your house
-f1_kdl050s_3-1-rgb_front a lot of these birds are not tame
-f1_kdl050s_30-1-rgb_front you make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked at for
-f1_kdl050s_31-1-rgb_front and if they are alone in their cages and if you have smaller pets and it is a smaller cage they cannot knock their cage over and let either the bird to fly out or they can not reach through the bars
-f1_kdl050s_32-1-rgb_front like a cat might dig through the bars if they are small enough and be able to grab hold of the bird
-f1_kdl050s_33-1-rgb_front and if the bird is outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine raccoons have been known to break into their cages and tear through the bars and ripped into these guys
-f1_kdl050s_34-1-rgb_front so you have to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time
-f1_kdl050s_35-1-rgb_front that more or less covers it just be careful because your birds are very small and much more sensitive to chemicals then many other pets are
-f1_kdl050s_4-1-rgb_front people get them and they only have two or three of them
-f1_kdl050s_5-1-rgb_front as you are opening the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away
-f1_kdl050s_6-1-rgb_front and when they panic they fly and they do not come back
-f1_kdl050s_7-1-rgb_front they fly out your windows
-f1_kdl050s_8-1-rgb_front they fly out your front door
-f1_kdl050s_9-1-rgb_front you will be thinking that every thing is sealed and you go clean the papers and your daughter son husband walks in through the front door and that bird just flies right out
00dwj4yrrsi_0_1-1-rgb_front i hope this becomes very popular here of late is the circle hooks now circle hooks has been used by japanese fishermen and longliners for years and years but in recent years they have developed lighter smaller in shore type hooks which are very well suited particularly to folks that are in to the hook and release type fishing
00dwj4yrrsi_2-1-rgb_front this hook basically is designed to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth
00dwj4yrrsi_3-1-rgb_front now this type of hook when you get a bite you can not jerk the rod to set the hook
00dwj4yrrsi_4-1-rgb_front you basically just reel down and get the line tight and the fish will take off and when he does he usually turns and this hook comes right in the corner of his mouth and it sort of acts really like a kind of like a bottle opener
00dwj4yrrsi_5-1-rgb_front once you get it in there it is very difficult to remove this hook so if you catch a lot of fish when you hook up the fish you rarely ever lose them because of that particular mechanism
00dwj4yrrsi_6-1-rgb_front the nice thing about the circle hook is you do not gut hook a lot of fish
00dwj4yrrsi_7-1-rgb_front you do not damage a lot of fish
00dwj4yrrsi_8-1-rgb_front you simply get him up to the boat
00dwj4yrrsi_9-1-rgb_front if you want to release him you can release him or cut the hook out and it is a pretty it is a pretty friendly hook for fishing
0ogfy530aui_0-1-rgb_front michael rosengart thrusters
0ogfy530aui_1-1-rgb_front right now we are going to get into a more complicated exercise
0ogfy530aui_10-1-rgb_front jonesy is going to sit back
0ogfy530aui_11-1-rgb_front and as he drives up again driving on his heel driving his hips forward is the work from his hips that will then force the arms up
0ogfy530aui_12-1-rgb_front good
0ogfy530aui_13-1-rgb_front and then there is a lot of arm strength involved to stabilize the dumbbell right above his shoulders
0ogfy530aui_14-1-rgb_front not out to the side not back but right above
0ogfy530aui_15-1-rgb_front that is good
0ogfy530aui_16-1-rgb_front good work jonesy
0ogfy530aui_17-1-rgb_front again working from the heels up work with your breath feel that you are driving your hips forward and up each time good work
0ogfy530aui_18-1-rgb_front do ten of those and we are going to take a three to five minute break and then come back to it
0ogfy530aui_19-1-rgb_front again i want to make sure that you understand that when you are doing the thruster that it is working from the ground up and it is one smooth movement
0ogfy530aui_2-1-rgb_front we are integrating more of the body
0ogfy530aui_20-1-rgb_front it is not segmented
0ogfy530aui_21-1-rgb_front it is not the squat and a shoulder press okay
0ogfy530aui_22-1-rgb_front it is one smooth movement
0ogfy530aui_23-1-rgb_front try it
0ogfy530aui_3-1-rgb_front and we are going to develop more strength because we are getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in cohesion
0ogfy530aui_4-1-rgb_front okay
0ogfy530aui_5-1-rgb_front so jonesy you want to go ahead and show what a thruster is
0ogfy530aui_6-1-rgb_front jonesy going to take a couple of dumbbells bring it up to his shoulders
0ogfy530aui_7-1-rgb_front and we are basically he is going to sit back into a squat
0ogfy530aui_8-1-rgb_front and we are basically combining a squat and a shoulder press but it is not that simple
0ogfy530aui_9-1-rgb_front it is not segmented like that
0pkzg0rruz4_0-1-rgb_front another technique is you can braid the hair on first and then start wrapping cause some people have really short hair and we can create the look with adding the hair end
0pkzg0rruz4_0-2-rgb_front another technique is you can braid the hair on first and then start wrapping cause some people have really short hair and we can create the look with adding the hair end
0pkzg0rruz4_1-1-rgb_front so no matter what the length of your hair long as it is long enough to add a at the hair on we can start by braiding it on then braid then wrap and you can make this as thick as you like whatever size you like whatever color you like
0pkzg0rruz4_1-2-rgb_front so no matter what the length of your hair long as it is long enough to add a at the hair on we can start by braiding it on then braid then wrap and you can make this as thick as you like whatever size you like whatever color you like
0pkzg0rruz4_2-1-rgb_front i like the lock extensions because it is not damaging to your hair at all because you can add color without actually coloring your hair you just wrap on a different color
0pkzg0rruz4_2-2-rgb_front i like the lock extensions because it is not damaging to your hair at all because you can add color without actually coloring your hair you just wrap on a different color
0pkzg0rruz4_3-1-rgb_front i really like that
0pkzg0rruz4_3-2-rgb_front i really like that
0pkzg0rruz4_4-1-rgb_front you can get instant length which i love
0pkzg0rruz4_4-2-rgb_front you can get instant length which i love
0pkzg0rruz4_5-1-rgb_front and we have a skinny one and we have a little fatter one
0pkzg0rruz4_5-2-rgb_front and we have a skinny one and we have a little fatter one
0pkzg0rruz4_6-1-rgb_front and we can them even fatter
0pkzg0rruz4_6-2-rgb_front and we can them even fatter
0pkzg0rruz4_7-1-rgb_front whatever length we can just keep on adding hair forever and ever and it will just go on and on
0pkzg0rruz4_7-2-rgb_front whatever length we can just keep on adding hair forever and ever and it will just go on and on
0pkzg0rruz4_8-1-rgb_front we can make them as long as we want
0pkzg0rruz4_8-2-rgb_front we can make them as long as we want
0zvsqf23tmw_1-1-rgb_front and in this segment i am going to just start paint in the background color
0zvsqf23tmw_1-2-rgb_front and in this segment i am going to just start paint in the background color
0zvsqf23tmw_10-1-rgb_front i am going to start on the edge so i can get the edge painted in against the skyline
0zvsqf23tmw_10-2-rgb_front i am going to start on the edge so i can get the edge painted in against the skyline
0zvsqf23tmw_11-1-rgb_front i am just doing a dark hill here
0zvsqf23tmw_11-2-rgb_front i am just doing a dark hill here
0zvsqf23tmw_12-1-rgb_front i am trying to define the edges and then kinda just it to fill it in a little bit
0zvsqf23tmw_12-2-rgb_front i am trying to define the edges and then kinda just it to fill it in a little bit
0zvsqf23tmw_13-1-rgb_front i do not want too much paint on the wall
0zvsqf23tmw_13-2-rgb_front i do not want too much paint on the wall
0zvsqf23tmw_14-1-rgb_front and you really do not need to use a lot of paint
0zvsqf23tmw_14-2-rgb_front and you really do not need to use a lot of paint
0zvsqf23tmw_15-1-rgb_front you do not need a lot of paint on your brush
0zvsqf23tmw_15-2-rgb_front you do not need a lot of paint on your brush
0zvsqf23tmw_16-1-rgb_front you want to just kinda take it easy and then use more paint as you start filling in your details
0zvsqf23tmw_16-2-rgb_front you want to just kinda take it easy and then use more paint as you start filling in your details
0zvsqf23tmw_17-1-rgb_front so right now we are just kinda put a tiny bit of paint on there
0zvsqf23tmw_17-2-rgb_front so right now we are just kinda put a tiny bit of paint on there
0zvsqf23tmw_18-1-rgb_front and this entire mural is going to kinda fade in to the wall
0zvsqf23tmw_18-2-rgb_front and this entire mural is going to kinda fade in to the wall
0zvsqf23tmw_19-1-rgb_front it is not going to be a mural so i just want to make sure that i use less paint the farther out that i go
0zvsqf23tmw_19-2-rgb_front it is not going to be a mural so i just want to make sure that i use less paint the farther out that i go
0zvsqf23tmw_2-1-rgb_front and when you do a children is wall mural you probably most likely want to always start with like your sky first
0zvsqf23tmw_2-2-rgb_front and when you do a children is wall mural you probably most likely want to always start with like your sky first
0zvsqf23tmw_3-1-rgb_front you want to do your background before you get all your objects and those should always be last
0zvsqf23tmw_3-2-rgb_front you want to do your background before you get all your objects and those should always be last
0zvsqf23tmw_4-1-rgb_front so what i have got here is i have got a little bit of benjamin moore acrylic paint and i have got it in is a flat paint
0zvsqf23tmw_4-2-rgb_front so what i have got here is i have got a little bit of benjamin moore acrylic paint and i have got it in is a flat paint
0zvsqf23tmw_5-1-rgb_front and i have also got a cheap brush and i am just going to kinda it a little bit onto the wall
0zvsqf23tmw_5-2-rgb_front and i have also got a cheap brush and i am just going to kinda it a little bit onto the wall

0zvsqf23tmw_8-1-rgb_front and if i need to mix it down a little bit then i can always use a little bit of medium or a little bit of water to dilute it
0zvsqf23tmw_8-2-rgb_front and if i need to mix it down a little bit then i can always use a little bit of medium or a little bit of water to dilute it
0zvsqf23tmw_9-1-rgb_front and i will just keep painting on here
0zvsqf23tmw_9-2-rgb_front and i will just keep painting on here
1-xk5utdsme_0-2-rgb_front we are going to look at it from several aspects and the first thing that i would want to speak to would be the owner of the business the ceo and in my profession and i work for a company that provides wellness programs
1-xk5utdsme_1-2-rgb_front we have been doing this for a number of years and have been quite successful at producing results
1-xk5utdsme_10-2-rgb_front another one would be eating a proper diet
1-xk5utdsme_11-2-rgb_front and you know when we got to that i said you know it is not just eating the right foods but it is also eliminating some of the bad foods
1-xk5utdsme_12-2-rgb_front and i said you know like ice cream ice cream is great but if you eat ice cream all the time it is got so much sugar in it it is really going have an effect and the president said whoa you can not go there that is my favorite food
1-xk5utdsme_13-2-rgb_front and so then i said well maybe soda would be something that you would start with as
1-xk5utdsme_14-2-rgb_front and he said whoa wait the vice president said we can not go there because you know because he is addicted to soda
1-xk5utdsme_15-2-rgb_front and so the net after our presentation i called back and i was not getting any callbacks
1-xk5utdsme_16-2-rgb_front we want a wellness program but we really do not want to lead
1-xk5utdsme_17-2-rgb_front but when you think about that is that going to get the job done for you
1-xk5utdsme_18-2-rgb_front so i speak to you mr ceo mr corporate owner mr corporate president you that are trying to produce something positive in your company you need to pay attention to your own health
1-xk5utdsme_19-2-rgb_front think about it if you have a heart attack if you are hit with cancer what is that going to do to your organization
1-xk5utdsme_2-2-rgb_front and so the real key to it is you mr ceo you mr owner of the business and why would that be
1-xk5utdsme_3-2-rgb_front well if you are not healthy can you have a healthy organization
1-xk5utdsme_4-2-rgb_front if you are not setting the example if you are not being the leader then who is going to lead
1-xk5utdsme_5-2-rgb_front i have spoken with several different companies and i can remember one particular bank president in his senior vice president we sat down together and we started to talk about the subject of because he wanted a wellness program that is why i was there
1-xk5utdsme_6-2-rgb_front and so we started talking about it and i said to him well you know there are certain things that are required to have a really a healthy group of employees
1-xk5utdsme_7-2-rgb_front and i said well one of them would be exercise
1-xk5utdsme_8-2-rgb_front you are going to have to have someway of getting your employees involved with regular exercise
1-xk5utdsme_9-2-rgb_front another one is drinking water we are going to get into these in a little more detail
11jt4jrni-o_0-2-rgb_front let is go to the squat position now and add the tubing into that
11jt4jrni-o_1-2-rgb_front again so many variations
11jt4jrni-o_10-2-rgb_front the key on this one and something to keep in mind on this position is this
11jt4jrni-o_11-2-rgb_front if you are tubing is really tight you might not be able to get up unless your legs are close together
11jt4jrni-o_12-2-rgb_front a squat position close together does not work very well
11jt4jrni-o_13-2-rgb_front so the key on something like this is that your tubing what you have purchased or what you have has enough flexibility that when you stand on it you can really stand wide
11jt4jrni-o_14-2-rgb_front but it is definitely a great exercise and i highly recommend it
11jt4jrni-o_2-2-rgb_front i am going to show you something simple and basic
11jt4jrni-o_3-2-rgb_front i have got my feet about shoulder width apart pretty much have to to do a descent squat
11jt4jrni-o_4-2-rgb_front i am going to take my tubing up and i am going to open up my palms so they are facing forward
11jt4jrni-o_5-2-rgb_front what am i doing with this
11jt4jrni-o_6-2-rgb_front as i go down and up in a squat position i have to resist the tubing right
11jt4jrni-o_7-2-rgb_front it is trying to keep me from coming up
11jt4jrni-o_8-2-rgb_front as i stretch the tubing straight up and down it makes the squat harder
11jt4jrni-o_9-2-rgb_front once again you do not want to bend forward too much on this
1g8liwgklme_0-2-rgb_front to begin your dotted nail art you are going to need to use a stylus also known as a dotter
1g8liwgklme_1-2-rgb_front a stylus comes with different size rounded ends on it anywhere ranging from very small to very large
1g8liwgklme_2-2-rgb_front there is also sizes in between depending on the design you are wanting to do
1g8liwgklme_3-2-rgb_front for a very small intricate design like an i you are going to want to use the smallest size that you have where as if you are wanting to do something large such as the sun you are going to want to use the largest end that you have
1g8liwgklme_4-2-rgb_front there is also sizes if you wanted to do things like buttons or just small designs like that
1g8liwgklme_5-2-rgb_front for your polish color you are going to want to use a polish that is either complimentary or contrasting
1g8liwgklme_6-2-rgb_front i prefer contrasting just so that the design actually sticks out and stands better and so that it is more easily available to be seen
1qmgk8f5jny_0-1-rgb_front hello my names rebecca herrick i am a licensed massage therapist in wilmington north carolina and i am here to give my review on massage parlors
1qmgk8f5jny_1-1-rgb_front first of all massage parlor is a very dated term and often has some negative connotations that are associated with it and as a massage therapist we worked hard to kind of steer away from that and you know work hard to get the respect that the therapeutic aspect of massage therapy deserves
1qmgk8f5jny_2-1-rgb_front so having said that when you are looking for a place to have a massage you can call it a massage therapy center or a wellness center something of that nature and when you are doing so you want to always make sure that you check the background of the location and also of the therapist practicing there
1qmgk8f5jny_3-1-rgb_front you always want to make sure that you get the highest quality care by receiving massage from the most educated and absolutely licensed therapist
1qmgk8f5jny_4-1-rgb_front you can check with local networks newspapers other massage therapists in the area for reviews on massage therapy centers in your area and that would be my take on massage parlor reviews
1v-aog8wct4_10-1-rgb_front now lets not forget your charity or event website
1v-aog8wct4_11-1-rgb_front this is a great place to promote your sponsors as well
1v-aog8wct4_12-1-rgb_front you can do this through banners links to their website or actual ads on your site promoting the sponsor
1v-aog8wct4_13-1-rgb_front finally i hope you are going to hand out lots and lots of flyers
1v-aog8wct4_14-1-rgb_front a flyer is a great way to promote the sponsor
1v-aog8wct4_15-1-rgb_front again depending on the level they might just get their website listed
1v-aog8wct4_16-1-rgb_front if it is a large sponsor they can have their logo or their full ad
1v-aog8wct4_17-1-rgb_front the more colorful and bright the flyer the better
1v-aog8wct4_18-1-rgb_front remember sponsors are looking for potential customers promotion and publicity
1v-aog8wct4_19-1-rgb_front also remember a happy sponsor is sure to come back year after year after year
1v-aog8wct4_2-1-rgb_front how can i create great sponsorships for my golf tournament you cry
1v-aog8wct4_3-1-rgb_front well no worries because that is exactly what this segment is about
1v-aog8wct4_4-1-rgb_front let is take a look at some of the perks you can offer potential sponsors
1v-aog8wct4_5-1-rgb_front to begin with you can utilize your very own golf program that you are going to be printing
1v-aog8wct4_6-1-rgb_front now depending on the size of the sponsorship you can offer quarter page half page or ads
1v-aog8wct4_7-1-rgb_front title sponsors might get advertisement on the front the back cover of the actual program
1v-aog8wct4_8-1-rgb_front another great perk offer a vendor table at the event
1v-aog8wct4_9-1-rgb_front companies will love the idea that they get to interact with the actual golfers at the event
1ajwx9nrlmk_0-2-rgb_front elizabeth rose the next thing we are going to do is bring some movement into this area with all the tension where your headache is happening
1ajwx9nrlmk_1-2-rgb_front so i am going to put my hair back so that you guys can see it it is a little bit easier
1ajwx9nrlmk_10-2-rgb_front again when you are here the shoulders are not creeping up
1ajwx9nrlmk_11-2-rgb_front they are still melting down on either side of the spine
1ajwx9nrlmk_12-2-rgb_front you are going to inhale think of breathing into the back of the neck and between the shoulder blades and exhale
1ajwx9nrlmk_13-2-rgb_front stick with your breath into the belly into the ribcage and then into the heart
1ajwx9nrlmk_14-2-rgb_front then as you inhale you are going to let the left ear come over toward the left shoulder
1ajwx9nrlmk_15-2-rgb_front notice again the right shoulder is not going to pop up and the left shoulder is not going to come up to support the ear in your chest
1ajwx9nrlmk_16-2-rgb_front just keep then gently falling down
1ajwx9nrlmk_17-2-rgb_front so inhale and lift your ear up and you are going to breathe here
1ajwx9nrlmk_18-2-rgb_front now slowly begin to connect these movements exhaling as you drop the chin toward the chest and inhaling as the ear rolls up towards the shoulder blades and do this as long as you are comfortable
1ajwx9nrlmk_19-2-rgb_front i would say at least repetitions
1ajwx9nrlmk_2-2-rgb_front all that is going to happen is you are going to be seated in your easy seated pose again with your sits bone on the floor or on a block
1ajwx9nrlmk_20-2-rgb_front if you can keep it going for a minute that is great but stick with the breath
1ajwx9nrlmk_21-2-rgb_front let the breath be the emphasis for every movement and do not ever let yourself give the breath away
1ajwx9nrlmk_3-2-rgb_front you are going to inhale and the crown of the head reaches up so that you are sitting tall but you are not going to be propped this way
1ajwx9nrlmk_4-2-rgb_front if you are sitting this way then just relax so that your shoulder blades fall down on either side of the spine but the crown of your head is still reaching up
1ajwx9nrlmk_5-2-rgb_front you are going to inhale and then as you exhale just gently drop the right ear toward the right shoulder
1ajwx9nrlmk_6-2-rgb_front notice how my shoulders do not creep like i drop the ear down right
1ajwx9nrlmk_7-2-rgb_front they are going to stay exactly where they are and feeling my shoulder blades melting down on either side of the spine and i am exhaling to just drop my right ear toward the right shoulder
1ajwx9nrlmk_8-2-rgb_front take a couple breaths here inhaling and exhaling and then in and out through the nose remember
1ajwx9nrlmk_9-2-rgb_front and then on an exhale you are going to go ahead and let the chin fall toward the chest
204p_khhwks_0-2-rgb_front now i have been applying product to both eyes and i am finishing out the top of the left side of her eye
204p_khhwks_11-2-rgb_front open relax and open those eyes
204p_khhwks_12-2-rgb_front then i look for even and these are beautifully evenly done
204p_khhwks_13-2-rgb_front then what i would do is get ice packs out and before i even start the bottoms just to relieve any kind of swelling and for comfort i would ice pack her eyes and let her relax and take five minutes while i set up for the step two to the bottom eyes
279mo2nwc_e_1-2-rgb_front in this section we are going to talk about full body movement
279mo2nwc_e_10-2-rgb_front so you really want to make sure that you do that full body movement throughout your whole entire body especially as a cross country runner
279mo2nwc_e_2-2-rgb_front so what i mean by full body movement is from your upper body down to your lower body
279mo2nwc_e_3-2-rgb_front your upper body you do not want to be timid or shy i know it is going to feel a little silly if you do not really move your arms but you should really be moving your arms
279mo2nwc_e_4-2-rgb_front and the reason you will see is that arm movement a lot especially when the intensity increases and let is say you come to that hill you really want to make sure you move your arms because you are now circulating a lot of blood flow evenly throughout your body and you are getting more oxygen into your lungs and you are breathing in that fresh air and blowing it back out with full body movement
279mo2nwc_e_5-2-rgb_front now as far as your lower body your legs you want to make sure that you put most of the weight down your calves
279mo2nwc_e_6-2-rgb_front so you see if i was running as i am running i am putting most of the weight on my calves and i am moving my body and i am moving my arms and my shoulders
279mo2nwc_e_7-2-rgb_front and breathing in through the nose and breathing out through the mouth
279mo2nwc_e_8-2-rgb_front and will you notice the difference the next time you run just remember in your mind what i said
279mo2nwc_e_9-2-rgb_front the more that you move your arms you are going to see yourself increasing in speed and you are going to see the increase in oxygen level compared to just standing there which does very little movement
2snvww3mob4_1-2-rgb_front we are talking about what hairstyles suit a diamond shape face
2snvww3mob4_2-2-rgb_front you want to reduce the width at the sides so you want to go with a bob something short
2snvww3mob4_3-2-rgb_front probably a little bit shorter then this but something like this would be good
2snvww3mob4_4-2-rgb_front diamond shape faces need a narrow side and at the chin so if it came down to the chin that would be really good it would complete your look
2snvww3mob4_5-2-rgb_front avoid wearing height on top or volume on the sides
2snvww3mob4_6-2-rgb_front you can use a bang to cover a narrow forehead or something like this would be really great right about here like this really helps change the shape of the face and give you a better look throughout
2ri5hym48ma_0-2-rgb_front rebecca sato hi
2ri5hym48ma_10-2-rgb_front so what they do is they pick someone for each character that they think kind of embodies that character someone who realizes that they know but that they do not know too well
2ri5hym48ma_11-2-rgb_front and what they do is every time they are writing from that character is perspective or about that character they will think what would that person that i know do how would they react how would they sound how would they look and kind of look at that from that perspective
2ri5hym48ma_12-2-rgb_front and what is nice is that it is not someone that you know super well and so there is still a lot of room for imagination and creative interpretation which i think is very important and we should let it do that
2ri5hym48ma_13-2-rgb_front so basically you have this really great base where you know the person enough that you have something to start with but you do not know him so well that it takes away their wonder
2ri5hym48ma_14-2-rgb_front so try that with your characters and that should really give you something to start with a really great framework
2ri5hym48ma_2-2-rgb_front and we are going to talk about character development and how to create really great characters that people are passionate about
2ri5hym48ma_3-2-rgb_front and it does not matter if they love them or they hate them or they love to hate them preferably a little of everything
2ri5hym48ma_4-2-rgb_front not necessarily with the same character that will be a little conflicted but with a range of characters that people are having this emotional experience and are able to identify with these people as they read
2ri5hym48ma_5-2-rgb_front and right now i am talking primarily about stories whether it is short stories or novels but this actually also applies to all kinds of writing even copywriting and advertising and if you are writing a storyboard for a commercial
2ri5hym48ma_6-2-rgb_front i mean you still want to know how to develop good characters
2ri5hym48ma_7-2-rgb_front but primarily i will be talking about it from the standpoint of traditional story
2ri5hym48ma_8-2-rgb_front so one thing that i find to be very helpful and that a lot of really great writers have these are writers who are rich and famous so it is obviously worked for to develop a really great character
2ri5hym48ma_9-2-rgb_front it helps to have a little bit of information but not too much information
2yudattnzrg_1-1-rgb_front now you put the eggs in before you put your flour mixture in
2yudattnzrg_10-1-rgb_front now this is you just do not put the whole thing in there you have to gradually put your flour in there
2yudattnzrg_11-1-rgb_front let me repeat you do not want to just throw it in your flour all at once
2yudattnzrg_12-1-rgb_front just gradually do it
2yudattnzrg_13-1-rgb_front maybe a couple of cups at a time
2yudattnzrg_2-1-rgb_front like i said if you still have a little crisco and it is floating around it is okay
2yudattnzrg_3-1-rgb_front at this time i am going to add my flour and it takes cups so you need to get
2yudattnzrg_4-1-rgb_front it is great if you have one of these really big measuring cups
2yudattnzrg_5-1-rgb_front let me see
2yudattnzrg_6-1-rgb_front let is get the glasses
2yudattnzrg_7-1-rgb_front let me see if i have i only have in there
2yudattnzrg_8-1-rgb_front let me add some more
2yudattnzrg_9-1-rgb_front okay i have my cups
33yrz5uzta4_0-2-rgb_front jason painter hi i am jason
33yrz5uzta4_1-2-rgb_front today we are painting on glass
33yrz5uzta4_10-2-rgb_front fill that in just like that
33yrz5uzta4_11-2-rgb_front we do not have to do anything anymore
33yrz5uzta4_12-2-rgb_front we will be defeating the purpose
33yrz5uzta4_13-2-rgb_front we will just spread that paint out thinner and thinner and just be frustrated in the end
33yrz5uzta4_14-2-rgb_front so this line here is not touching
33yrz5uzta4_15-2-rgb_front we can just put a little dab of black there same as up here
33yrz5uzta4_16-2-rgb_front just basically just want everything to touch and that is going to make a big difference when we fill in with the white
33yrz5uzta4_17-2-rgb_front so go ahead and fill in everywhere that you gotta fill in and look at it and we will wait for that to dry
33yrz5uzta4_18-2-rgb_front and touch up the white
33yrz5uzta4_2-2-rgb_front we have put the first coat the liner and the fill in on all three of the steps
33yrz5uzta4_3-2-rgb_front it is looking like it is ready now to can really start touching up the liner
33yrz5uzta4_4-2-rgb_front we can really start touching up the black
33yrz5uzta4_5-2-rgb_front if we look at it we can see spots filled in and spots that did not and we do not have to worry about how these thick really looks bad right now but we are just in the beginning stages
33yrz5uzta4_6-2-rgb_front so really those we want to do is make sure that all of the black lines connect everywhere that we know they are going to need to and all of the lines are filled in that we know we are going to need to
33yrz5uzta4_7-2-rgb_front so we just take the angle brush back again get black back out and really the less paint you have on here the better just a very little on the tip of your brush
33yrz5uzta4_8-2-rgb_front this line right here needs to be filled in and we are not actually going to make any brush strokes
33yrz5uzta4_9-2-rgb_front we are just going to set the paint right on it
33jxeiibbnm_0-1-rgb_front hi my name is dave andrews
33jxeiibbnm_1-1-rgb_front today i am going to show you how to run a macro in excel from access
33jxeiibbnm_10-1-rgb_front click on your office button
33jxeiibbnm_11-1-rgb_front go to save as
33jxeiibbnm_12-1-rgb_front we are going to save macro enable workbook
33jxeiibbnm_13-1-rgb_front let is name it book one and just say save
33jxeiibbnm_14-1-rgb_front now we need to go into access by clicking the start button all programs microsoft office
33jxeiibbnm_15-1-rgb_front let is open access
33jxeiibbnm_16-1-rgb_front we need to create a new database by clicking on the office button and saying new
33jxeiibbnm_17-1-rgb_front let is leave the name as database one and say create
33jxeiibbnm_18-1-rgb_front here is our new database
33jxeiibbnm_19-1-rgb_front to run that macro from excel macro from access hold down the alt key on the keyboard
33jxeiibbnm_2-1-rgb_front let is begin by opening up excel
33jxeiibbnm_20-1-rgb_front press
33jxeiibbnm_21-1-rgb_front this brings up the visual basic code editor
33jxeiibbnm_22-1-rgb_front go to the top
33jxeiibbnm_23-1-rgb_front say insert
33jxeiibbnm_24-1-rgb_front we are going to say module
33jxeiibbnm_25-1-rgb_front in our code editor we are going to begin typing in some code
33jxeiibbnm_26-1-rgb_front now that we have our function created in access i am going to go over it with you real quick
33jxeiibbnm_27-1-rgb_front first thing it does is it creates a variable called excel and the sign says excel value
33jxeiibbnm_28-1-rgb_front to the create object function it launches a new excel dot application scheme
33jxeiibbnm_29-1-rgb_front it then opens up a excel database that we give to it which is the path right here that i typed in and then it simply says excel dot run and then the name of the macro we created which was macro one
33jxeiibbnm_3-1-rgb_front let is first create our macro by clicking the view tab
33jxeiibbnm_30-1-rgb_front you then could link to this function excel test within an object in your database
33jxeiibbnm_31-1-rgb_front my name is dave andrews and i just showed you how to run an excel macro from access
33jxeiibbnm_4-1-rgb_front go into macros and saying record macro
33jxeiibbnm_5-1-rgb_front we are going to name this macro one just say okay
33jxeiibbnm_6-1-rgb_front all this macro is going to do is type the number one two three four across the top row
33jxeiibbnm_7-1-rgb_front so let is stop record by clicking this little drop down arrow and saying stop record
33jxeiibbnm_8-1-rgb_front now we have our macro created
33jxeiibbnm_9-1-rgb_front so let is save this as a macro enable workbook
39fn42e41r0_0-1-rgb_front michael rosengart right now i am here with two personal trainers ryan regensburg and jonesy and we are doing some renegade rows
39fn42e41r0_1-1-rgb_front so what i want you to do is go ahead and get into a push up position with two dumbbells in your hands whereas ryan is going to show us later on a little variation for it
39fn42e41r0_10-1-rgb_front so basically he is just going to work one side at a time
39fn42e41r0_11-1-rgb_front the hand on the ground will give him a little more support and will make it a little easier
39fn42e41r0_12-1-rgb_front and then once he does five he is just going to switch over to the other side
39fn42e41r0_13-1-rgb_front again for this workout we are working for fifteen to twenty reps and another variation that i want you to work on or consider if you can do it is a push up renegade row like jonesy is doing here
39fn42e41r0_14-1-rgb_front each time you are going down you are going to do a push up and then come back up
39fn42e41r0_15-1-rgb_front it helps for a couple of different reasons it helps again to condition the chest but it also helps to stretch out the anterior side of your shoulders which then allows you to get a deeper row
39fn42e41r0_16-1-rgb_front alright
39fn42e41r0_17-1-rgb_front good
39fn42e41r0_18-1-rgb_front and then once you have done with fifteen or twenty reps grab some water meet us on the next exercise in the next clip
39fn42e41r0_2-1-rgb_front jonesy is here in a push up position
39fn42e41r0_3-1-rgb_front and what you are going to do is you are going to pull one of the dumbbells up into your rib cage shifting your weight back and forth
39fn42e41r0_4-1-rgb_front now if you are just starting on this you may want to work with really wide feet
39fn42e41r0_5-1-rgb_front that will give you more balance and support as you perform alright
39fn42e41r0_6-1-rgb_front at the same time if you want a little bit more of a challenge bring your feet closer together as you work
39fn42e41r0_7-1-rgb_front exhale as you pull up and you are going to feel that you really get to use your abdominals and your obliques as you go back and forth
39fn42e41r0_8-1-rgb_front ryan go ahead and get down
39fn42e41r0_9-1-rgb_front and ryan is going to do a renegade row
3ejkvwck6ss_0-1-rgb_front now that we have blow dried and separated all the what we are going to do is go ahead and start with our finishing products
3ejkvwck6ss_1-1-rgb_front what i like to do first is i like to heat the hair up just a little bit especially just on the ends
3ejkvwck6ss_10-1-rgb_front does it make the shine stay more
3ejkvwck6ss_11-1-rgb_front it does
3ejkvwck6ss_12-1-rgb_front basically what i do by heating up the hair and you will notice when you put it in it kind of melts in your hair
3ejkvwck6ss_13-1-rgb_front it is like putting butter
3ejkvwck6ss_14-1-rgb_front when you heat up butter butter is going to spread better so basically that is what this is
3ejkvwck6ss_15-1-rgb_front it is like spreading butter
3ejkvwck6ss_16-1-rgb_front does it help with the dryness
3ejkvwck6ss_17-1-rgb_front it is not going to help with the dryness
3ejkvwck6ss_18-1-rgb_front the moisturizing conditioner is what is going to help with the dryness of your hair
3ejkvwck6ss_19-1-rgb_front what this is going to do is just help to keep its shape what we are going for
3ejkvwck6ss_2-1-rgb_front we are just going to heat up the hair
3ejkvwck6ss_20-1-rgb_front it is pliable and it is fibrous and it gives you some of that separation you want on your ends
3ejkvwck6ss_21-1-rgb_front heat it up in your palms and just pull it through
3ejkvwck6ss_22-1-rgb_front there we go
3ejkvwck6ss_23-1-rgb_front let is go ahead and go on to our next section
3ejkvwck6ss_3-1-rgb_front then what i like to do is go on with my fiber pliable paste
3ejkvwck6ss_4-1-rgb_front a lot of people ask me why do you use that product before you go ahead and finalize and finish it
3ejkvwck6ss_5-1-rgb_front i like to think about it as getting your car painted
3ejkvwck6ss_6-1-rgb_front do you know what they do before they paint your car
3ejkvwck6ss_7-1-rgb_front they prime it
3ejkvwck6ss_8-1-rgb_front basically what this is doing for me is priming your hair and getting it ready for that last shot of color
3ejkvwck6ss_9-1-rgb_front in this case hairspray
3hcjtyiijec_0-2-rgb_front urban legends are often the unwritten beliefs that people have and announce to others
3hcjtyiijec_1-2-rgb_front well what are the unwritten rules for women about dating
3hcjtyiijec_10_11-2-rgb_front they are no more successful than you are the probability is you are more successful they may have their own agenda as well
3hcjtyiijec_12-2-rgb_front so i would say the first unwritten rule is do not depend on your girl friends to give you valid input for your choices
3hcjtyiijec_13-2-rgb_front that is what it is all about
3hcjtyiijec_14-2-rgb_front this is dr paul
3hcjtyiijec_15-2-rgb_front may your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow
3hcjtyiijec_2-2-rgb_front this is dr paul author of boomer girls a boomer woman is guide to men and dating and host of ask dr paul
3hcjtyiijec_3-2-rgb_front if they are unwritten then how do we know them
3hcjtyiijec_4-2-rgb_front well they are passed on and the best thing i can say about unwritten rules is do not depend on another woman as a woman to give you valid information
3hcjtyiijec_5-2-rgb_front guess what ladies they are as equally involved with finding the answers as you are and they are not going to find them from asking you because you are also asking them
3hcjtyiijec_6-2-rgb_front it is a vicious cycle
3hcjtyiijec_7-2-rgb_front if you have questions as i often say if you want to find out about a man why ask a woman ask a man ask dr paul
3hcjtyiijec_8-2-rgb_front if you are at the point where you are asking your girlfriends for their opinions and their input then you are doing the wrong thing
3hcjtyiijec_9-2-rgb_front so the unwritten beliefs that you are going to get that data that you need from your girl friends is totally absolutely unequivocally wrong
3trmyznwgpy_0-2-rgb_front hi everybody i am john graden from the martial arts teacher is association and johngraden com
3trmyznwgpy_1-2-rgb_front how do you practice your kickboxing moves
3trmyznwgpy_10-2-rgb_front every time you throw your reverse move you always close the gap on your opponent come in engage and then clear step out the gap with a clearing technique i like to clear with a jab or i will clear with the front leg round kick
3trmyznwgpy_11-2-rgb_front so i engage step in fire fire fire clear and then here is the biggy change my alignment on the bag or the target and then repeat the process
3trmyznwgpy_12-2-rgb_front so we are mixing our snapping techniques not just doing power all the time two every attack penetrating footwork engage clearing footwork change your alignment that is always the pattern
3trmyznwgpy_13-2-rgb_front penetrate engage clear change your alignment penetrate engage clear change your alignment
3trmyznwgpy_14-2-rgb_front make sure that that is the pattern you are developing in the gym so that when you are in the ring that is how your fight comes out
3trmyznwgpy_15-2-rgb_front i am john graden
3trmyznwgpy_16-2-rgb_front i hope that helps
3trmyznwgpy_17-2-rgb_front thanks very much
3trmyznwgpy_2-2-rgb_front that is a great question
3trmyznwgpy_3-2-rgb_front as a kickboxer this is one i am particularly fond of
3trmyznwgpy_4-2-rgb_front here is a common mistake that people make when they are dong their kickboxing moves
3trmyznwgpy_5-2-rgb_front if i am hitting the bag or i am doing the targets most beginners will try and power every single move
3trmyznwgpy_6-2-rgb_front they will try and slam the bag every move and what happens when you do that is one you waste a lot of energy two you tense the body up three you tend to run out of gas faster
3trmyznwgpy_7-2-rgb_front you do not typically spar like that or fight like that in a match so you want to train like you fight in a match and how is that
3trmyznwgpy_8-2-rgb_front i will have techniques that i am just going to snap and i am just going to pop out there so i might go snap snap snap snap snap and about every seventh or eight go pow pow pow pow pow and then i recover
3trmyznwgpy_9-2-rgb_front pow pow pow pow so i am mixing my snapping my speed techniques with my power techniques two every time you step in and every time you throw a technique you want to make sure you are penetrating with your footwork and you are not standing in one spot digging a hole
3szjsncqxpi_1-1-rgb_front now depending on your style of play if you like to play offense or defense you should be able to choose before you start the game where you want to go on the field
3szjsncqxpi_2-1-rgb_front if you are willing to play defense you should stay in the back where you can see the field clearly and be able to communicate with your teammates who move forward
3szjsncqxpi_3-1-rgb_front now if defense is not your thing and you like to play more offense when you are playing up front be sure that you communicate with your teammate who is playing defense
3szjsncqxpi_4-1-rgb_front ask them where the teammates of the other team are so you can be able to be able not get shot at from an area where you are not looking
3szjsncqxpi_5-1-rgb_front if you are playing offense and you are up front make sure you are laying down as much fire as possible to keep the other team from not shooting at you
3xni-i6n3ey_1-1-rgb_front this medicine has been around for over years
3xni-i6n3ey_2-1-rgb_front before recorded history between bc and ad the yellow emperor is classic was written down so there was a huge amount of time when medicine was being practiced upon in the china continent and its fundamental principles all came back to the philosophies that were also moving across
3xni-i6n3ey_3-1-rgb_front you had observation as the key point
3xni-i6n3ey_4-1-rgb_front it was sacrilegious to dissect the human body so the systems of acupuncture acupressure as well as the use of herbs all came about through trial and error and they all came about through the constellations of the stars and the idea reflected of the micro and the macro so that points were developed for the purpose of releasing this natural flow of chi
3xni-i6n3ey_5-1-rgb_front in this next segment we will talk about the six external causes of illness
40jrpcyzkwg_1-1-rgb_front if you look out on the market you are going to find a lot of different types of equipment
40jrpcyzkwg_2-1-rgb_front the two big ones i want to talk about though right now are metal versus plastic
40jrpcyzkwg_3-1-rgb_front if you remember to make good biodiesel we need a lot of heat
40jrpcyzkwg_4-1-rgb_front typically if you find metal processors you are going to get better reaction simply because the heat is better
40jrpcyzkwg_5-1-rgb_front you also want to look for good mixing as well
40jrpcyzkwg_6-1-rgb_front also because we are dealing with a flammable substance methanol it is a little bit safer if you use metal tanks versus plastic tanks
40jrpcyzkwg_7-1-rgb_front also if you are heating within the tank you do not want your tank to melt on you so i kinda recommend metal tanks over plastic tanks
40jrpcyzkwg_8-1-rgb_front do your research look hard but look for the plastic look for the metal see which ones work the best for you
40jrpcyzkwg_9-1-rgb_front again calling it referrals but my feeling is you can make better biodiesel with metal tanks
46cwjrd4ua4_0-2-rgb_front now the next environmental factors that you want to look at are the date and the year
46cwjrd4ua4_1-2-rgb_front when does this take place
46cwjrd4ua4_10-2-rgb_front is it taking place in the summer
46cwjrd4ua4_11-2-rgb_front the fall
46cwjrd4ua4_12-2-rgb_front the spring
46cwjrd4ua4_13-2-rgb_front these are real important things because let is say it is taking place in new orleans in the summer
46cwjrd4ua4_14-2-rgb_front well that means it is going to be hot and muggy and that is going to directly affect how your character is going to respond
46cwjrd4ua4_15-2-rgb_front or is it taking place in north dakota in the winter where it is very very cold
46cwjrd4ua4_16-2-rgb_front that will affect how your character reacts and responds and moves and so forth and so on
46cwjrd4ua4_17-2-rgb_front you also need to take a look at the time period in the sense of how long does this whole interaction of this play or movie take place
46cwjrd4ua4_18-2-rgb_front is it a day
46cwjrd4ua4_19-2-rgb_front is it a week
46cwjrd4ua4_2-2-rgb_front is it

4vxvnpxteew_2-1-rgb_front the wind chill and your dress
4vxvnpxteew_3-1-rgb_front you dress for wind chill not for the temperature that you have outside
4vxvnpxteew_4-1-rgb_front for instance right here since we been filming here for this clip a cloud came over and the temperature dropped ten degrees just in the last two minutes
4vxvnpxteew_5-1-rgb_front and the wind chill actually adds extra to that temperature drop
4vxvnpxteew_6-1-rgb_front so wind chill we will take a look at this wind chill chart and i will show you what kind of temperature drops you have even for a minor change in the wind
4vxvnpxteew_7-1-rgb_front on this wind chill chart you have the temperature across the top and then you have the wind speed along the sides
4vxvnpxteew_8-1-rgb_front and then you just cross reference your data and you will come up with the actual real temperature real life temperature that you have to dress for
4vxvnpxteew_9-1-rgb_front a five degree shift in the wind will drop the actual real life temperature ten to fifteen degrees
4xgovmg-zio_0-1-rgb_front i am going to show you how to make a bluebird
4xgovmg-zio_1-1-rgb_front now this drink is stirred and not shaken so you do not need much ice
4xgovmg-zio_10-1-rgb_front despite it is blue flavor it has an orange taste behind it
4xgovmg-zio_11-1-rgb_front then you are going to add a couple dashes of bitters so have that handy
4xgovmg-zio_12-1-rgb_front do just a couple
4xgovmg-zio_13-1-rgb_front that should be good
4xgovmg-zio_14-1-rgb_front and then you are going to stir it so have your stirrer available
4xgovmg-zio_15-1-rgb_front put it in and twist it around just like that
4xgovmg-zio_16-1-rgb_front looks good
4xgovmg-zio_17-1-rgb_front then you are going to strain it in to a glass
4xgovmg-zio_18-1-rgb_front so grab your glass have your stainer available and gently pout it in
4xgovmg-zio_19-1-rgb_front just like so
4xgovmg-zio_2-1-rgb_front so take it put it in to your glass
4xgovmg-zio_20-1-rgb_front and you are going to garnish this with a cherry and a lemon twist that you can twist
4xgovmg-zio_21-1-rgb_front pour in just like that put in your straw and then you have a blue bird
4xgovmg-zio_3-1-rgb_front you are going to add an ounce and half of gin
4xgovmg-zio_4-1-rgb_front so get your jigger
4xgovmg-zio_5-1-rgb_front pour in an ounce flip it over and add the half of ounce
4xgovmg-zio_6-1-rgb_front then you are going to add an ounce of trip sec actually half an ounce of triple sec
4xgovmg-zio_7-1-rgb_front just grab that
4xgovmg-zio_8-1-rgb_front to the small side of the jigger

4xlvmrxlydg_0-5-rgb_front we are going to do gathering chi from heaven and earth
4xlvmrxlydg_1-5-rgb_front and i want you to if you would like to follow along with me that had be great
4xlvmrxlydg_10-5-rgb_front there are so many movements in qigung that when you learn a great amount of qigung you could pick what you would like to do what your body can handle
4xlvmrxlydg_11-5-rgb_front ok
4xlvmrxlydg_12-5-rgb_front and a real simple one is gathering chi from heaven and earth
4xlvmrxlydg_13-5-rgb_front and what i would like to do is demonstrate the form for you and kind of just talk through the form as you are watching me do this
4xlvmrxlydg_14-5-rgb_front so we always want to start out in the wu chi posture
4xlvmrxlydg_15-5-rgb_front right first one always stand in the wu chi posture
4xlvmrxlydg_16-5-rgb_front work your way from the feet up to the top of the head
4xlvmrxlydg_17-5-rgb_front once you do that then you go to your breathing
4xlvmrxlydg_18-5-rgb_front inhale exhale
4xlvmrxlydg_19-5-rgb_front ok
4xlvmrxlydg_2-5-rgb_front but gathering chi from heaven and earth one of the great things about qigung is that the movements can be very very simple
4xlvmrxlydg_20-5-rgb_front from here once you have a feeling of peace and focus that the mind is not racing around anymore that you are very calm and relaxed let is begin the movement then
4xlvmrxlydg_21-5-rgb_front then begin the posture and the movement is what we are going to do which is gathering chi from heaven and earth
4xlvmrxlydg_3-5-rgb_front we do not have to do any complex movements here
4xlvmrxlydg_4-5-rgb_front there are complex movements later on in higher levels of qigung
4xlvmrxlydg_5-5-rgb_front but the wonderful thing about qigung is that quigung can be done with any age group
4xlvmrxlydg_6-5-rgb_front any age group
4xlvmrxlydg_7-5-rgb_front we have movements in qigung that eighty year olds can do ninety year olds can do
4xlvmrxlydg_8-5-rgb_front we have movements in quigung that require stronger flexibility more endurance and so on
4xlvmrxlydg_9-5-rgb_front but the point to this is that when you do qigung you can do so many different movements
5gw0tpbcmtq_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is floyd i am talking to you today from theacousticmusician com in sandy utah and we are going to talk about how to read guitar music today
5gw0tpbcmtq_1-5-rgb_front the most common form of guitar music that is used nowadays is called tablature
5gw0tpbcmtq_2-5-rgb_front and that is this line here and what it is is each one of the lines here represents the strings on the guitar
5gw0tpbcmtq_3-5-rgb_front this would be your high e this would be your low e and this shows which fret or the position on the guitar that you would play
5gw0tpbcmtq_4-5-rgb_front now the line up here is standard notation which a lot of people do not know how to read
5gw0tpbcmtq_5-5-rgb_front but this just shows finger position and note placement on the strings to be able to play the guitar
5rr7dlzkyl0_0-5-rgb_front now first of all i want to tell you when you are doing business over the phone you automatically lose a huge part of your ability to communicate
5rr7dlzkyl0_1-5-rgb_front and what i am talking about is no longer do you have any to work with
5rr7dlzkyl0_2-5-rgb_front whoever is on the other end of that phone they can not see your face they can not see your body they can not read what you are doing or what is in your environment
5rr7dlzkyl0_3-5-rgb_front so basically all you are left with is your tone of voice
5rr7dlzkyl0_4-5-rgb_front your attitude which comes through in your tone of voice and this is what you have to work with
5rr7dlzkyl0_5-5-rgb_front this is what will convey your professionalism
5rr7dlzkyl0_6-5-rgb_front this is what will convey your willingness to listen and to help and to be a professional
5rr7dlzkyl0_7-5-rgb_front so it is very important that we focus on the specifics of working with such few things
bl4zqiuzo1u_1-5-rgb_front minimum counter battens are run vertical and centered over existing rafters
bl4zqiuzo1u_2-5-rgb_front a moisture membrane of felt tri flex or ice and water shield is placed horizontally with proper lap to allow the membrane to loop over the counter battens
bl4zqiuzo1u_3-5-rgb_front the main framing and details are then continued
bl4zqiuzo1u_4-5-rgb_front care must be taken to protect the membrane from penetrations
bl4zqiuzo1u_5-5-rgb_front all cuts and penetrations should be sealed with tape
bl4zqiuzo1u_6-5-rgb_front in a situation where you work from the top down or where there is a back set fascia you will need to telescope the lowest course under the next full course of tiles
bl4zqiuzo1u_7-5-rgb_front in order to hold the panels in plain you will need to install a filler strip to support the back of the first course in lieu of the batten usually a inch wide board will suffice
bmxb5nth8ha_1-5-rgb_front i am with the kelly white team and today we are going to tell you how to buy a house
bmxb5nth8ha_10-5-rgb_front but most of the time it is a pleasant surprise
bmxb5nth8ha_11-5-rgb_front what we do with that prequalification letter when time comes to present the offer we always include the prequalification letter for reasons
bmxb5nth8ha_12-5-rgb_front first of all it shows the seller that you are serious and it shows the realtor that you do have that money to purchase that house
bmxb5nth8ha_13-5-rgb_front a prequalification is really important
bmxb5nth8ha_2-5-rgb_front the prequalification letter it is very very important for so many reasons
bmxb5nth8ha_3-5-rgb_front a prequalitfication letter is you are going to meet with a mortgage broker and the mortgage broker is going to run all your numbers find your credit score and everything
bmxb5nth8ha_4-5-rgb_front it is going to find out how much that bank can lend you
bmxb5nth8ha_5-5-rgb_front because this is important you are not really buying the house the bank is buying the house
bmxb5nth8ha_6-5-rgb_front the bank is loaning you the money to buy that house
bmxb5nth8ha_7-5-rgb_front this is a a prequalification letter
bmxb5nth8ha_8-5-rgb_front the reason it is important is first of all we find out how much you can spend
bmxb5nth8ha_9-5-rgb_front sometimes it is a pleasant surprise sometimes it is oh my god
bzqxt5uyud8_10-5-rgb_front because when you come home you want to get the calls back to your phone you hit another number and in my case
bzqxt5uyud8_11-5-rgb_front listen and it will undo that call forwarding
bzqxt5uyud8_12-5-rgb_front each phone company will have a different sequence of numbers
bzqxt5uyud8_13-5-rgb_front so make sure you check that before you start take advantage of that facility
bzqxt5uyud8_14-5-rgb_front but call forwarding is a really really great tool for home or for business
bzqxt5uyud8_15-5-rgb_front kathy pabst robshaw telephone effectiveness
bzqxt5uyud8_4-5-rgb_front it is really easy to do you can forward a call from your home phone to your cell to your office to your neighbor all you need to do is make sure you have got the number that your phone company has allocated to you
bzqxt5uyud8_5-5-rgb_front in my case it is
bzqxt5uyud8_6-5-rgb_front i hit here a message it tells me what to do
bzqxt5uyud8_7-5-rgb_front generally i would put in the number that the call is meant to be forwarded to and then automatically it happens i do not think about it
bzqxt5uyud8_8-5-rgb_front hang up walk away it happens
bzqxt5uyud8_9-5-rgb_front the easiest thing to do is just make sure that you keep track of the number that you have used so that you can undo it
btg-2tz5cnk_4-5-rgb_front once again this is something that we we do not sell a whole lot of these days but we still would like for you to know a little bit about it just in case any of you all out there still use chlorine
btg-2tz5cnk_5-5-rgb_front this this is a very good way of being able to test the level of chlorine that you have in your water
btg-2tz5cnk_6-5-rgb_front so with that being said that is just a little bit about chlorine test papers
c0fpzgey2rg_0-5-rgb_front how does a snake grow
c0fpzgey2rg_1-5-rgb_front well that is a good question
c0fpzgey2rg_10-5-rgb_front obviously an adult snake grows a lot less than a baby snake so they are going to shed a lot less but they do need to shed every once in a while to revitalize their scales repair any damage that may have occurred and continue on with their healthy life
c0fpzgey2rg_2-5-rgb_front snakes grow in a kind of different way than we do
c0fpzgey2rg_3-5-rgb_front people shed skin every day all day as they grow and change and move around
c0fpzgey2rg_4-5-rgb_front snake scales are a little different they are more like an armor coating on the outside they do not allow for such free growth so what actually happens is they shed their skin like right down here we have shed skin from a baby corn snake well not really too much of a baby any more
c0fpzgey2rg_5-5-rgb_front what they do is they rub their head against something here is the head over here
c0fpzgey2rg_6-5-rgb_front they rub their head to split their skin and then slowly roll it off of them kind of like taking off a sock from the top down until this is actually inside out
c0fpzgey2rg_7-5-rgb_front when it comes off of them and it is inside out
c0fpzgey2rg_8-5-rgb_front then you can actually see all the little individual scales on the top and you can see all of the belly scales on the bottom and they do this depending on the size of the snake
c0fpzgey2rg_9-5-rgb_front a baby snake might shed every week to an adult snake that might shed once a year so it really varies as to how often they are going to shed their skin because it depends on how much they are growing
c4lsh3mz4ju_0-5-rgb_front hi
c4lsh3mz4ju_11-5-rgb_front now we are up to where the rip begins and we are going to be sewing again just about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of an inch stitches and now we are going to go across the rip and enter here again
c4lsh3mz4ju_12-5-rgb_front just about eighth of an inch away from the edge of the rip
c4lsh3mz4ju_13-5-rgb_front as long as the material is not fraying and you can put the needle in and it will not be coming out there
c4lsh3mz4ju_14-5-rgb_front you pull that through
c4lsh3mz4ju_15-5-rgb_front see how the stitches are coming perpendicular to the rip and let me get a few more and i will show you what to do
c4lsh3mz4ju_16-5-rgb_front okay so then once we get a bunch f those we are going to pull very gently and see how it pulls that rip right together
c4lsh3mz4ju_17-5-rgb_front it almost looks ike a seam
c4lsh3mz4ju_18-5-rgb_front so the smaller the stitches the more delicate the repair will be
c4lsh3mz4ju_2-5-rgb_front now i am going to show you how to repair a rip with a blind stitch
c4lsh3mz4ju_3-5-rgb_front okay here is our rip and if you are doing a repair you want to match the thread color to the color of the garment
c4lsh3mz4ju_4-5-rgb_front match as closely as possible but for purposes of showing you so that you can exactly what i am doing and what the stitch looks like i am going to use black thread
c4lsh3mz4ju_5-5-rgb_front that should make it easier for you to see this
c4lsh3mz4ju_6-5-rgb_front you want to knot your thread like i showed you nice good knot and we are going to come up from the back of the garment about half an inch from the start of the rip
c4lsh3mz4ju_7-5-rgb_front you are going to come up from the back to the front of the fabric and then you are going to make the needle go back in just a very small amount like a centimeter and take with the needle only less than a quarter inch probably eighth of inch of fabric and pull very loosely and then you will go on the opposite side of it where you came out you go in and take again about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of fabric like this and then you go directly down from it again and but a little bit wider
c4lsh3mz4ju_8-5-rgb_front you are going to start very small and close and a little wider a little wider and you will see what we are going to get
c4lsh3mz4ju_9_10-5-rgb_front there you go now your stitches start off small bigger bigger and they are straight up and down perpendicular to the rip about an eighth of an inch and go in down here
c6fvni9qlyu_1-5-rgb_front you can not see it so i do not know what to explain it it is not a box blade so whatever when you have it at an angle whatever whatever catches on this side is gonna ride down and gonna run out that side so you are gonna have you will have stock piled down at the end
c6fvni9qlyu_2-5-rgb_front it does not gather it up on both side and bring it through
c6fvni9qlyu_3-5-rgb_front it will catch snow and push it over to the side of the road or it will catch dirt out of a high spot and move it over to the side
c6fvni9qlyu_4-5-rgb_front but this unlike the box blade is not boxed in so whatever catches on the front side will roll down the blade and it will eventually go over to the side
c6fvni9qlyu_5-5-rgb_front and you want that for snow removal or just to get something out of the way because you want to get it out of the road off to the side of the road and that is what this kind of blade would be for
c9orduxwoeq_0-5-rgb_front this is a tire pressure gauge
c9orduxwoeq_1-5-rgb_front you check the pressure of the tires and to change tire pressures every time you come in depending on track conditions the track continues to change every single time you go out there
c9orduxwoeq_2-5-rgb_front this is really easy to use its got a number gauge on it
c9orduxwoeq_3-5-rgb_front you just hook it up into this valve and it will show you a read
c9orduxwoeq_4-5-rgb_front you just read the ticks and you adjust the higher pressure with this little button and it just lets air out of the tire
c9orduxwoeq_5-5-rgb_front its really easy to use
c9orduxwoeq_6-5-rgb_front you can put air pressure in the tires by an air tank that is pressurized the same thing but this is putting pressure in the tire instead of out
c9orduxwoeq_7-5-rgb_front it depends on how much the track is changing but most times its only one or two psi your taking in or out of the tire
cfrh_kot9ny_0-5-rgb_front hi this is jon and in this clip we will be talking about the portable shop table
cfrh_kot9ny_1-5-rgb_front as you begin to accessorize your wood shop you might also want to think about purchasing a portable shop table
cfrh_kot9ny_2-5-rgb_front you will notice on one side there are wheels at the base of each of the legs and at the other side we just have our standard feet
cfrh_kot9ny_3-5-rgb_front now as you work on your projects around your shop you will need to move them from station to station so at this table you will just lift up on one end and you can easily wheel it to the next station maybe you are going to a table saw or a planer
cfrh_kot9ny_4-5-rgb_front now some of these tables have handles built into them to make them a little bit more ergonomic and comfortable or if you are looking for more of a custom mobile workbench you can always go on line and search for free mobile workbench plans and that should bring up several different plans that you can build yourself
cfrh_kot9ny_5-5-rgb_front now you will notice that our workbench here in the shop is made of metal
cfrh_kot9ny_6-5-rgb_front now if the surface gets scratched it will scratch your lumber so if you are building one or even if you purchase a metal one you might want to think about putting a wooden top on it so that if it does get scratched you could refinish it and make it smooth again
co6qyvvglae_0-5-rgb_front and now we are going to talk about some inputs that you can run through your board
co6qyvvglae_1-5-rgb_front here we have the denon cd player
co6qyvvglae_10-5-rgb_front important things you need to know about the denon player is when you want to change tracks you use this button that is called push and you turn it sideways
co6qyvvglae_11-5-rgb_front do not push it turn it sideways
co6qyvvglae_12-5-rgb_front and you can see the track numbers is advancing
co6qyvvglae_13-5-rgb_front one two three
co6qyvvglae_14-5-rgb_front ok
co6qyvvglae_15-5-rgb_front so there we go
co6qyvvglae_16-5-rgb_front that is how you change tracks
co6qyvvglae_17-5-rgb_front and when you are ready to play hit play obviously
co6qyvvglae_18-5-rgb_front now a great feature of the denon cd player is if you decide this is the track you want instead of hitting pause which just pauses it or hitting stop which actually would bring you back to track one you can hit go find the track you want again track three in this case
co6qyvvglae_19-5-rgb_front hit play
co6qyvvglae_2-5-rgb_front has many features
co6qyvvglae_20-5-rgb_front yes that is what i want
co6qyvvglae_21-5-rgb_front and then you hit the cue button and what that does is is it brings you back to the beginning of track three
co6qyvvglae_22-5-rgb_front so find your track with the turning this button that says push on it paradoxically
co6qyvvglae_23-5-rgb_front and then use cue to go to the beginning of the track you want to play
co6qyvvglae_3-5-rgb_front some of which are not fantastically useful
co6qyvvglae_4-5-rgb_front let is play some music here
co6qyvvglae_5-5-rgb_front ok
co6qyvvglae_6-5-rgb_front so it has your basic cd player features
co6qyvvglae_7-5-rgb_front stop obviously duh
co6qyvvglae_8-5-rgb_front play woohoo
co6qyvvglae_9-5-rgb_front and you know pause no surprise there
csxgjlymlz4_0-5-rgb_front another very good use although a slightly more risky use of a wading wedge is carrying a backboard in a cross moving current
csxgjlymlz4_1-5-rgb_front now while you should attempt to put the backboard in a raft or in something a lot more stationery and steady than a wade this is a last resort so you can use it
csxgjlymlz4_2-5-rgb_front you need a lot of people the three people to create the wedge at the front and then a number of people down each side of the backboard where it is positioned in the middle
csxgjlymlz4_3-5-rgb_front the head should be at the front so that way if the feet get dropped into the water the water will tend to plane the backboard up to the surface of the water
csxgjlymlz4_4-5-rgb_front now at all times during this wade you need one person who is designated to maintaining the airway of whoever is on the backboard
csxgjlymlz4_5-5-rgb_front if at any time the backboard drops into the water you have created a very bad situation because that person is trapped on the board
csxgjlymlz4_6-5-rgb_front if you have the opportunity to do this that person should be facing down stream over them in a better position to maintain their airway
czkli34hfig_0-5-rgb_front so i am going to take these pants over and go ahead and press them down
czkli34hfig_1-5-rgb_front and i am going to show you how we are going to mark where we are going to cut off the pants
czkli34hfig_10-5-rgb_front okay so now that i have this pressed down i am going to go ahead and flip these pants back out because i need to see that excess fabric so i can determine where i am going to cut it off
czkli34hfig_11-5-rgb_front okay here we go
czkli34hfig_12-5-rgb_front and when i do this if i have to cut off the fabric i like to leave about an inch excess fabric in the inside
czkli34hfig_13-5-rgb_front and that is a good idea just in case say someone else wants to wear them they will have a little bit to work with
czkli34hfig_14-5-rgb_front if they need to let the hem out because you can still let the pants out and still have some original hem left
czkli34hfig_15-5-rgb_front so i am just going to start right here where i put that one little seam that i sewed myself and mark inch
czkli34hfig_16-5-rgb_front here we go
czkli34hfig_17-5-rgb_front and on this side and also on the next side
czkli34hfig_18-5-rgb_front okay it is all the way around
czkli34hfig_19-5-rgb_front so in a minute i am going to show you how i am going to talk about it and show you how we are going to trim this off
czkli34hfig_2-5-rgb_front so let is go over here to my work table and here we go
czkli34hfig_20-5-rgb_front and i will show you how to do that next
czkli34hfig_3-5-rgb_front so the first thing i want to do is go ahead and iron this down just like i did the other leg just kind of pull it a tiny bit there we go
czkli34hfig_4-5-rgb_front i am just going to iron right here along the seam
czkli34hfig_5-5-rgb_front and like i said before i like do that just because i know the fabric is right were it is supposed to be and you give it that little press
czkli34hfig_6-5-rgb_front now this side okay
czkli34hfig_7-5-rgb_front then we are going to open it and get that crease that i put there out
czkli34hfig_8-5-rgb_front i am going to do the inside also
czkli34hfig_9-5-rgb_front okay because we have already done this once so i am just going to get after and do it
d4natjnembu_1-5-rgb_front okay sausage today we are going to do a creole shrimp sausage the thing about creole and cajun cooking or sausage making is that they stuff about anything
d4natjnembu_2-5-rgb_front into the casings and the sausage of you can do rabbit you can do goose you can do chicken turkey catfish i mean basically anything
d4natjnembu_3-5-rgb_front the trick is to figure out the right seasonings that goes well with those meats that you use for that sausage
d4natjnembu_4-5-rgb_front today what were going to do is a shrimp creole shrimp sausage it is going to be kind of spicy and were going to use some pork to actually bine that together
d4natjnembu_5-5-rgb_front another option would be to eliminate the pork and you can actually use egg whites to create that bite
d4natjnembu_6-5-rgb_front for this recipe were going to use a little bit of pork and shrimp to make our fillings so let is get started
dedvsxbut4i_0-5-rgb_front ace suited ace suited this is pretty much the best omaha high low hand because what it gives you gives you the aces you can win the high if you catch another ace or two
dedvsxbut4i_1-5-rgb_front it gives you suited ace and suited ace
dedvsxbut4i_2-5-rgb_front with these you can pick up a high of a straight you can pick up a high of a flush and you can pick up a high of a straight flush
dedvsxbut4i_3-5-rgb_front so you have a number of ways to win a high and also you have a number of ways to win the low
dedvsxbut4i_4-5-rgb_front what does that mean visually
dedvsxbut4i_5-5-rgb_front well let is take a look at this board here that i laid out
dedvsxbut4i_6-5-rgb_front we got a board of jack and and our opponent has played a rather another and for omaha high low
dedvsxbut4i_7-5-rgb_front but played it none the less and managed to draw out on us and catch the high of a straight to a queen
dedvsxbut4i_8-5-rgb_front at last he does not win the low with his and he does not even qualify for a low because he matches the
dedvsxbut4i_9-5-rgb_front we on the other hand have a low hand we have deuce ace so we would win half of the pot
dkjtnsrjiro_0-5-rgb_front so we have the bottom prepared and we have got our little bowl that has the pedestal and this is set up as well
dkjtnsrjiro_1-5-rgb_front it also is leather hard
dkjtnsrjiro_10-5-rgb_front so again i am going to spin it and i am going to tap it on center
dkjtnsrjiro_11-5-rgb_front and press down in the middle you notice it slid at first that was the suction releasing
dkjtnsrjiro_12-5-rgb_front you press down in the middle and that recreates that suction
dkjtnsrjiro_13-5-rgb_front so it is important that this is hard enough before you start trimming that you can actually give some good pressure there in the center
dkjtnsrjiro_14-5-rgb_front and next we will trim it
dkjtnsrjiro_2-5-rgb_front now as you can see when i set it on there it is a little too big
dkjtnsrjiro_3-5-rgb_front it does not quite slip into that pedestal
dkjtnsrjiro_4-5-rgb_front so i have to trim this as well
dkjtnsrjiro_5-5-rgb_front so what i need to do in order to trim this first you want to get the wheel head wet
dkjtnsrjiro_6-5-rgb_front this is important because i just use suction to hold my pieces to the wheel
dkjtnsrjiro_7-5-rgb_front and that is going to happen because when i put this wet lip against this wet piece and i am going to drop it kind of hard
dkjtnsrjiro_8-5-rgb_front and now it is sucked on there
dkjtnsrjiro_9-5-rgb_front i am hitting and it is not moving
dkozsnhwsfi_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is dave schoeneck and we are talking about how you are going to feel after your first day of adaptive skiing
dkozsnhwsfi_1-5-rgb_front in some of the things to prepare would be obviously some upper body stretching
dkozsnhwsfi_10-5-rgb_front it is going to be how much fun you had and you just wont be able to wait until you get back up and do it again
dkozsnhwsfi_2-5-rgb_front upper body and abdominal exercises
dkozsnhwsfi_3-5-rgb_front that always helps in preparation but after the first day you might be a little sore
dkozsnhwsfi_4-5-rgb_front you probably will use muscles that you have not used before but with that soreness will come a tremendous amount of exuberance and having fun
dkozsnhwsfi_5-5-rgb_front at having being out on the mountain and just you wont be able to wait until you can get back up and ski again
dkozsnhwsfi_6-5-rgb_front but again the more and more you can prepare any of your upper body muscles and with weights and stretching the better off you are going to be
dkozsnhwsfi_7-5-rgb_front some of the muscles that you will use would be obviously your forearms your biceps your lats your back
dkozsnhwsfi_8-5-rgb_front be a number of things you will can not find muscles that you did not forgot you even had but those are really the upper body is doing a awful lot of the work for you and then you just let the ski do the rest of the work
dkozsnhwsfi_9-5-rgb_front so but again the biggest thing that you are going to think about after your first day is not the aching muscles
ddzxfgb4w2c_0-5-rgb_front okay
ddzxfgb4w2c_1-5-rgb_front our fish has been in the oven for about minutes so now it is time to take it out
ddzxfgb4w2c_10-5-rgb_front this is we are just going take our knife and the broccoli and just cut the ends off of our florets like so
ddzxfgb4w2c_11-5-rgb_front just enough for two people is what we need to do
ddzxfgb4w2c_12-5-rgb_front and if you have more than two people you are welcome to save these stems and eat them too if you would like
ddzxfgb4w2c_13-5-rgb_front i happen to prefer just the broccoli florets
ddzxfgb4w2c_14-5-rgb_front and to this we are going to go over to the sink so we can put an inch of water
ddzxfgb4w2c_15-5-rgb_front we just need a little bit of water in here at the bottom just a little bit of water
ddzxfgb4w2c_16-5-rgb_front and i am going to put the broccoli florets in here like so
ddzxfgb4w2c_17-5-rgb_front i am going to cover them and i am going to put them on the stove here we go and i am going to boil them with high heat
ddzxfgb4w2c_18-5-rgb_front so just that little bit of water is really going to be more like steaming so it is not going to be overcooked so it is going to be a bright green
ddzxfgb4w2c_19-5-rgb_front and i am going to check them every once in a while but it takes about minutes to cook
ddzxfgb4w2c_2-5-rgb_front you can see the garlic is still in there and here is our fish packet
ddzxfgb4w2c_20-5-rgb_front so keep clicking we are getting close to putting it all together
ddzxfgb4w2c_3-5-rgb_front yum
ddzxfgb4w2c_4-5-rgb_front the garlic still needs to cook
ddzxfgb4w2c_5-5-rgb_front here we go
ddzxfgb4w2c_6-5-rgb_front now we are just going to let this sit here and do what i like to call residual cooking
ddzxfgb4w2c_7-5-rgb_front actually all meats do that when you take them out of the heat the heat that is in there continues to cook the meat
ddzxfgb4w2c_8-5-rgb_front and that is what is going to keep it really moist and incredibly delicious texture soft texture
ddzxfgb4w2c_9-5-rgb_front so meanwhile let is just quickly do our broccoli
dfnhnkte7me_0-5-rgb_front i got my first job back in on a tv series called miami vice
dfnhnkte7me_1-5-rgb_front they were down in miami filming locally of course where the series was shot
dfnhnkte7me_10-5-rgb_front i think i was a little bit thinner a lot thinner then and i had really high cheekbones and because of the way i looked somehow i had a russian look to me
dfnhnkte7me_11_12-5-rgb_front and the director who happened to be eddie olmos who played capt castillo on the series he saw my face and said strong face great bones
dfnhnkte7me_13-5-rgb_front looks russian to me
dfnhnkte7me_14-5-rgb_front let is put him in the suit so to speak
dfnhnkte7me_15-5-rgb_front so i was an guy running around trying to kill crockett and tubbs with a machine gun for most of the show
dfnhnkte7me_16-5-rgb_front i think the biggest break for me working in film was being associated with a real high quality project
dfnhnkte7me_17-5-rgb_front i did monster with charlize theron in
dfnhnkte7me_18-5-rgb_front and it was a little independent movie
dfnhnkte7me_19-5-rgb_front it was actually lower that the screen actors guild is standard and we all got a low budget pay for it
dfnhnkte7me_2-5-rgb_front and a call came out to all the actors aspiring actors in the area that a casting director was looking for people that had skill and were comfortable in front of a camera to work on a tv show called miami vice
dfnhnkte7me_20-5-rgb_front but you know that is the great thing about this business you never know where or how the project you are taking might develop or create a buzz or get elevated you know as some films do
dfnhnkte7me_21-5-rgb_front and for her it got her an academy award
dfnhnkte7me_22-5-rgb_front so i was in a scene with charlize theron in monster
dfnhnkte7me_23-5-rgb_front and during the course of all the accolades and awards that she received for that i think that it was either the screen actors guild award show which was telecast on tnt or something turner is broadcasting who showed that she mentioned my name
dfnhnkte7me_24-5-rgb_front she thanked me
dfnhnkte7me_25-5-rgb_front and i only worked one night with her
dfnhnkte7me_26-5-rgb_front we had a long scene to do
dfnhnkte7me_27-5-rgb_front i remember it being very cold and i was very bloody and in my underwear which makes you wonder wow i have got to go back and rent that now
dfnhnkte7me_28-5-rgb_front so yeah do that go rent it because residuals also help us actors and anything you can do to help me i would appreciate it
dfnhnkte7me_29-5-rgb_front so go rent the movie and check out the scene
dfnhnkte7me_3-5-rgb_front so i went in not knowing what to expect really you know
dfnhnkte7me_4-5-rgb_front this was my first introduction to it and i got sides
dfnhnkte7me_5-5-rgb_front and i was told you know memorize these sides or look at them and then come back in and i am going to put you on camera doing this
dfnhnkte7me_6-5-rgb_front so i did that and they liked me
dfnhnkte7me_7-5-rgb_front and i got hired as an actor on miami vice
dfnhnkte7me_8-5-rgb_front that was my first job
dfnhnkte7me_9-5-rgb_front and i was playing a russian kgb agent
dwlvtukfv3s_0-5-rgb_front as you are getting ready for the ball to come over the net and to hit it it is important that you are moving side to side and then bouncing on the balls of your feet
dwlvtukfv3s_1-5-rgb_front you should never just stay put
dwlvtukfv3s_2-5-rgb_front you should be moving because that is going to give you the energy to get the ball
dwlvtukfv3s_3-5-rgb_front you should have your knees bent your feet spread out moving side to side
dwlvtukfv3s_4-5-rgb_front then your back should be angled so that you are ready to move
dwlvtukfv3s_5-5-rgb_front if you were leaning back like this it is going to be harder to get up to go get the ball
dwlvtukfv3s_6-5-rgb_front so when it is all working right you are going to have your feet moving all the time your hands and your racket moving side to side your shoulders your eyes following the ball
eqwfrwervjq_1-3-rgb_front and today we are going to learn how to set up a drum kit

eqwfrwervjq_14-5-rgb_front and then this is the boom and then this is the head
eqwfrwervjq_15-3-rgb_front we will ahead and loosen both of those and get the head to where you think it is close enough to an good angle and then the boom and tighten
eqwfrwervjq_15-5-rgb_front we will ahead and loosen both of those and get the head to where you think it is close enough to an good angle and then the boom and tighten
eqwfrwervjq_16-3-rgb_front you might looks like it is a little indiscernible
eqwfrwervjq_16-5-rgb_front you might looks like it is a little indiscernible
eqwfrwervjq_17-3-rgb_front i am just eyeballing it
eqwfrwervjq_17-5-rgb_front i am just eyeballing it
eqwfrwervjq_18-3-rgb_front i think that is pretty close for right now
eqwfrwervjq_18-5-rgb_front i think that is pretty close for right now
eqwfrwervjq_2-3-rgb_front so now that all the drums are set up and we have set up our stand we are going to set up our first crash cymbal stand

eqwfrwervjq_4-3-rgb_front and we are going to tighten it up
eqwfrwervjq_4-5-rgb_front and we are going to tighten it up
eqwfrwervjq_5-3-rgb_front now what you want to do here this is kind of important you want to take this first leg or one leg and you want to put it facing the inside of your drum set or facing where you are going to be sitting because when you hit it from that angle you do not want it to tip over
eqwfrwervjq_5-5-rgb_front now what you want to do here this is kind of important you want to take this first leg or one leg and you want to put it facing the inside of your drum set or facing where you are going to be sitting because when you hit it from that angle you do not want it to tip over
eqwfrwervjq_6-3-rgb_front see if you would hit it from here there is a possibility that it could tip
eqwfrwervjq_6-5-rgb_front see if you would hit it from here there is a possibility that it could tip
eqwfrwervjq_7-3-rgb_front so we set it there

fmsiqrdxabu_4-3-rgb_front we have got a custom layout here that goes right along with that hand drawn diagram
fmsiqrdxabu_5-3-rgb_front where we have taken a inch center to center spacing which is a inch opening between post and figured out what each how many sections would be on each side determining which post would be required and how many of each kind of post
fmsiqrdxabu_6-3-rgb_front with this diagram you can then prepare to lay out the job on the ground

a5ynwusiypa_12-3-rgb_front if going real light you want to to about ten to fifteen
a5ynwusiypa_12-5-rgb_front if going real light you want to to about ten to fifteen
a5ynwusiypa_13-3-rgb_front again the front squat you are going to concentrate a lot on the front part next to the knee cap to help develop those better
a5ynwusiypa_13-5-rgb_front again the front squat you are going to concentrate a lot on the front part next to the knee cap to help develop those better
a5ynwusiypa_14-3-rgb_front and that is how you perform the front squat

aubqwgdxame_1-3-rgb_front i think we pretty much fixed our leaky little problem in here
aubqwgdxame_2-3-rgb_front so what we did was we took this old housing off and replaced our old leaky cartridge which is this one with a brand new one
aubqwgdxame_3-3-rgb_front i think we have probably solved our problems
aubqwgdxame_4-3-rgb_front at this point is not going to be anymore leaks in this shower
aubqwgdxame_5-3-rgb_front again this is something that you can do at home
aubqwgdxame_6-3-rgb_front it is really not hard if you know the tricks and that is it for me today
abzrfn8xnga_1-3-rgb_front normally what i would do if i was doing a spell for healing is i would write out a petition
abzrfn8xnga_2-3-rgb_front and that would be almost like a prayer saying what i intend to do and for whom i intend to do it
abzrfn8xnga_3-3-rgb_front then i sometimes use a poppet as i had mentioned before and i wrap herbs around it
abzrfn8xnga_4-3-rgb_front or if say they had a broken leg i would concentrate the healing on the leg part
abzrfn8xnga_5-3-rgb_front sometimes what i do is i will take a photograph and put the photograph over the face so that it actually looks like the person
abzrfn8xnga_6-3-rgb_front that is called sympathetic magic
abzrfn8xnga_7-3-rgb_front where i am not actually doing the magic on somebody but i am doing it on something instead
abzrfn8xnga_8-3-rgb_front and then i would place it on the pentacle and i would continue with the spell saying what i would want for the healing and want for the person
abzrfn8xnga_9-3-rgb_front and of course for the highest good of all and that it harm none
afdfb8xx09w_0-3-rgb_front now we are going to be talking about direction of the ball
afdfb8xx09w_1-3-rgb_front basically you have two directions that we are going to be talking about
afdfb8xx09w_7-3-rgb_front for forehand on the line the same concept you are going to be hitting the ball
afdfb8xx09w_8-3-rgb_front you are going to hit it just a little more behind
ahjr2i50qew_0-3-rgb_front one thing as you notice we do not have any three point lines here but that was not always part of the game and this court was probably created during sometime during that period is the three point line
ahjr2i50qew_1-3-rgb_front the three point line is actually i talked about it earlier is nineteen point nine for college and high school and actually nba the nba line is a little further out it is at twenty three nine twenty three feet nine inches
ahjr2i50qew_10-3-rgb_front so same shooting mechanics apply and there you have it shooting the three point shot
ahjr2i50qew_2-3-rgb_front so whenever you are shooting same shooting mechanics apply
ahjr2i50qew_3-3-rgb_front you want to take your take your three point shot
ahjr2i50qew_4-3-rgb_front i am going to show you i am going to take actually go across court here and show you exactly what a round about what a three point shot would be being is how we do not have actually have a three point line on our court
ahjr2i50qew_5-3-rgb_front so check me out
ahjr2i50qew_6-3-rgb_front when you are coming over here and you are shooting a three point shot same shooting mechanics apply as a regular shot no changes you just might down here you probably want to shoot a jump shot unless you are strong enough to actually get it there with a set shot
ahjr2i50qew_7-3-rgb_front so when you are taking a taking your three point shot you want to make sure if you are playing outside outdoors you got to allot for the wind that is the thing about playing outside
ahjr2i50qew_8-3-rgb_front you have always got to allot for the wind
ahjr2i50qew_9-3-rgb_front so if you are taking this a little more distance so when you are shooting the three point shot you allot for the wind and there you go just like that you take the shot
aojdjktjkzw_0-3-rgb_front okay so our kimchi is pretty all mixed up now and when you are doing this at home you can really set this aside and let the pickling process happen for a good solid hour to a hour and you can see now already the different of the texture of the kimchi
aojdjktjkzw_1-3-rgb_front the cucumber is not stiff anymore i mean it would still break and when you eat it it has a nice crunch to it
aojdjktjkzw_2-3-rgb_front so once it is ready all we have to do is revisit our rice which is now done is the rice cooker
aojdjktjkzw_3-3-rgb_front spoon some of it wooden paddles work really well and then serve up some of our kimchi
aojdjktjkzw_4-3-rgb_front you can do it over the rice the side of the rice you can do it however you like and if you are really ambushes and you went to the asian market and got some kimchi traditional kimchi
aojdjktjkzw_5-3-rgb_front i am going to put that in to and there you have your basic korean meal vegetarian
at8baqq9jzy_1-3-rgb_front one of the ways that i like to continue to create my sound is i use what is called a loop station
at8baqq9jzy_2-3-rgb_front a loop station is basically a live recording its a xor input or a quarter inch input depending on what type of model you have that goes into the loop station and what you do is your press basically a peddle and it starts to record
at8baqq9jzy_3-3-rgb_front when you press the peddle again it starts to play what you just recorded live back to you and back to the audience and doing so you can create a mean sound with a lot of stuff layered on top of it
at8baqq9jzy_4-3-rgb_front it is very creative way to show people what your about to help facilitate really what your music is about and creating a sound on stage
at8baqq9jzy_5-3-rgb_front people really love it other musicians really dig it that is one way to broaden your musical horizons
b-mhbl3d2ec_1-3-rgb_front just trim off the little root section and peel off that outer brown skin now to chop an onion you want to leave that little root section on there
b-mhbl3d2ec_2-3-rgb_front and when you cut down to your onion you only cut in here you start there you do not want to cut the onion from here because then the whole onion falls apart if you start in this area and then slice down it will hold the onion together see how the onion stays together
b-mhbl3d2ec_3-3-rgb_front and then you can just slice straight across and you get a nice medium cut onion and then you can just at that point cut up the rest the roots section
b-mhbl3d2ec_4-3-rgb_front set that aside and then continue with our other onions just take off a little of that and peel it off and by keeping the onion together like this it helps to cut down on the amount of onion vapors you get to because your not chop chopping everywhere with the onions going everywhere it stays compacted and it is very quick to cut an onion like this
b-mhbl3d2ec_5-3-rgb_front just continue that with all your onions now i am going to show you how to peel and chop the garlic the easy way to get the skin off of the garlic is to take a flat a big knife a flat knife and just push with the palm of your hand to crush the garlic and the skin will fall right off
b-mhbl3d2ec_6-3-rgb_front another way to crush the garlic is to take a steardy glass or jar and just give that a little whack that also crush the garlic and the peel just comes right off i am just going to rough chop this garlic and add it to our onions next we will prep the leak
b9zjhvhgxyk_0-3-rgb_front my name is kristy i am working at the curves in west jordan utah
b9zjhvhgxyk_1-3-rgb_front we are talking about weight loss tips
b9zjhvhgxyk_10-3-rgb_front and there is different ways to we support our ladies through exercising three times a week
b9zjhvhgxyk_2-3-rgb_front a really good way to lose weight sometimes is a support group
b9zjhvhgxyk_3-3-rgb_front having friends to do it with you family members or even joining the support group
b9zjhvhgxyk_4-3-rgb_front at curves we do offer nutrition classes that is a group of ladies that are all the same goal we meet once a week and we talk about suggestions for each other
b9zjhvhgxyk_5-3-rgb_front tips on different salad dressings we have used that are lower fat that taste better
b9zjhvhgxyk_6-3-rgb_front just to have a group of women doing it with you or even friends or a spouse someone that is there to support you that knows what you are going through
b9zjhvhgxyk_7-3-rgb_front and can help you through it and you can help them
b9zjhvhgxyk_8-3-rgb_front so you know if you want to find one you can bring a friend if not if you do go to a facility like curves or other facilities they do offer support groups where you can do it with a group of friends and you can all lose weight together
b9zjhvhgxyk_9-3-rgb_front another part of our support group is we with these ladies on the wall they make a paper doll that resembles themselves and if they come to curves at least three times a week through the busy summer where a lot of people make it find it hard to work out they stay in our camp and we keep track of them call them let them know that we are they have not hit there three times a week that week
bbhyqcdp_9a_0-3-rgb_front when you are running a press the defense is running a press one thing that you want to learn how to do is break that press
bbhyqcdp_9a_1-3-rgb_front hi i am travis and i am about to teach you exactly how you can do that when you are on the basketball court
bbhyqcdp_9a_10-3-rgb_front once that is the key to breaking the press
bbhyqcdp_9a_11-3-rgb_front the press once a guard has the ball in the middle of the court the press is pretty much broken then the then the thing is finding someone to pass it to and getting it down court
bbhyqcdp_9a_12-3-rgb_front so try your best to get that person whoever is going to have the ball after it is inbound to get into the middle of the court so that they have options on the right and on their left
bbhyqcdp_9a_13-3-rgb_front once that happens there you have it breaking the press
bbhyqcdp_9a_2-3-rgb_front number one when there is a press a defensive press what you want to make sure you do is when you have the guy in the person inbound the ball you want to make sure that they have options
bbhyqcdp_9a_3-3-rgb_front somewhere back here so that when they get in trouble cause you do not want them out of bounds for five seconds when they get in trouble they can find someone to pass it to
bbhyqcdp_9a_4-3-rgb_front usually it will be you will have two guards you will have your point guard and your shooting guard back here
bbhyqcdp_9a_5-3-rgb_front and what they will do for each other is they will set screens and when he or she smacks the ball you will have them split to try to get open once the ball is inbound and they get the ball then that point guard or that shooting guard will take control of the game and look for their options
bbhyqcdp_9a_6-3-rgb_front now the two guards are back here you will have you may have the center all the way back or you may have the center somewhere closer to the top of the key on the opposite top of the key
bbhyqcdp_9a_7-3-rgb_front but you also want to have your forwards around half court so that they have so that your guards have options if they get in trouble
bbhyqcdp_9a_8-3-rgb_front now you want to make sure that you pass the half court line within within the time frame the ten second time frame but you want to also make sure that everybody is constantly moving cause you are breaking that press there is pressure there is going to be pressure that gets you that is what the press is
bbhyqcdp_9a_9-3-rgb_front so you want to have your offensive players down the court constantly moving and constantly setting screens for each other so they can get open
bhdxyjk977i_0-3-rgb_front next we are going to talk about is i am going to do a necklace and i am going to make a turquoise necklace since i have lots of turquoise here to choose from
bhdxyjk977i_1-3-rgb_front i am going to use a toggle clasp which has a circle and it also has an end piece here with a chain
bhdxyjk977i_10-3-rgb_front let s see what would look nice with the necklace and i think this one would look nice as a centerpiece
bhdxyjk977i_11-3-rgb_front that would look really good
bhdxyjk977i_12-3-rgb_front and what we will do is we will make a little bead go onto the end of this piece here to make it look like a little nice centerpiece
bhdxyjk977i_13-3-rgb_front there is the beads
bhdxyjk977i_14-3-rgb_front we will put it on the end here so that it will be a nice centerpiece for your necklace and this will be our design
bhdxyjk977i_15-3-rgb_front that will be the beginning of it
bhdxyjk977i_2-3-rgb_front so i am going to put this at the mark at eight so we can do a sixteen inch length necklace
bhdxyjk977i_3-3-rgb_front this is the type of bead i am going to use
bhdxyjk977i_4-3-rgb_front it s called a flat disk
bhdxyjk977i_5-3-rgb_front there is also this type but i am going to use this one today and drape it on here so we know exactly if it s going to be sixteen inches
bhdxyjk977i_6-3-rgb_front and most manufacturers when you buy your beads they come in sixteen inch length
bhdxyjk977i_7-3-rgb_front now because this is such a simple design here i thought maybe a little centerpiece would be nice
bhdxyjk977i_8-3-rgb_front so i was going through my large beads here and i was looking to see which one would match up nicely
bhdxyjk977i_9-3-rgb_front this one looks a little too blue here
biumw2dvw7q_0-3-rgb_front a wrist control that we can use from a slashing attack
biumw2dvw7q_1-3-rgb_front we are going to do it from the outside
biumw2dvw7q_10-3-rgb_front i am off the line of attack
biumw2dvw7q_11-3-rgb_front the blade is far enough away from me that if it misses it misses
biumw2dvw7q_12-3-rgb_front i am here
biumw2dvw7q_13-3-rgb_front i am here
biumw2dvw7q_14-3-rgb_front and then i control the hand
biumw2dvw7q_15-3-rgb_front he wants to bring it back naturally
biumw2dvw7q_16-3-rgb_front i will flow with him
biumw2dvw7q_17-3-rgb_front we do not want to get into a wrestling match
biumw2dvw7q_18-3-rgb_front i do not want to fight him down here to keep it here
biumw2dvw7q_19-3-rgb_front he want to bring it up
biumw2dvw7q_2-3-rgb_front we want to create a protective barrier once again
biumw2dvw7q_20-3-rgb_front that is fine
biumw2dvw7q_21-3-rgb_front i will go right with him
biumw2dvw7q_22-3-rgb_front boom
biumw2dvw7q_23-3-rgb_front we want to control the motion and use his energy against him as much as possible
biumw2dvw7q_24-3-rgb_front this motion is nice and small in an ever shrinking circle going gently past his forearm down into the ground
biumw2dvw7q_25-3-rgb_front i do not want to heave him yards away
biumw2dvw7q_26-3-rgb_front i want him on the ground at my feet as quickly as possible
biumw2dvw7q_27-3-rgb_front here and down we go to the ground
biumw2dvw7q_28-3-rgb_front and that is a good wrist control from a slashing attack
biumw2dvw7q_3_4_5-3-rgb_front create a diversionary framework a danny comes in here i want to follow that motion trap on top of the wrist right here and as he begins to pull back to get into position i want to follow him once again
biumw2dvw7q_6-3-rgb_front a technique we have seen several times before
biumw2dvw7q_7-3-rgb_front because it is exceptionally effective
biumw2dvw7q_8-3-rgb_front which is why we are seeing it again
biumw2dvw7q_9-3-rgb_front here i create my protective line
bufsn9gqscg_0-8-rgb_front i have some very good news for you about the feral cat
bufsn9gqscg_1-8-rgb_front the los angeles police department is now employing feral cats who otherwise would have been euphemized at shelters to fight rats and mice at two police stations one at the southeastern branch and the other the central branch
bufsn9gqscg_10-8-rgb_front very cute and of course people want to buy them they are turkish angoras
bufsn9gqscg_11-8-rgb_front the idea is that this research may actually lead to the cure of a human disease
bufsn9gqscg_12-8-rgb_front right now it is just a very cute idea
bufsn9gqscg_13-8-rgb_front and you know what i say to that
bufsn9gqscg_14-8-rgb_front meow meow meow
bufsn9gqscg_2-8-rgb_front and they report excellent success because once the mice and rats smell the presence of the cats they flee
bufsn9gqscg_3-8-rgb_front the cats do not even have to chase them
bufsn9gqscg_4-8-rgb_front and it is said that at parker center downtown la their main center are now going to enjoy having the feral cats drive out the rats there
bufsn9gqscg_5-8-rgb_front and you know i think this should be carried out around the country
bufsn9gqscg_6-8-rgb_front wherever there is a rat problem whether it be police departments or elsewhere because the feral cats do an excellent job and they would otherwise i am sorry to say be euphemized
bufsn9gqscg_7-8-rgb_front now from south korea we have another case of cats that is very interesting
bufsn9gqscg_8-8-rgb_front they have just cloned kitties
bufsn9gqscg_9-8-rgb_front yes they are giving them genes that make them glow in the dark when they are subjected to ultraviolet light
bx0zpf-regc_1-8-rgb_front tonight we are going to work and walk you through some advance bowling techniques so you can improve your game
bx0zpf-regc_2-8-rgb_front from the stand point tonight we have covered a lot of information
bx0zpf-regc_3-8-rgb_front we have talked basically about the stance we have talked about how to move the ball through the stance release position spare shooting how to change speed on the ball
bx0zpf-regc_4-8-rgb_front we have given you a lot of information from a stand point now it is time to take the information go out on the lanes and play with it
bb1z5dw4n-s_0-8-rgb_front now there are a few disadvantages to impromptu speaking
bb1z5dw4n-s_1-8-rgb_front the first one that you need to be aware of is that your audience could get bored alright
bb1z5dw4n-s_10-8-rgb_front and those are some of the negatives that are not such great things about impromptu speaking so just be aware of that when you are having to give an impromptu speech
bb1z5dw4n-s_11-8-rgb_front know that those are some of the pitfalls so that you might avoid them
bb1z5dw4n-s_2-8-rgb_front and a lot of this has to do with structure which i am going to talk about in a minute but you are thinking on your feet
bb1z5dw4n-s_3-8-rgb_front you know the topic but you have to while you are speaking impromptu with no preparation you have to keep your audience interested
bb1z5dw4n-s_4-8-rgb_front you can not ramble on you can not have random organizational patterns you have to keep the audience with you
bb1z5dw4n-s_5-8-rgb_front so that is something that you run the risk of is your audience not staying with you
bb1z5dw4n-s_6-8-rgb_front obviously your goal your aim is to appear effective as a public speaker giving a well speech
bb1z5dw4n-s_7-8-rgb_front well you are at a disadvantage if you are giving an impromptu speech because you are not giving a well speech you just met the topic
bb1z5dw4n-s_8-8-rgb_front so you have to try and present a well speech but you have to be careful because you have had no preparation time
bb1z5dw4n-s_9-8-rgb_front you also one of the negatives is that you can not really put a lot of attention on details have not had time to research you have not had time to come up with the finesse and the finite things about your speech so you are going to miss out on some of those details
bbskqke4ebs_0-8-rgb_front in this segment we are going to take a moment to talk about the benefits of qigong breathing
bbskqke4ebs_1-8-rgb_front the essence of all qigong exercises is in the exercise of the breath and although there is wonderful energetic reasons on why we do the particular qigong exercises we do i like to talk more about the western physiological reasons of why the belly breathing that we often times do is so beneficial
bbskqke4ebs_10-8-rgb_front will also be helping with all that shack neck and shoulder pain that we often get from stress breathing that we will talk about in the next segment
bbskqke4ebs_11-8-rgb_front so remember belly breathe is the way we are supposed to breathe
bbskqke4ebs_2-8-rgb_front one of the main reasons is the lymphatic system of our body
bbskqke4ebs_3-8-rgb_front the lymphatic system has two pumps
bbskqke4ebs_4-8-rgb_front one we get through exercise muscle contraction and the other one is through the action of the diaphragm the muscle that we are supposed to use in respiration
bbskqke4ebs_5-8-rgb_front the dome shaped muscle that is here right underneath our lungs and then when we breathe in it comes down and when we breathe out it comes up
bbskqke4ebs_6-8-rgb_front that action of the diaphragm actually moves two thirds of the lymphatic fluids of our body lymph being i hate to say it the gook of our body or the waste products of many of our body is systems
bbskqke4ebs_7-8-rgb_front so one of the best way we can do a cleanse or to feel better and more energized is just through breathing
bbskqke4ebs_8-8-rgb_front it has other benefits where in that it actually works towards helping regulate the ph of our blood which can be beneficial for preventing osteoporosis and so although the calcium in our bones is the primary way the breathing is the second most common way for our body to treat that
bbskqke4ebs_9-8-rgb_front so we can actually have benefits of preventing osteoporosis just by breathing properly
bcntuyh3gns_0-8-rgb_front i am veronyka bass from veronyka is color salon and day spa
bcntuyh3gns_2-8-rgb_front now we are going to have her lean back get comfortable
bcntuyh3gns_3-8-rgb_front and this is where we are going to use the warm water
bcntuyh3gns_4-8-rgb_front more on the warm side than not hot or cold
bcntuyh3gns_5-8-rgb_front so we are going to get ready to shampoo her and at the very end of a shampoo it is nice to give it a cold rinse so it seals the cuticle
bcntuyh3gns_6-8-rgb_front alot of people do not realize that
bcntuyh3gns_7-8-rgb_front it is going to be a little bit of a cold shower but it seals the cuticle
bcntuyh3gns_8-8-rgb_front now i am getting ready to use our shampoo to bring the ph balance down
bcntuyh3gns_9-8-rgb_front this will stop the total continuation of processing
bjviidywc-k_1-8-rgb_front right now we are going to discuss choosing the right paint for your project
bjviidywc-k_2-8-rgb_front what i have here in my hand is a paint wheel
bjviidywc-k_3-8-rgb_front it gives the different colors that independent stores would offer
bjviidywc-k_4-8-rgb_front so you can have specific selections to choose from
bjviidywc-k_5-8-rgb_front depending upon the application you are going to either want to get a flat a eggshell a satin gloss all that can be done regardless of your color chooses
bjviidywc-k_6-8-rgb_front personally i would put a gloss or a on your doors and eggshells or a satin on your walls
bjviidywc-k_7-8-rgb_front you can use flat to go along your ceilings or you can use a satin finish for that as well
bjviidywc-k_8-8-rgb_front the reason for this for the different changes is to bring out the different colors the different textures and also the ability and clean ability
bjviidywc-k_9-8-rgb_front a higher gloss paint is going to give you a more cleanable surface or as a flat paint is not easily as clean
bpoksl0oiiw_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to be learning how to play portal a game by valve software
bpoksl0oiiw_10-8-rgb_front the sort of toxic goo that you would not want to find yourself in
bpoksl0oiiw_11-8-rgb_front so we want to avoid hitting the floor of test chamber at all costs
bpoksl0oiiw_12-8-rgb_front we look over here on our left we have got a power ball dispenser and an orange portal and a power conduit
bpoksl0oiiw_13-8-rgb_front what we need to do is find a way to get the power ball over to the conduit and that will activate this elevator and let us get to the exit
bpoksl0oiiw_14-8-rgb_front but we need to be careful because if we come out of this orange portal and get hit by the power ball we will die
bpoksl0oiiw_15-8-rgb_front so we need to find a different way of doing things
bpoksl0oiiw_2-8-rgb_front a company with which i have no affiliation
bpoksl0oiiw_3-8-rgb_front all right
bpoksl0oiiw_4-8-rgb_front here we are in test chamber
bpoksl0oiiw_5-8-rgb_front we have got some new icons here now
bpoksl0oiiw_6-8-rgb_front we have got the old familiar power ball death power ball power conduit and now it looks like we have got some other ones
bpoksl0oiiw_7-8-rgb_front the risk of drowning and do not drink the water
bpoksl0oiiw_8-8-rgb_front so we look here in test chamber
bpoksl0oiiw_9-8-rgb_front we can see that the floor is actually sort of toxic goo
cdjuwtdyasg_0-8-rgb_front alright the drink that we are about to make is a black and tan
cdjuwtdyasg_1-8-rgb_front now there is a lot of debate on what two beers are supposed to be used for a black and tan
cdjuwtdyasg_10-8-rgb_front so anytime you want to spice up your guinness a little bit and you do not feel like having just a bask make yourself a black and tan a mixture of both
cdjuwtdyasg_11-8-rgb_front bottoms up
cdjuwtdyasg_2-8-rgb_front but if you ask most people they will tell you that guinness and bask ale
cdjuwtdyasg_3-8-rgb_front first thing we are going to do is we are going to take a pint glass and start by pouring in your bask half way
cdjuwtdyasg_4-8-rgb_front and we are going to fill it the rest of the way with guinness
cdjuwtdyasg_5-8-rgb_front and the guinness is darker
cdjuwtdyasg_6-8-rgb_front you will see the difference in the top and the bottom
cdjuwtdyasg_7-8-rgb_front it should have a nice distinction between that and let is get a close up so you can see
cdjuwtdyasg_8-8-rgb_front and the top should be a little bit darker than the bottom
cdjuwtdyasg_9-8-rgb_front and that is a black and tan
chfw_u9e4sm_0-8-rgb_front the next point you are going to use for the lower legs especially is inner courtyard or stomach
chfw_u9e4sm_1-8-rgb_front and this one is really easy to find it is literally between the second and third toe
chfw_u9e4sm_2-8-rgb_front so you are just going to rub in between the toes
chfw_u9e4sm_3-8-rgb_front just run your finger in there massage in between the toes and this is another good one for dispersing pain relaxing the muscles and dogs like to generally have their feet massaged by their owners they do not like them touched by the vets much but quite often they will let the owners do just about anything
chfw_u9e4sm_4-8-rgb_front you can do a full foot massage on them if you like
chfw_u9e4sm_5-8-rgb_front there is good acupressure points in between the other toes as well but this one specifically for muscle stiffness and pain in the back limbs
chfw_u9e4sm_6-8-rgb_front so you will want to work that one and again do both sides because quite often if this knee is hurting he is compensating by using this leg
chfw_u9e4sm_7-8-rgb_front so you are causing discomfort and stiffness in both legs
chfw_u9e4sm_8-8-rgb_front you want to work that point
chfw_u9e4sm_9-8-rgb_front again this is a massage just rubbing that muscle between your fingers the tissues between your fingers and really rub that fairly hard feel that skin move around so that you know that you are getting some real movement in the area
cocnndl5fwi_1-8-rgb_front i am here to discuss short curly locks with you
cocnndl5fwi_10-8-rgb_front now heather has very fine hair and this goes to extra hot
cocnndl5fwi_11-8-rgb_front she is not going to need something extra hot in order to go on her hair so you can actually bring it down to maybe your highs speed or high temperature
cocnndl5fwi_12-8-rgb_front the courser your hair is the hotter the most you would likely need your thermal styling tool to be in order to really work on your hair
cocnndl5fwi_13-8-rgb_front now if i grab this the softer the curl is the better it would be especially you can see when they are going to fall
cocnndl5fwi_14-8-rgb_front so you can see that the curl is very tight very wiggly
cocnndl5fwi_15-8-rgb_front that is what you want when you are working with shorter hair especially fine and straight hair
cocnndl5fwi_16-8-rgb_front it is going to help achieve your style and it is going to help you maintain your movement maintaining your curl and also add some volume
cocnndl5fwi_2-8-rgb_front the tools that you are going to want to use to create a curl can consist of thermal styling tools which is ultimately your curling iron
cocnndl5fwi_3-8-rgb_front curling irons come in various diameters they come very small they go to the and then the
cocnndl5fwi_4-8-rgb_front the longer the larger the diameter the looser the weight is going to be
cocnndl5fwi_5-8-rgb_front now when somebody like heather is hair you also must take into consideration the length of her hair
cocnndl5fwi_6-8-rgb_front if i was to use this on this section it would only do one turn it would be very very loose and it would literally use something like this on shorter hair just to kind to give it a little bevel around the face
cocnndl5fwi_7-8-rgb_front just to really kind to get the hair to either go under or flip out the smaller diameter will work best on her hair
cocnndl5fwi_8-8-rgb_front another great benefit with curling irons such as this one is does have a heat adjustment on it
cocnndl5fwi_9-8-rgb_front the heat adjustment will allow for you to adjust the heat to order to cater to your hair
cs44xaczy7a_0-8-rgb_front we are now going to start lunging the horse
cs44xaczy7a_1-8-rgb_front you will notice that i still have the chain over my nose
cs44xaczy7a_2-8-rgb_front this just gives me a little bit more control
cs44xaczy7a_3-8-rgb_front i also have put on a pair of gloves and this is a really important thing to do to protect your hands from getting burned if your horse decides he does not want to behave and stay on the circle
cs44xaczy7a_4-8-rgb_front it also lets you grip the lunge line a little bit better
cs44xaczy7a_5-8-rgb_front i also have a lunge whip and this is an important tool in order for us to communicate that we want our horse to go forward and we are also in an enclosed arena
cs44xaczy7a_6-8-rgb_front so that if something does go wrong he can not get out
cs44xaczy7a_7-8-rgb_front so i am going to start by just letting him come into a small circle around me

cw5evdzibb4_3-8-rgb_front so molinia do you care to demonstrate with me
cw5evdzibb4_4-8-rgb_front i am going to first have you sit up great
cw5evdzibb4_5-8-rgb_front so when the individual gets on the table first we have them sit on the side
cw5evdzibb4_6-8-rgb_front can you swing your legs around
cw5evdzibb4_7-8-rgb_front there you go
cw5evdzibb4_8-8-rgb_front so they first get on the table like this and then we have them swing their legs onto the table great
cw5evdzibb4_9-8-rgb_front then slowly lower yourself supporting her back and her head
cwljfxff9ks_0-8-rgb_front the principles of aikido can be applied to daily life in many different situations
cwljfxff9ks_1-8-rgb_front it can be applied in your family with your spouse with your kids
cwljfxff9ks_10-8-rgb_front in that that last technique as phil comes in and attacks we enter and we face the same direction
cwljfxff9ks_11-8-rgb_front we can see exactly what they are seeing
cwljfxff9ks_12-8-rgb_front we can get a little different perspective
cwljfxff9ks_13-8-rgb_front if we think that we need to deal with the situation a little bit more directly we can just go off the attack immediately
cwljfxff9ks_14-8-rgb_front as he attacks just turn and go right in
cwljfxff9ks_15-8-rgb_front everything is blending and harmonizing
cwljfxff9ks_16-8-rgb_front some can be a little more direct
cwljfxff9ks_17-8-rgb_front others can just not connect with that energy
cwljfxff9ks_18-8-rgb_front if it is negative energy or anger or frustration you do not need to deal with it
cwljfxff9ks_19-8-rgb_front there are many different ways as you can see to deal with each individual situation and aikido principles will help you deal with that in daily life
cwljfxff9ks_2-8-rgb_front it can be applied at work with an irate boss or
cwljfxff9ks_3-8-rgb_front it could be an upset driver
cwljfxff9ks_4-8-rgb_front it could be somebody with road rage
cwljfxff9ks_5-8-rgb_front we are going to demonstrate a couple of different techniques to emphasize the principles and why do not we just take a peek
cwljfxff9ks_6-8-rgb_front for example if there is somebody coming at you with road rage it is probably best not to block not to stop them with your car but just to let them go right by and with aikido it looks something like this
cwljfxff9ks_7-8-rgb_front i will show you
cwljfxff9ks_8-8-rgb_front so that is one way you can just let them go right by
cwljfxff9ks_9-8-rgb_front if you need to deal with the situation a little bit more it might look something like this
cxw8hfcwjlq_1-8-rgb_front this yogurt is a bulgarian yogurt that is non fat so it really healthy it is a little more on the sour side as far as yogurts go and most middle eastern yogurt is kind of sour
cxw8hfcwjlq_10-8-rgb_front i will definitely recommend getting this kind of yogurt so so good
cxw8hfcwjlq_11-8-rgb_front yogurt in the middle east is kind of like ketchup here in the united states so and that is it for the yogurt part of the hummus
cxw8hfcwjlq_2-8-rgb_front i would recommend using the middle eastern yogurt if you can on the hummus because this taste more better then the regular yogurt that you get in heb
cxw8hfcwjlq_3-8-rgb_front you can usually find this at heb but if cant go to your middle eastern store and they would have yogurt and you just want to add about tablespoons to your hummus
cxw8hfcwjlq_4-8-rgb_front not only this gives it a great flavor but it also makes the hummus a little liquidly and not as chunky as it would be if it did not have this
cxw8hfcwjlq_5-8-rgb_front a lot of people use olive oil in there hummus to make it a lot thinner then what it usually is because when you grind up all these garbanzo beans it comes out kind chunky
cxw8hfcwjlq_6-8-rgb_front it is a lot better to get it more puree that way it has a better texture to it
cxw8hfcwjlq_7-8-rgb_front this yogurt as i said is non fat it also comes in a version that is not non fat that you can pick which ever one you like but it is definitely very good yogurt
cxw8hfcwjlq_8-8-rgb_front this one right here is my favorite and i think it is whitemountainfoods
cxw8hfcwjlq_9-8-rgb_front com you can go and order this
diimhox5ad8_0-8-rgb_front now that we have covered walking properly lets work on focusing on one point so we are actually moving up the body as we go
diimhox5ad8_1-8-rgb_front one point if you could look the center of mass is going to be bellybutton anywhere from to inches down depending so right about where this belt is
diimhox5ad8_10-8-rgb_front and we will continue on this subject shortly thereafter
diimhox5ad8_2-8-rgb_front now one point is the principal of dynamic motion without actual visible motion taking place
diimhox5ad8_3-8-rgb_front one way of thinking of it is that if you have somebody it is tensile strength
diimhox5ad8_4-8-rgb_front and if you have somebody grab onto your arm they are out to be a living breathing connection that yes they are it feels very strong it feels like a fire hose
diimhox5ad8_5-8-rgb_front a fire hose is almost impossible to bend when water is flowing through it
diimhox5ad8_6-8-rgb_front it is a living entity and therefore one point is very much the same thing it is a living entity
diimhox5ad8_7-8-rgb_front and you are looking for that constant relaxed natural power of tensile strength
diimhox5ad8_8-8-rgb_front it is not muscular by any means and it is certainly not structural but there is well i should not say that because there is an aspect of structural to it
diimhox5ad8_9-8-rgb_front with correct structure and correct relaxation you build on tensile strength
dkumozqvk3m_0-8-rgb_front hello this is jb i am with austin homebrew supply in austin texas
dkumozqvk3m_1-8-rgb_front talking to you today about equipment and process and ingredients that go into making your own beer at your own home
dkumozqvk3m_10-8-rgb_front subsequently it is food grade
dkumozqvk3m_11-8-rgb_front in other words there is no way that any kind of oil and or internal petroleums or lubricants can contact the beer or wine that you are moving through here
dkumozqvk3m_12-8-rgb_front so
dkumozqvk3m_13-8-rgb_front these guys are called food grade pumps
dkumozqvk3m_14-8-rgb_front they are made by a company called march and these guys do a great job of moving hot boiling wort or beer from point a to point b without you having to pick up big kettles full of hot broiling liquid
dkumozqvk3m_15-8-rgb_front so
dkumozqvk3m_16-8-rgb_front food grade pumps really come in handy when you are brewing
dkumozqvk3m_2-8-rgb_front or wine or cider or socky
dkumozqvk3m_3-8-rgb_front you got a lot of different things you can make here
dkumozqvk3m_4-8-rgb_front so
dkumozqvk3m_5-8-rgb_front one of the things you want to do at the end of or during the process of either making beer especially beer making or even wine is you need to rack or transfer we had some strange terminology here but racking means to transfer from point a to point b
dkumozqvk3m_6-8-rgb_front so especially in beer making a lot of time you are moving hot liquids from one point to another especially if you want to take a hot liquid from a low point and take it to a higher point
dkumozqvk3m_7-8-rgb_front well it is going to be a real difficult to pick up a boiling hot container of liquid and move it
dkumozqvk3m_8-8-rgb_front so so that being said we carry food grade pumps that the reason they are food grade is there is a space between where the motor hosing is the actual pump drive with the magnetic drive between so
dkumozqvk3m_9-8-rgb_front there is a complete difference between the motor and where the actual liquid comes through
dqjydm9pkr8_0-8-rgb_front effleurage is a massage stroke that basically just stroking the horse
dqjydm9pkr8_1-8-rgb_front you can do it either with your hands with your fingers closed and just stroking down the side of the horse keeping one hand on the horse all the time while you are doing it
dqjydm9pkr8_2-8-rgb_front or you can have your fingers more open in sort of a combed shape the stroking down the side of the horse starting at the poll and working all the way back
dqjydm9pkr8_3-8-rgb_front that is actually a fairly safe stroke to use either form of effleurage horse is most likely you know almost always enjoy it
dqjydm9pkr8_4-8-rgb_front they do not find it to be too invasive it is not going to be uncomfortable for them and the unless you are being careless it is a fairly safe stroke to be using
dqjydm9pkr8_5-8-rgb_front so again i am talking about having your hands either with your fingers open like this and just kind of combing on the horse or having your fingers closed and stroking down the sides of the horse
dqjydm9pkr8_6-8-rgb_front and just petting them
dqjydm9pkr8_7-8-rgb_front it is a nice gentle stroke it helps them to relax
dwotjxrh_ww_0-8-rgb_front i am tim gipson and i am going to talk to you about trouble shooting your refrigerator
dwotjxrh_ww_1-8-rgb_front now if you do not have any power at all to your refrigerator first few things you want to check is you want to check and make sure that the breaker is not tripped in your main breaker box
dwotjxrh_ww_10-8-rgb_front recommended settings are anywhere from about degrees to degrees depending on really how cold you like to keep some of your products particularly dairy products
dwotjxrh_ww_11-8-rgb_front then the other side here on the freezer side some of the common things you can run in to is whether your ice maker is not distributing ice properly or your water is not coming out
dwotjxrh_ww_12-8-rgb_front now if water is not coming out most of these are equipped with a filter so in this case this one tells you when it is time to start thinking about ordering a filter and it tells you when to replace it
dwotjxrh_ww_13-8-rgb_front on the ice occasionally you may just need to come in here where these are frost free freezers this can actually warm up or some of your ice melts together and the agitating arm can actually get stuck
dwotjxrh_ww_14-8-rgb_front so you want to come in here and break up your ice occasionally
dwotjxrh_ww_15-8-rgb_front so i am tim gipson and that is some trouble shooting tips for your refrigerator
dwotjxrh_ww_2-8-rgb_front so you want to locate where that is and you want to check the breaker and make sure it is reset
dwotjxrh_ww_3-8-rgb_front if it is popped you want to make sure you reset it to the on position
dwotjxrh_ww_4-8-rgb_front the next thing would be to check the power chord behind the refrigerator and make sure it has not come loose from the outlet
dwotjxrh_ww_5-8-rgb_front so that is basically on the power
dwotjxrh_ww_6-8-rgb_front now if you still are not do not have power you may need to consult a professional repair service at that point because there could be something internal to the refrigerator
dwotjxrh_ww_7-8-rgb_front now this particular refrigerator it has all electronic controls so it has its own sensors which really tell you what is going on
dwotjxrh_ww_8-8-rgb_front this particular model up here if you have some food that may not be staying cool enough you might check your temperature controls
dwotjxrh_ww_9-8-rgb_front this particular model actually tells you what the degrees are set to
d_0dt3vdyco_0-8-rgb_front in tennis a lot of times you are going to get shots that are not standardized that you are not really prepared for unless you play a lot
d_0dt3vdyco_1-8-rgb_front and the half volley is one of those shots
d_0dt3vdyco_10-8-rgb_front he is just going to block it forward as he comes to the net
d_0dt3vdyco_11-8-rgb_front so it is just a way of taking a ball
d_0dt3vdyco_12-8-rgb_front you are not really doing much with it
d_0dt3vdyco_13-8-rgb_front you are just blocking it forward
d_0dt3vdyco_14-8-rgb_front now john mcenroe was a master of this shot
d_0dt3vdyco_15-8-rgb_front but you have to have it
d_0dt3vdyco_16-8-rgb_front it is very apropos in doubles that you are able to block the ball back because if they volley it at your feet you have just got to be able to block it right back
d_0dt3vdyco_17-8-rgb_front so what you want to do is just use a whole basket of balls
d_0dt3vdyco_18-8-rgb_front see how many in a row you can make
d_0dt3vdyco_19-8-rgb_front see how many out of you can make and as the number of balls in practice improves your results on the court are also going to improve
d_0dt3vdyco_2-8-rgb_front so here is a drill that helps you get the half volley
d_0dt3vdyco_3-8-rgb_front you can use a wall which is great
d_0dt3vdyco_4-8-rgb_front but in this case your practice partner in this case it will be me i will be throwing the ball to darren
d_0dt3vdyco_5-8-rgb_front so imagine that you have hit a nice shot you are coming to the net or you have hit a nice serve you are coming to the net and your opponent hits a ball that drops by your feet
d_0dt3vdyco_6-8-rgb_front it bounces up and you have got to just block it forward
d_0dt3vdyco_7-8-rgb_front so that is what this drill is
d_0dt3vdyco_8-8-rgb_front so darren is going to demonstrate
d_0dt3vdyco_9-8-rgb_front i am going to throw it by his feet
d_v_k6ziina_0-8-rgb_front knots have a long and varied history throughout time and today i am going to show you how to make one of the great ones
d_v_k6ziina_1-8-rgb_front my name is robert segundo and i am going to teach you how to make a clove hitch
d_v_k6ziina_10-8-rgb_front i mean you can hold things with it
d_v_k6ziina_11-8-rgb_front you can not put a whole lot of tension on it because it will slip through
d_v_k6ziina_12-8-rgb_front but it is good enough if you are just trying to hold some items down
d_v_k6ziina_13-8-rgb_front let is do that one more time
d_v_k6ziina_14-8-rgb_front let is pull this up and out like so
d_v_k6ziina_15-8-rgb_front once again we will go over we will go under over our standing end
d_v_k6ziina_16-8-rgb_front and we will go over like so back under and through the loop we have created and there it is
d_v_k6ziina_17-8-rgb_front there is our clove hitch
d_v_k6ziina_18-8-rgb_front my name is robert segundo and enjoy tying knots
d_v_k6ziina_2-8-rgb_front now a hitch technically is not a knot but it falls in the same category of kind of the macrame style
d_v_k6ziina_3-8-rgb_front so what we are going to do is we are going to look down to our table here and we can see i have my rod here that i am going to attach my line to
d_v_k6ziina_4-8-rgb_front what i am going to do is i am going to take my line initially i am going to roll it up and over and then bring it under like so
d_v_k6ziina_5-8-rgb_front then it is going to go over the standing end that was there and i am going to take my working end back up and over
d_v_k6ziina_6-8-rgb_front and it is going to come under and then back through the loop like so
d_v_k6ziina_7-8-rgb_front there you go
d_v_k6ziina_8-8-rgb_front this is basically two put together and this is just a clove hitch
d_v_k6ziina_9-8-rgb_front and it is really tight
elv9uhs89iq_0_1-8-rgb_front hello have you ever wondered how to prepare for a divorce well i am dr felicia and i would like to share a few tips with you
elv9uhs89iq_10-8-rgb_front if you have children you need to prepare if you are going to have to move and assign them into new schools get them registered
elv9uhs89iq_11-8-rgb_front you may need to actually enlist family support for child care
elv9uhs89iq_12-8-rgb_front you may need to get all kinds of clothing sorted out in terms of who keeps what belongings and personal belongings in the house who keeps what
elv9uhs89iq_13-8-rgb_front and if you are the caretaker of the children you obviously need more than the party who is going to leave without the children
elv9uhs89iq_14-8-rgb_front in either case i wish you good luck
elv9uhs89iq_15-8-rgb_front and remember it is how to prepare and survive for divorce is never easy
elv9uhs89iq_16-8-rgb_front good luck dr felicia goodbye
elv9uhs89iq_2-8-rgb_front preparing for divorce is a very scary and frightening prospect whether you are the male or the female in the relationship
elv9uhs89iq_3-8-rgb_front one of the things you want to consider especially if you are the female is that for instance today most court jurisdictions only allow about three years alimony for rehabilitation
elv9uhs89iq_4-8-rgb_front so if the partner wanted to go back to school and be that is give them three years time in preparation
elv9uhs89iq_5-8-rgb_front so that is a pretty frightening prospect in itself
elv9uhs89iq_6-8-rgb_front if you already had a career and you are in a working world it is not as quite as frightening but chances are your assets are pretty well divided and you are going to need to start to secure some new aspects for yourself
elv9uhs89iq_7-8-rgb_front you want to decide if keeping the house is in your best interest or perhaps the expenses to run the house are just so expensive it is not worth it
elv9uhs89iq_8-8-rgb_front you may wish to downsize and put yourself into a situation where you can readily afford it on one person is pay
elv9uhs89iq_9-8-rgb_front the other thing that you want to prepare for is housing
eriohdeskne_0-8-rgb_front alright we have just completed our two flowers
eriohdeskne_1-8-rgb_front they have been clear embossed and then they have been embossed with glassy glaze and now what i am going to do is i am going to make a center for each of these flower
eriohdeskne_10-8-rgb_front and just push the chipboard back a little bit if you do not have enough room
eriohdeskne_11-8-rgb_front alright now we are ready to give this another squeeze and finish that eyelet
eriohdeskne_12-8-rgb_front alright
eriohdeskne_13-8-rgb_front and then the little one same thing
eriohdeskne_14-8-rgb_front alright now we want to hang this off the wreath so i am going to need a smaller hole
eriohdeskne_15-8-rgb_front i need a so i am going to just poke a hole at the tip of the leaf there and at the tip of the leaf there
eriohdeskne_16-8-rgb_front and i am going to be using some natural hemp twine to tie this on to my wreath
eriohdeskne_17-8-rgb_front i chose the natural hemp twine because the wreath that i have chosen is the grapevine wreath and you can see i have embossed and glassy glazed a variety of flowers
eriohdeskne_18-8-rgb_front i have attached them with the hemp twine and then i have tied it altogether with the wide certainly sally or gross grain ribbon to make a beautiful wreath that your mom will be proud to hang on her front door
eriohdeskne_2-8-rgb_front and i am using the jumbo eyelets in my cropodile and i am just going to go ahead to the middle of that flower using the punch
eriohdeskne_3-8-rgb_front punch it out and do the same thing with the smaller flower
eriohdeskne_4-8-rgb_front punch that out
eriohdeskne_5-8-rgb_front and i am going to be using the pewter eyelets
eriohdeskne_6-8-rgb_front and i am just going to push down
eriohdeskne_7-8-rgb_front and sometimes if you are not lined up quite right if you lay it on its front you can push it down a little bit better
eriohdeskne_8-8-rgb_front there is one
eriohdeskne_9-8-rgb_front and now the second one
ey32ru3nstc_0-8-rgb_front i am going to show you how to make a razberi sunsplash a wonderfully fruity cocktail
ey32ru3nstc_1-8-rgb_front we are going to start off with our ice
ey32ru3nstc_10-8-rgb_front then we are going to add in two splashes of grenadine
ey32ru3nstc_11-8-rgb_front uno dos like so
ey32ru3nstc_12-8-rgb_front and about an ounce of orange juice yum
ey32ru3nstc_13-8-rgb_front and then we are going to fill it the rest of the way with pineapple juice
ey32ru3nstc_14-8-rgb_front so this is going to be so wonderfully tropical
ey32ru3nstc_15-8-rgb_front hence the name sunsplash
ey32ru3nstc_16-8-rgb_front go ahead and shake it up
ey32ru3nstc_17-8-rgb_front and if you have a hurricane glass great
ey32ru3nstc_18-8-rgb_front if not you can also serve this in a highball glass
ey32ru3nstc_19-8-rgb_front garnish it with a cherry and there you have it razberi sunsplash
ey32ru3nstc_2-8-rgb_front just like so
ey32ru3nstc_20-8-rgb_front cheers
ey32ru3nstc_3-8-rgb_front pour that into your glass and then we are going to add to that three fourths of an ounce of coconut rum any brand will do so choose your favorite
ey32ru3nstc_4-8-rgb_front you are the one drinking it and i want you to like it
ey32ru3nstc_5-8-rgb_front we are then going to add of an ounce of raspberry liqueur
ey32ru3nstc_6-8-rgb_front just like so
ey32ru3nstc_7-8-rgb_front that is going to give it a wonderful fruity flavor
ey32ru3nstc_8-8-rgb_front as is our peachtree schnapps
ey32ru3nstc_9-8-rgb_front also of an ounce so equal parts
eahjyz2685g_0-8-rgb_front now another important thing for you to remember and this is going to be a little difficult because we all tend to like to please people we all tend to like accolades and praise
eahjyz2685g_1-8-rgb_front but it is very important that you remember everyone does not have to love your speech
eahjyz2685g_10-8-rgb_front well the last time i did that speech everybody hated it
eahjyz2685g_11-8-rgb_front or everybody said i was bad
eahjyz2685g_12-8-rgb_front past failures of people not liking your speech or not liking you have nothing to do with present and future presentations
eahjyz2685g_13-8-rgb_front maybe that happened before
eahjyz2685g_14-8-rgb_front ok so what
eahjyz2685g_15-8-rgb_front move on
eahjyz2685g_16-8-rgb_front it will not happen this time just because it happened last time
eahjyz2685g_2-8-rgb_front everyone does not have to love you
eahjyz2685g_3-8-rgb_front i found that out many many years ago as a college professor when i used to try to please all of my students
eahjyz2685g_4-8-rgb_front and invariably i would have one or maybe two a semester that just they just did not like me
eahjyz2685g_5-8-rgb_front it did not matter what i did they did not like me
eahjyz2685g_6-8-rgb_front and that was ok
eahjyz2685g_7-8-rgb_front it is ok if one or two people disagree with your speech
eahjyz2685g_8-8-rgb_front it is ok if one or two or three people do not like you
eahjyz2685g_9-8-rgb_front you have to continue to allow that to be ok you also have to take a look at past failures as a speaker
f-mvu_dzvjg_1-8-rgb_front a big misconception is that if your dog is tale is waging is that he is happy
f-mvu_dzvjg_10-8-rgb_front so it is ok for dogs to look and be curious but if they get that intense obssessive stare then it is going to be threatened
f-mvu_dzvjg_2-8-rgb_front alot of dogs wag their tales when they are ready to attack as well so the big thing to notice is where your dog is tail is
f-mvu_dzvjg_3-8-rgb_front like if his tail is tucked then he is afraid and you should not be petting him at that time and you should not be petting him at that time
f-mvu_dzvjg_4-8-rgb_front you never pet a dog when he is afraid because that will make him more afraid
f-mvu_dzvjg_5-8-rgb_front if it is laying loosey like this this is just normal
f-mvu_dzvjg_6-8-rgb_front when he is waging his tail and it is out here in the middle that means he is happy that is a normal state of mind
f-mvu_dzvjg_7-8-rgb_front when the tail starts to go up and it starts to wag like this your dog is probably in a more aggressive state of mind
f-mvu_dzvjg_8-8-rgb_front another thing about dogs when you are walking them you will see their ears perk up if their ears perk up that is them paying more attention
f-mvu_dzvjg_9-8-rgb_front but you can see a lot of times that they will get this intense stare when they are fixating on something and when they are fixating on something that is when you need to correct them because that is them being obsessed with that object whether it be a person or another dog or anything like that
f5egpzgscjs_0-8-rgb_front today we are going to talk about how to diagnose an ailment of your fish
f5egpzgscjs_1-8-rgb_front part of keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them everyday
f5egpzgscjs_10-8-rgb_front simply follow directions and it tells you exactly how much to use when you should do a water change
f5egpzgscjs_11-8-rgb_front another thing that you can put in your tank is aquarium salt
f5egpzgscjs_12-8-rgb_front aquarium salt raises the electrolytes in the tank and it also helps reduce stress
f5egpzgscjs_13-8-rgb_front my name is michael and today we are talking about how to diagnose an ailment
f5egpzgscjs_2-8-rgb_front when we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn they are not in rough shape they are not sitting at the bottom
f5egpzgscjs_3-8-rgb_front once you have been keeping your fish for a while you are going to know if they are acting different
f5egpzgscjs_4-8-rgb_front a common problem with fish is ick which is tiny white spots over the entire fish itself
f5egpzgscjs_5-8-rgb_front a lot of ailments are caused by stress which can be water quality temperature and fish stressing out other fish themselves
f5egpzgscjs_6-8-rgb_front one thing that i like to start with if there is a regular ailment going on is using a natural product
f5egpzgscjs_7_8_9-8-rgb_front we have melafix and pemefix melafix is an and pemefix is an what i like to do is use both of them together because its not an exact science of exactly what is going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well
fe6xxsbjvv8_1-8-rgb_front if there is clay on here what happens is as you come down here and you start taking the clay off the pot see if i do not keep cleaning that tool off all it does is keep going round and round and round
fe6xxsbjvv8_10-8-rgb_front clean it off you have got a lot of time
fe6xxsbjvv8_11-8-rgb_front so you have a nice smoothed out bottom down there
fe6xxsbjvv8_12-8-rgb_front that is it
fe6xxsbjvv8_2-8-rgb_front sometimes it sticks to your pot sometimes it does not
fe6xxsbjvv8_3-8-rgb_front so when you get clay on your tool any tool for that matter clean it off set it aside
fe6xxsbjvv8_4-8-rgb_front so you start with a nice clean tool so that as you take your tool touch your piece remember this is still kind of sticky your clay trimmings do not transfer from your tool back onto your pot
fe6xxsbjvv8_5-8-rgb_front you are trying to get it off of your pot
fe6xxsbjvv8_6-8-rgb_front so we are going to come down in here again clean some more of that off
fe6xxsbjvv8_7-8-rgb_front see how you have that all down there
fe6xxsbjvv8_8-8-rgb_front you have to clean this off
fe6xxsbjvv8_9-8-rgb_front sometimes you just get little pieces of clay
fslsm4mqbbe_0-8-rgb_front next we are going to be talking about the edge of a snowboard
fslsm4mqbbe_1-8-rgb_front the edge is this metal piece that wraps around the board completely depending on the type of board
fslsm4mqbbe_2-8-rgb_front typically with the freestyle board it would have complete wrap around the free ride board would have a complete wrap around an all mountain board would have a complete wrap around but as you got to a jib and rail board that is where it might differ
fslsm4mqbbe_3-8-rgb_front on a jib and rail board towards the center of the board there would either be an indentation on the rail or no rail at all on the entire board
fslsm4mqbbe_4-8-rgb_front the only other exception to the rule is the sidewall which is a seven tooth serrated edge that looks something like this on either side of the board and what that is to do is it is literally supposed to cut into ice
fslsm4mqbbe_5-8-rgb_front if you were to have a sidewall like this it might just shave off a nice top layer of it but with a serrated edge you can cut right into it and do better turns
fux-zuwyx2q_1-8-rgb_front and now we are going to go over fireball
fux-zuwyx2q_10-8-rgb_front but you have also got to realize that that x divided evenly rounded down amongst the number of targets
fux-zuwyx2q_2-8-rgb_front fireball is a very staple of the red series of this game
fux-zuwyx2q_3-8-rgb_front it is x and a red much like blaze
fux-zuwyx2q_4-8-rgb_front however fireball is a little different
fux-zuwyx2q_5-8-rgb_front fireball is a sorcery but you may pay the x damage and have it deal to a single creature or play
fux-zuwyx2q_6-8-rgb_front however fireball has the extra added thing that you may deal damage to multiple targets
fux-zuwyx2q_7-8-rgb_front so you would divide that damage evenly among the targets but you also have to pay one additional colorless mana for each additional target
fux-zuwyx2q_8-8-rgb_front so if you were targeting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red and then you would start counting mana for the x
fux-zuwyx2q_9-8-rgb_front likewise with two three and so forth
fyi1ev5m1w4_0_1-8-rgb_front ok now let is talk about turning the compost pile well if it is all good and you put this pile together right you do not have to turn the compost pile
fyi1ev5m1w4_10-8-rgb_front but we have plenty in the woods
fyi1ev5m1w4_11-8-rgb_front you would add your garden debris for aeration
fyi1ev5m1w4_12-8-rgb_front and then you would start to turn your pile
fyi1ev5m1w4_13-8-rgb_front you would take the top and you would put it on the bottom just like this
fyi1ev5m1w4_2-8-rgb_front because if you layered it right and you watered it right and you got your microorganisms in there and you put the compost inoculate in there you should not have to turn this pile
fyi1ev5m1w4_3-8-rgb_front now obviously this is a brand new pile that we just made today
fyi1ev5m1w4_4-8-rgb_front but if for some reason your pile did not cook down which means if your pile is four feet high when it is finished it should be about a foot and a half high
fyi1ev5m1w4_5-8-rgb_front and it should cook down and it should go down and you should be able to see that it looks like compost not like this material
fyi1ev5m1w4_6-8-rgb_front but if you come across your pile and it has not done those things then you are going to want to turn your pile
fyi1ev5m1w4_7-8-rgb_front the way we would do that is we would do just like we did in the beginning
fyi1ev5m1w4_8-8-rgb_front we would put holes in the ground so it would drain good
fyi1ev5m1w4_9-8-rgb_front we would some more sticks which we have run out of
