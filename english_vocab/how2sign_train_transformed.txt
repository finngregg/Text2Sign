--7e2su6zp4_10-5-rgb_front and i call them decorative elements because basically all they are meant to do is to enrich and color the page
--7e2su6zp4_11-5-rgb_front so they do not really have much of a symbolic meaning other than maybe life is richer life is beautiful but they have become so beautifully stylized and so you find them in different illuminative being rendered in very different ways
--7e2su6zp4_12-5-rgb_front now this is very this is actually an insert of a kind of an envelope for stationary and this is a very italian design
--7e2su6zp4_13-5-rgb_front this is all the you know take off on the idea of the acanthus leaf
--7e2su6zp4_5-5-rgb_front it is almost has a feathery like posture to it
--7e2su6zp4_6-5-rgb_front and so it is used in architecture as a decorative element in architecture on columns and so on and it is also used a great deal in illumination
--7e2su6zp4_7-5-rgb_front and so what is happened with the idea of acanthus leaf is that it has is taken on all these different creative looks
--7e2su6zp4_8-5-rgb_front and it has been wildly colored so you can look at some an acanthus leaf and you can start with the idea of a black and white drawing
--7e2su6zp4_9-5-rgb_front here actually i have some samples of traced acanthus leaves from different illuminated manuscripts
--8psdec-fg_0-5-rgb_front hi
--8psdec-fg_1-5-rgb_front my name is dr art bowler
--8psdec-fg_10-5-rgb_front are you always focused on the positive aspects of your physical self instead of the negative
--8psdec-fg_11-5-rgb_front if so you have high self esteem
--8psdec-fg_12-5-rgb_front low self esteem tends to bring us down and there is a set of thoughts or cognitions that tend to go with low self esteem
--8psdec-fg_13-5-rgb_front such as i am unlove unlovable and no one will like me
--8psdec-fg_14-5-rgb_front by doing cognitive therapy and working on those thoughts we can help our clients to feel better about themselves by gaining a more accurate appraisal of themselves their situation and their environment
--8psdec-fg_15-5-rgb_front it is really important to notice if you have low self esteem because then you can do something about it
--8psdec-fg_16-5-rgb_front this is dr art bowler and this has been how to tell if you have low self esteem
--8psdec-fg_2-5-rgb_front and i am a psychologist in manhattan new york city where i have my own private practice
--8psdec-fg_3-5-rgb_front in this clip i am going to talk about how to tell if you have low self esteem
--8psdec-fg_4-5-rgb_front low self esteem or a low feeling about oneself is unfortunately very common
--8psdec-fg_5-5-rgb_front but fortunately it is very fixable
--8psdec-fg_6-5-rgb_front when one has low self esteem the way you can tell is look in the mirror
--8psdec-fg_7-5-rgb_front how do you feel about yourself
--8psdec-fg_8-5-rgb_front what do you see
--8psdec-fg_9-5-rgb_front do you see the positive parts of your personality or do you notice the negative
--danj_01au_0-5-rgb_front in the side position we are going to be palming and thumbing the sen lines on the legs
--danj_01au_1-5-rgb_front now make sure your client is comfortable in the side position supporting your head knee supported arms are resting in front comfortably
--danj_01au_10-5-rgb_front i lift it up enough to make sure that i am comfortable
--danj_01au_11-5-rgb_front come back and forth
--danj_01au_12-5-rgb_front always make sure you get a little thumbing in there too
--danj_01au_13-5-rgb_front so we are going to start again on this one
--danj_01au_14-5-rgb_front place the thumb place the thumb just on the side of leg and just kind of you will feel that you will feel a little groove in there so you are not pressing up on any bones
--danj_01au_15-5-rgb_front and just thumb up and pressing in the thumb in the area where my fingerprint would be not on the tips of that stabbing her with my fingernails
--danj_01au_16-5-rgb_front be very mindful of that
--danj_01au_17-5-rgb_front coming in here and again nice rocking back and forth back and forth
--danj_01au_18-5-rgb_front not applying too much thumb pressure to not only save your own thumbs but to not kind of over press on your client
--danj_01au_19-5-rgb_front back and forth
--danj_01au_2-5-rgb_front so starting with palming on sen lines with this leg
--danj_01au_20-5-rgb_front back and forth
--danj_01au_21-5-rgb_front always giving a little bit of meta a little loving kindness as you finish
--danj_01au_3-5-rgb_front on the front leg you are going to be doing the outside
--danj_01au_4-5-rgb_front and on the inside leg closest to you you are going to be doing the inside
--danj_01au_5-5-rgb_front so we are going to start with the inside leg first
--danj_01au_6-5-rgb_front placing the palm placing the palm and then start in a nice rocking fashion
--danj_01au_7-5-rgb_front walking it up rocking it down
--danj_01au_8-5-rgb_front and you can do this as long or as short as the massage requires time wise or your client is needs
--danj_01au_9-5-rgb_front coming to the other one and again just in a nice rocking position
-00cp1igidw_1-5-rgb_front if you like to find more about my services you can visit my website canineheadstart com
-00cp1igidw_10_11-5-rgb_front so that is one option another option is if you know your dog has fleas there is something called cap star and this is a product that is oral product
-00cp1igidw_12-5-rgb_front it works right away and it will actually kill all of the fleas that are on the dog for the next hours and it start working in about minutes
-00cp1igidw_13-5-rgb_front so if you taken your dog to a place or a friends house or to a training school and you believe that there are fleas there and your dog may have gotten fleas this is a great product to use when you are about to leave before you bring your dog to your home
-00cp1igidw_14-5-rgb_front again this is a oral preventive and this is also a oral preventive
-00cp1igidw_15-5-rgb_front we are going to be talking about external flea prevention in the next video
-00cp1igidw_2-5-rgb_front so we are going to be talking about flea prevention in this short video clip
-00cp1igidw_3-5-rgb_front there are a number of products out there that you can use on your dog obviously one way to prevent fleas is not have you dog go out side but that is not really realistic
-00cp1igidw_4-5-rgb_front so we are going to be talking about products that you can use to prevent fleas
-00cp1igidw_5-5-rgb_front in the last of couple of years there has been a increase of different types of options out there that you can use
-00cp1igidw_6-5-rgb_front i am just going to talk about three of the ones that are most commonly used and seems to be more effective
-00cp1igidw_7-5-rgb_front so there is something called sentinel and this is a monthly tablet and sentinel actually prevents not only fleas but heart worm as well and the come individually wrap packages
-00cp1igidw_8-5-rgb_front the dogs typically like to eat them they are flavored so they chew them right up and what this does is it prevents the production of cottin so if a flea jumps on your dog bites your dog and ingest the blood meal then the blood meal would have the chemical ingredients of the sentinel when they lay there eggs they would not be able to produce cottin
-00cp1igidw_9-5-rgb_front cottion is the excess scalp of a flea so it does not kill the fleas but it prevents them from infesting or reproducing in your home
-06_njnhorg_0-5-rgb_front some of the days that are the hardest are when you know i start out first thing in the morning and things just like i woke up on the wrong side of the bed or or whatever you know type of phrase you want to use
-06_njnhorg_1-5-rgb_front but things just do not go right from the very beginning
-06_njnhorg_10-5-rgb_front i have lots of clients that want cleaning done thursdays and fridays because they want it done right before the weekend
-06_njnhorg_11-5-rgb_front so thursdays are really
-06_njnhorg_12-5-rgb_front i have got three very big jobs three very big houses that have you know three and four bathrooms and just large houses so that makes for a really long day
-06_njnhorg_13-5-rgb_front and i had one of those days where i just woke up and things just did not want to go my way
-06_njnhorg_14-5-rgb_front so i i continued to fight through it fight through it did not feel real great
-06_njnhorg_15-5-rgb_front so got in the car got to the first job everything went you know okay i was good but i was still a little bit late
-06_njnhorg_16-5-rgb_front so got to the next job and you know moving right along and i go out to get some cleaning supplies out of my car and it is locked
-06_njnhorg_17-5-rgb_front and i go to get my keys out of my little supply box and they were not in there so i you know look around for my keys and sure enough they are locked in my car and i have no extras
-06_njnhorg_18-5-rgb_front i have none at home i have no extras cause i have an extra key in my car and i have my remote in my car
-06_njnhorg_19-5-rgb_front and so that was kind of tough
-06_njnhorg_2-5-rgb_front you get a late start you you know get to the house and it is an extra big mess and you know you just one thing after the other just leads to a tough day of of a long tough day working
-06_njnhorg_20-5-rgb_front so i you know i had to just fight through the cleaning and had to have a come out and open my doors and i had to go to another job
-06_njnhorg_21-5-rgb_front so you know sometimes when things just do not go your way you know you just have a rough day and you go to bed that night and you hopefully wake up the next morning and and it is all better
-06_njnhorg_3-5-rgb_front generally i i will schedule two to three houses a day and if i get a late start then you know of course that just delays the next job and then the next job and then it can be seven or eight at night when i get home
-06_njnhorg_4_5-5-rgb_front and one thing that i like i try not to do is to interfere with my client is family time as well so when i get a late start and maybe i have a horrendous house that i had to clean and and was not planning on it then my day gets later and i start to intrude into their family time
-06_njnhorg_6_7-5-rgb_front and and that makes it tough for me i do not i do not like to do that at all so that is probably the hardest part is if i do not start my day right
-06_njnhorg_8-5-rgb_front so i kind of have to mentally prepare myself for my day so that is probably the hardest day for me is not preparing myself
-06_njnhorg_9-5-rgb_front one of my toughest days are thursdays
-08zgcvicm4_0-5-rgb_front hello welcome my name is julio nutt and i am a master instructor of the jim mclean golf school in miami florida
-08zgcvicm4_1-5-rgb_front in this clip i am going to talk about a great drill that is really going to help you to shift your weight forward
-08zgcvicm4_2-5-rgb_front in golf you have got to learn to shift your weight forward in order to hit the ball and transfer your weight into your left side
-08zgcvicm4_3-5-rgb_front but many amateurs when hitting the ball they hang to the right side they get their arms really close and tight to their bodies and they have a lot of difficulty transferring their weight into their left side
-08zgcvicm4_4-5-rgb_front just using a shaft would be a great drill to use because when we are throwing something forward we are throwing a frisbee if we are throwing a ball the natural motion is to throw the weight with it
-08zgcvicm4_5-5-rgb_front so right now i am not going to think about hitting the golf ball i am going to think about throwing the shaft
-08zgcvicm4_6-5-rgb_front so i am going to get in my golf position and as i swing i am going to let the shot go as hard as i can and that is really going to help me develop the habit of throwing my weight
-08zgcvicm4_7-5-rgb_front that is a great tip that i give to a lot of my students
-08zgcvicm4_8-5-rgb_front when hitting the ball think about throwing the club and that is going to generate extension and weight transfer
-08zgcvicm4_9-5-rgb_front this is julio nutt at the jim mclean golf school
-0bynf9tsni_1-5-rgb_front today i am going to take you back into time and i am going to show you one of my grandmother is favorite things to make the kids and that was sweet bruschetta
-0bynf9tsni_10-5-rgb_front this recipe what my grandmother use to do this and i hope you enjoy it i hope you make it it is really fun and fast
-0bynf9tsni_11-5-rgb_front the kids will love you for it
-0bynf9tsni_12-5-rgb_front i will show you the ingredients utensils it is literally minutes and it is done
-0bynf9tsni_13-5-rgb_front i hope you make it
-0bynf9tsni_2-5-rgb_front sweet bruschetta is just the mixing of different things chopped up and baked in the oven
-0bynf9tsni_4-5-rgb_front but today we are going to show you one for the kids and especially the big kids like me
-0bynf9tsni_5-5-rgb_front i mean this is nice
-0bynf9tsni_6-5-rgb_front you are going to use a whole bunch of things like bananas is the main thing
-0bynf9tsni_7-5-rgb_front when you put in beneath that flame it glazes and just comes out spectacular
-0bynf9tsni_8-5-rgb_front i am going to show you all the ingredients of this recipe
-0bynf9tsni_9-5-rgb_front this is at least years old i think
-0fa6ohxzse_0-5-rgb_front david clemen hi
-0fa6ohxzse_10-5-rgb_front i am but i played sports with right so i do squeegee with the right hand
-0fa6ohxzse_11-5-rgb_front and so that is squeegeeing the second color
-0fa6ohxzse_2-5-rgb_front alright now that i have plopped my white paint i am going to pick up my favorite tool again
-0fa6ohxzse_3-5-rgb_front and i am just going to come in here and just kinda fill it out
-0fa6ohxzse_4-5-rgb_front and now when you mix the red and white in big areas if it is too much red and you do not move it fast enough you will start to get pink so i want to try and keep the integrity of the white and i am just going to move that fast and see do not know if you can see it but since the paint has kind of dried quickly on this paint on the wood it is already created a texture underneath of it
-0fa6ohxzse_5-5-rgb_front so now i am getting this texture of the paint underneath of it
-0fa6ohxzse_6-5-rgb_front so i am just going to come in here and do these big squeegee marks and not going to go too crazy with it
-0fa6ohxzse_7-5-rgb_front and i am not trying to cover up all the red
-0fa6ohxzse_8-5-rgb_front i am just trying to get certain areas and show the white on the top of the red
-0fa6ohxzse_9-5-rgb_front and then i can come in and i can actually just do almost like i guess you would say it is like almost a karate chop or samurai swing to the right or left
-0jdyltf9y8_0_1-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about how to buy a trophy most people will come into my show room and they will ask me how much is a twenty inch trophy
-0jdyltf9y8_10-5-rgb_front so when it comes to buying a trophy it is not how tall it is for the dollar
-0jdyltf9y8_11-5-rgb_front it is really what you get for your dollar
-0jdyltf9y8_2-5-rgb_front and i say to them we do not sell trophies by the inch and i give them this fine example here
-0jdyltf9y8_3-5-rgb_front this is a inch trophy
-0jdyltf9y8_4-5-rgb_front if you go to any trophy store and they can offer you this inch trophy for as little as
-0jdyltf9y8_5-5-rgb_front as you can see if you were to buy a trophy by the inch someone could sell you this and you would not be very happy with it
-0jdyltf9y8_6-5-rgb_front so my recommendation is not to try and buy a trophy based on how tall it is but take into consideration the materials that it is made of
-0jdyltf9y8_7-5-rgb_front we use marble bases that are imported directly from italy
-0jdyltf9y8_8-5-rgb_front we also put little felt dots on the bottom of the trophies and that keeps them from scratching your furniture when you get home
-0jdyltf9y8_9-5-rgb_front a lot of times people will try and save money in building a trophy by leaving out these little things
-0n0jbybw6g_0-5-rgb_front hello
-0n0jbybw6g_1-5-rgb_front we are going to be speaking about cross stitch craft kits today
-0n0jbybw6g_10-5-rgb_front my name is daniel king
-0n0jbybw6g_11-5-rgb_front thank you
-0n0jbybw6g_2-5-rgb_front my name is daniel king and i am an experienced pattern maker designer and sewer
-0n0jbybw6g_3-5-rgb_front cross stitch craft kits are kits that you can order through many craft stores or art supply stores
-0n0jbybw6g_4-5-rgb_front these kits allow you to do different designs
-0n0jbybw6g_5-5-rgb_front what the kit incorporates is a fabric background usually the different colored threads and a hoop for hooping and taut to make the fabric taut
-0n0jbybw6g_6-5-rgb_front with these designs you can make typically any type of plaque maybe stockings for christmas or even portraits
-0n0jbybw6g_7-5-rgb_front it allows you to take these different threads and stitch one through the fabric and to follow along the design to create whatever design it is
-0n0jbybw6g_8-5-rgb_front these kits are available in most craft stores and it gives you some flexibility as to what kind of designs you like
-0n0jbybw6g_9-5-rgb_front again we are talking about cross stitch cross stitch craft kits
-0zqnvfv7ei_0-5-rgb_front this is robert stewart with com
-0zqnvfv7ei_1-5-rgb_front now we are going to talk about some advanced tactics and the importance of employing all that you have learned in terms of individual drilling and all of the basic tactical awarenesses and skills you need to have to function as a highly effective player
-0zqnvfv7ei_2-5-rgb_front when you get into advance tactics you are talking about a lot of teamwork
-0zqnvfv7ei_3-5-rgb_front you are talking about everyone on your team having those individual skills down and being able to use them in concert with one another so we are going to be going over the taking of buildings the defending of buildings and the critical elements required tactically to integrate a team together and have them function as a single system with a goal where everyone on the team is working together
-0zqnvfv7ei_4-5-rgb_front a lot of what is required is stressing the importance of communication
-0zqnvfv7ei_5-5-rgb_front it is stressing the importance of maintaining your situational awareness
-0zqnvfv7ei_6-5-rgb_front knowing what is happening with your other team members at all times and inside of the shifting dynamics having the tactical skills necessary to support defend and be aggressive at the same time
-0dac3swcpq_0-5-rgb_front hello
-0dac3swcpq_1-5-rgb_front we are terry and laura neven
-0dac3swcpq_10-5-rgb_front when you teach your children at home it allows you a greater opportunity to have time as a family
-0dac3swcpq_11-5-rgb_front one important reason for the benefit of home schooling is academic success
-0dac3swcpq_12-5-rgb_front researh says that the average home school child is to grades levels above their public or private school peers
-0dac3swcpq_13-5-rgb_front these are just some of the wonderful benefits why families home school
-0dac3swcpq_2-5-rgb_front i am the administrator of california educators and principal of sunland christian school
-0dac3swcpq_3-5-rgb_front this clip we will talk about the benefits to home schooling
-0dac3swcpq_4-5-rgb_front many families begin to home school not because of concerns of academics or because of concerns of the local public or private school because they are concerned about things relative to the family
-0dac3swcpq_5-5-rgb_front home schooling can provide a great opportunity for family unity
-0dac3swcpq_6-5-rgb_front to do things together to learn together and to grow together
-0dac3swcpq_7-5-rgb_front in specifically southern california there is a lot of issues relative to a flexibility of schedule
-0dac3swcpq_8-5-rgb_front it is important to understand that home schooling allows for great flexibility
-0dac3swcpq_9-5-rgb_front moms are already running around like chickens with their heads cut off taxing kids here and there
-0op2h0vagy_1-5-rgb_front this is a great who dun it guessing game and you should use a minimum of people
-0op2h0vagy_10-5-rgb_front when the murderer chooses they will choose a victim and kill them
-0op2h0vagy_11-5-rgb_front how they will do that is by shaking their hand and doing a little tickle inside
-0op2h0vagy_12-5-rgb_front so just scratching the inside of the hand but doing it very discreetly so that no one else sees when the victim has been killed
-0op2h0vagy_13-5-rgb_front they have to shake three more hands just so that it is not obvious who killed them and then they get to choose a way they want to die nice and big and dramatic
-0op2h0vagy_14-5-rgb_front so if i was to kill david hi how are you he is going to shake three more hands and on the third hand die
-0op2h0vagy_15-5-rgb_front aahh good then we have our victim dead lying on the floor and the rest of us have to try to figure out who killed him
-0op2h0vagy_16-5-rgb_front now again only the person running the game and the person that is dead knows but the person that is dead can not say anything
-0op2h0vagy_17-5-rgb_front so you vote and the majority wins so whoever you want to its kind of a witch hunt at this point you just pick and choose who you think might look suspicious and if that person actually is indeed the murderer lets say you say ah everyone agrees it was joe the person running the game knows if its joe or not if it was joe they say yes you guys have won if its not they just say nope that is not the murderer and you just joe has to die though and then the games goes again and again until either the murderer is killed every body off without being killed themselves or until they have been found out by the crowd
-0op2h0vagy_18-5-rgb_front and that is how you play murderer
-0op2h0vagy_2-5-rgb_front the more the merrier
-0op2h0vagy_3-5-rgb_front what you do one is choose one person who is just going to run the game
-0op2h0vagy_4-5-rgb_front they do not actually get to participate so if you are playing this with kids maybe if you have an adult in the room they could choose to be the one running the game or just maybe an adult that does not feel like playing if its a group of adults they can run the game
-0op2h0vagy_5-5-rgb_front basically they are going to have all the adults close their eyes or kids close or cover your eyes and the person running the game will choose one person to be the murderer
-0op2h0vagy_6-5-rgb_front they just choose them by tapping them gently on the head
-0op2h0vagy_7-5-rgb_front that person is the murderer only they know it and the person running the game knows it
-0op2h0vagy_8-5-rgb_front everybody is eyes open and the game begins
-0op2h0vagy_9-5-rgb_front you just start walking around the room shaking everybody is hands with a nice greeting hi how are you hi how are you
-0sphqzt1eq_1-5-rgb_front today i am going to teach you how to become a competitive baseball player
-0sphqzt1eq_2-5-rgb_front in this segment we are going to demonstrate batting practice with live pitching
-0sphqzt1eq_3-5-rgb_front now as oppose of the machine the machine pitches automatic fastballs and an automatic curve balls going from one angle to one angle only
-0sphqzt1eq_4-5-rgb_front life pitching determines more of a simulated angle of the game as the pitchers as hitters are seeing pitchers from various arm angles to where they can adjust to improve there hitting
-0sphqzt1eq_5-5-rgb_front this makes to be a more effective hitting practice regiment than the machine
-0sphqzt1eq_6-5-rgb_front the machine is mainly for timing for fastballs
-0sphqzt1eq_7-5-rgb_front but as opposed to the live pitching you get various angles live angles from an actual pitcher when hitting the ball
-0sphqzt1eq_8-5-rgb_front normally for a lefty you would set this type of a l cage at this and have balls being thrown by a left handed pitcher on this end
-0sphqzt1eq_9-5-rgb_front you can flip the machine over flip the cage over in order to throw the ball right handed
-0yraqy7nte_0-5-rgb_front hi

-1pevdiwiq0_11-8-rgb_front so find out whether you are really a new car buyer or maybe you are a used car buyer with the same model year with a few miles on it so that you can save yourself some money
-1pevdiwiq0_12-8-rgb_front you can save upwards of to and even sometimes thousand dollars on buying a new used car versus buying a brand new car without an mos
-1pevdiwiq0_13-8-rgb_front so find out whether or not you are really a new car buyer
-1pevdiwiq0_14-8-rgb_front when it comes to buying a new car remember its ok to say no
-1pevdiwiq0_15-8-rgb_front just cause they ask you to pay a certain amount of money for a car does not mean that you have to
-1pevdiwiq0_16-8-rgb_front sometimes the best tactic to buying a new car is getting up and leaving
-1pevdiwiq0_17-8-rgb_front if they say they can not sell you the car and they really can not then they will not but there is no reason why you can not come back tomorrow and try again but if they come chasing you out the door and they say ok ok we want to sell you the car then you can feel like you got a good deal
-1pevdiwiq0_18-8-rgb_front when buying a new car do not be afraid to ask your dealership to allow them to allow you to look at the invoice
-1pevdiwiq0_19-8-rgb_front that is what they paid for the car and nine times out of ten the dealership will be willing to share that information with you in order for you to make an educated decision
-1pevdiwiq0_2-8-rgb_front in this segment we are talk about negotiating on a new car
-1pevdiwiq0_20-8-rgb_front if you know how much they paid for a car then you are willing to offer them a little bit more than what they paid for the car usually they will be willing to sell it to
-1pevdiwiq0_21-8-rgb_front also remember that when buying a new car depending on how many days its been in their inventory they may be motivated to sell that particular car than not
-1pevdiwiq0_22-8-rgb_front so do not be afraid to ask if you can purchase the car that is many days in stock so that they will be willing to give you a better car deal
-1pevdiwiq0_23-8-rgb_front remember just because buying a car at invoice is what the dealership does does not mean you have to
-1pevdiwiq0_24-8-rgb_front you can always buy the car for below invoice especially if that dealership is had that car in stock for more than days
-1pevdiwiq0_25-8-rgb_front remember do not be afraid to ask
-1pevdiwiq0_26-8-rgb_front negotiating is why you are there
-1pevdiwiq0_3-8-rgb_front its easy to buy a new car cause they will either tell you yes you can buy it for that or no you can not
-1pevdiwiq0_4-8-rgb_front the manufacturers is the one that determines what the car costs
-1pevdiwiq0_5-8-rgb_front the dealership buys the car from the manufacturer and there are many websites out there that tell you what the actual cost of the car is
-1pevdiwiq0_6-8-rgb_front once you determine how much that car costs its up to the dealership whether to sell you the car for that for less than that or for more than that
-1pevdiwiq0_7-8-rgb_front depending on the desirability of that new car which means how hot it is in the market that is exactly what is going to determine whether you get a great deal on your new car purchase or not necessarily a great deal
-1pevdiwiq0_8-8-rgb_front always remember that the difference between a new car and a used car is that a new car has an mso which is the manufacture certificate of origin
-1pevdiwiq0_9-8-rgb_front the minute that you purchase that new car though it becomes titled and then it becomes a used car
-1uik-vwqoc_0-5-rgb_front i am cooie and in this clip i will show you how to use unique headstones to customize your yard
-1uik-vwqoc_1-5-rgb_front another way to add interest to your yard in our family we make little headstones for all our dogs that have died
-1uik-vwqoc_2-5-rgb_front this particular one is our golden retriever
-1uik-vwqoc_3-5-rgb_front scooter so that is his name in old typeset
-1uik-vwqoc_4-5-rgb_front these are the colors that were in his collar
-1uik-vwqoc_5-5-rgb_front he was a golden retriever so we have that and he also loved to chase raccoons and he had chased one a short time before he died so we put a raccoon in it
-1uik-vwqoc_6-5-rgb_front that you can place around the yard it is a simple mosaic stepping stone technique but we just added some different pieces to make it more interesting
-1uik-vwqoc_7-5-rgb_front you can add memorial plaques or plaques for members of your family that are do not live there and you miss them to sort of remembrances
-1uik-vwqoc_8-5-rgb_front they add a nice personal touch to your yard
-1uik-vwqoc_9-5-rgb_front adding a mosaic headstone to your yard can make more personal and unique
-1xunputrgk_0-5-rgb_front okay another thing that for me is important
-1xunputrgk_1-5-rgb_front it may not be for you
-1xunputrgk_10-5-rgb_front feel free to get the
-1xunputrgk_11-5-rgb_front you have little masks they are just paper masks
-1xunputrgk_12-5-rgb_front you can get them at home depot or lowes
-1xunputrgk_13-5-rgb_front and they are actually called painters masks
-1xunputrgk_14-5-rgb_front some of them are just made of paper
-1xunputrgk_15-5-rgb_front but they are very affordable
-1xunputrgk_16-5-rgb_front you can get a pack of you know several for just a couple of dollars
-1xunputrgk_17-5-rgb_front so make sure you
-1xunputrgk_18-5-rgb_front if you have those keep them in here on hand
-1xunputrgk_19-5-rgb_front you know it protects your health when you are cleaning
-1xunputrgk_2-5-rgb_front but for me i use very strong chemicals
-1xunputrgk_20-5-rgb_front you do not have to worry about any hazardous chemical getting into your system
-1xunputrgk_21-5-rgb_front and it just makes the whole process a lot safer for you
-1xunputrgk_22-5-rgb_front and for your children if you have children that help out cleaning around the house
-1xunputrgk_23-5-rgb_front so i would recommend having a mask on hand
-1xunputrgk_3-5-rgb_front some people may prefer to use products that do not have chemicals
-1xunputrgk_4-5-rgb_front but because i do i enjoy having the disinfectants
-1xunputrgk_5-5-rgb_front i like to wear a mask while i am cleaning
-1xunputrgk_6-5-rgb_front because you do not need to be breathing those chemicals in
-1xunputrgk_7-5-rgb_front especially you know when i am pregnant
-1xunputrgk_8-5-rgb_front a lot of women a lot of you out there
-1xunputrgk_9-5-rgb_front and men too that clean bathrooms
-1eulcddovq_0-5-rgb_front and with that we have our completed awards show menu and just in time because it looks like the is just ending
-1eulcddovq_1-5-rgb_front so let is go over what we have got here
-1eulcddovq_10-5-rgb_front if it is in place of a meal however you want to on five to seven different appetizers and again two to three per person
-1eulcddovq_2-5-rgb_front we started with our phyllo tartlets with the ricotta and sundried tomato and feta and goat cheese really delicious
-1eulcddovq_3-5-rgb_front then we did our puff pastry cheese straws which you see how it sort of draws your eye up
-1eulcddovq_4-5-rgb_front you have got very short small bites of the little smoked salmon canapes which is a nice contrast in height to the puff pastry cheese straws arranged in this vase just with some decorative rocks in the bottom
-1eulcddovq_5-5-rgb_front and then of course we go to the smoked salmon canape with some creme fraiche which is very creamy and then the saltiness of the fish and the nice nutty flavor and texture of european bread you can then take a little lemon juice to
-1eulcddovq_6-5-rgb_front and then we finish with our fricos our parmesan crackers with mache that baby lettuce and served in an alternate way in the martini glass with just the same parmesan crisp but not in the arced format
-1eulcddovq_7-5-rgb_front so just another guideline to keep in mind how do you know how many appetizers to make for your party
-1eulcddovq_8-5-rgb_front if it is not during a mealtime you want to have at least two to three kinds of appetizers so in this case we have got the four
-1eulcddovq_9-5-rgb_front but at least two to three kinds and bank on two minimum per person for your party
-1fufbij2s0_0-5-rgb_front laura banford now i am going to talk about knife sharpening
-1fufbij2s0_1-5-rgb_front an interesting part about a sharp knife or a knife that is not so sharp is it is much easier to cut yourself with a dull knife than it is with a sharp knife
-1fufbij2s0_10-5-rgb_front i happen to have this sharpening stone little system here that has three three stones on it
-1fufbij2s0_11-5-rgb_front this is a coarse stone for major sharpening tasks
-1fufbij2s0_12-5-rgb_front this is a medium stone which will give you a more refined sharpening task
-1fufbij2s0_13-5-rgb_front and this is a fine sharpening stone just to touch up your blade a little bit
-1fufbij2s0_14-5-rgb_front i sharpen my knives just about every day
-1fufbij2s0_15-5-rgb_front and i sharpen knives when i am at work i sharpen my knives before every task so i do not have to stop in the middle and go back and sharpen it
-1fufbij2s0_16_17_18-5-rgb_front this is a sharpening steel this does not sharpen your knife this will refine your blade but it will not sharpen your knife
-1fufbij2s0_19_20_21_22-5-rgb_front after you sharpen your knife you use this and i will show you that at the end okay what i want to do here is to get to get a nice edge on my knife
-1fufbij2s0_2-5-rgb_front now if you are working with a dull knife it is not cutting it is not cutting you are going to use a lot more pressure a lot more force and not get away from the actual technique that you should be using for whatever task you are doing and that is when you end up cutting yourself
-1fufbij2s0_23_24-5-rgb_front you want to hit take your knife and hit the sharpening stone at a degree angle that is about like this
-1fufbij2s0_25-5-rgb_front and you have to you will have to try it to get it right but you have to perfect your technique cause you want to go from the base of the knife near the guard all the way to the tip
-1fufbij2s0_26_27_28-5-rgb_front like that whatever you do one way you have to do the other way because you are making an edge and try to make sure you have the degree angle
-1fufbij2s0_29-5-rgb_front you would do that for a little while
-1fufbij2s0_3-5-rgb_front that is when accidents happen
-1fufbij2s0_30-5-rgb_front you might you might go from coarse to fine just to refine your edge
-1fufbij2s0_31-5-rgb_front and after that you want to use your sharpening steel which is really just refining the edge
-1fufbij2s0_32-5-rgb_front you see chefs do this
-1fufbij2s0_33-5-rgb_front that is just refining the edge
-1fufbij2s0_34-5-rgb_front the same as with the sharpening stone whatever you do to one side you have to do to the other side that is why you go like this
-1fufbij2s0_35-5-rgb_front and as in anything practice makes perfect
-1fufbij2s0_36-5-rgb_front when we come back we are going to use some of our knives
-1fufbij2s0_37-5-rgb_front see you then
-1fufbij2s0_4-5-rgb_front if you are pushing and using more force and straying away from the actual perfect technique you are going to cut yourself and i have done that
-1fufbij2s0_5-5-rgb_front i do not want to tell you about the frozen turkey thanksgiving morning
-1fufbij2s0_6-5-rgb_front that is an was a long time ago and i still remember it
-1fufbij2s0_7-5-rgb_front believe me
-1fufbij2s0_8-5-rgb_front the way to sharpen a knife is to use a sharpening stone
-1fufbij2s0_9-5-rgb_front a lot of chefs would buy a couple of sharpening stones in various degrees of coarseness
-1rm0t5fmie_0-5-rgb_front we are doing the scissoring now
-1rm0t5fmie_1-5-rgb_front there are two types of scissors that i like to use
-1rm0t5fmie_2-5-rgb_front the straight pair of scissors that are straight and long and then curved pair of scissors that help with around the feet and areas like that
-1rm0t5fmie_3-5-rgb_front first i am going to straighten up her leg to where i position the leg where i want it and then i am going to go down the backside of the leg
-1rm0t5fmie_4-5-rgb_front and if your dog tends to move you might want to hold your dog this way and just and you go around the leg and take off the little pieces that are sticking out everywhere
-1rm0t5fmie_5-5-rgb_front it makes for a nice little leg here
-1rm0t5fmie_6-5-rgb_front and then we are going to go around to the front area of the leg and i am going to go take the round scissors and round off the bottom and clean it up nice
-1rm0t5fmie_7-5-rgb_front remove the hair and pull her leg up and keep finishing with the little pieces of hair that are sticking out here and there
-1rm0t5fmie_8-5-rgb_front it makes for a nice scissor leg
-23pztqtdbw_0-5-rgb_front training for football
-23pztqtdbw_1-5-rgb_front isolated plank dog pointers
-23pztqtdbw_10-5-rgb_front so we are going to work one side of the body and then we will work the other side of your body and we want to follow a rep scheme of anywhere from ten reps to fifteen reps per side
-23pztqtdbw_11-5-rgb_front again that is ten reps to fifteen reps per side
-23pztqtdbw_12-5-rgb_front for the bigger guys it is going to be a bit harder i know but still try to stay with it
-23pztqtdbw_13-5-rgb_front it is really going to help with your stability and coordination and balance on the field
-23pztqtdbw_14-5-rgb_front and then after we finish with this exercise when we come back and start the workouts all over again with workout one you are going to have a lot more stability and balance to help develop more power
-23pztqtdbw_15-5-rgb_front so thanks a lot for joining us here i appreciate it
-23pztqtdbw_16-5-rgb_front i am mike rosengart and this is my workout partner jonsey
-23pztqtdbw_17-5-rgb_front check us out again online and have a good workout
-23pztqtdbw_2-5-rgb_front okay
-23pztqtdbw_3-5-rgb_front so this is the last exercise in our isolated series working from the dumbbell rows to the hops to the lateral hops forward hops and now we are going to do plank position and we are going to do dog pointers which is the same exercise that we did in our previous workout but this time we are going to do it isolated
-23pztqtdbw_4-5-rgb_front we are going to stick with one side we are going to add another variability into it
-23pztqtdbw_5-5-rgb_front so jonsey go ahead pop up into your plank position
-23pztqtdbw_6-5-rgb_front we are going to get the elbow and the knee to touch underneath your body each time and then get the full extension out
-23pztqtdbw_7-5-rgb_front so touch and full extension out
-23pztqtdbw_8-5-rgb_front alright
-23pztqtdbw_9-5-rgb_front this is really going to put focus on shoulder stability of the off shoulder and off hip at the same time working for balance and coordination and mobility through your torso as you are working
-3bw4dqeyf8_0-5-rgb_front you know a medical emergency in an infant can be a pretty scary and traumatic process for a parent or a rescuer
-3bw4dqeyf8_1-5-rgb_front hi i am captain joe bruni and what i am going to talk about is how to stop choking in the infant victim
-3bw4dqeyf8_2-5-rgb_front the infant victim must first be placed in the rescuer is arm supporting the head and chest area on the forearm
-3bw4dqeyf8_3-5-rgb_front find a place where you can sit with the victim placing them head down and supporting the head
-3bw4dqeyf8_4-5-rgb_front you will then deliver a series of five back blows and five chest thrusts in succession so it would be one two three four five
-3bw4dqeyf8_5-5-rgb_front roll the victim over supporting the head and body on the other forearm and deliver five chest thrusts in succession until the object has been dislodged
-3bw4dqeyf8_6-5-rgb_front after a series of five back blows and chest thrusts if it has not been dislodged then repeat the process of back blows and chest thrusts until the item is dislodged from the infant
-3bw4dqeyf8_7-5-rgb_front i am captain joe bruni
-3bw4dqeyf8_8-5-rgb_front stay safe and we will see you next time
-3sfcdbfxc8_0-5-rgb_front all right we are ready to start our fire
-3sfcdbfxc8_1-5-rgb_front what i always like to have nearby is my blower just in case it needs a little extra air and oxygen to get moving
-3sfcdbfxc8_10-5-rgb_front but you see you can insert these a lot further rather than having a hand held lighter and trying to get your hand in there
-3sfcdbfxc8_11-5-rgb_front or even using matches and throwing those
-3sfcdbfxc8_12-5-rgb_front and these tend to work better
-3sfcdbfxc8_13-5-rgb_front we will go ahead and see if its not too windy
-3sfcdbfxc8_14-5-rgb_front we have got a flame in there
-3sfcdbfxc8_15-5-rgb_front it looks like its catching
-3sfcdbfxc8_16-5-rgb_front can definitely see smoke and where there is smoke there is fire
-3sfcdbfxc8_17-5-rgb_front hopefully you can see the smoke on there and it looks like it is catching real well
-3sfcdbfxc8_18-5-rgb_front and make sure that you stand outside of the line of the smoke you would not want to be breathing in the smoke
-3sfcdbfxc8_19-5-rgb_front so here we have got the startings of our bon fire
-3sfcdbfxc8_2-5-rgb_front i do not think its going to be an issue today since we have got a nice little bit of wind coming at us
-3sfcdbfxc8_3-5-rgb_front and that speaks to the next point of wich area should you light first
-3sfcdbfxc8_4-5-rgb_front well you should light all around the fire two three four spots if you can
-3sfcdbfxc8_5-5-rgb_front but what we want to do is we want to light where the wind is coming from because that is going to give us a better chance of getting it catching fire catching all of it on fire
-3sfcdbfxc8_6-5-rgb_front maybe we will not have to light it in different spots around
-3sfcdbfxc8_7-5-rgb_front you will actually be able to tell once you actually get it in there and get it lit
-3sfcdbfxc8_8-5-rgb_front so i am going to go ahead and dip down here and hopefully you can see this
-3sfcdbfxc8_9-5-rgb_front and i am just going to light it and it might take a couple of times to get the lighter going
-4sl9mpolfa_0-3-rgb_front i like to put the glue bottle down sideways like this because it s a little bit quicker you do not have to let the glue run all the way down like when you put it upright
-4sl9mpolfa_1-3-rgb_front take a brush little glue brush just like this and spread this glue out very very thoroughly
-4sl9mpolfa_2-3-rgb_front make sure you get all the way to the end
-4sl9mpolfa_3-3-rgb_front cover everything
-4sl9mpolfa_4-3-rgb_front and you do not want a whole lot of sloppy glue running everywhere but you do want to have enough to completely coat all the parts
-4sl9mpolfa_5-3-rgb_front and then we will brush it out a little bit
-4sl9mpolfa_6-3-rgb_front that looks pretty good
-4sl9mpolfa_7-3-rgb_front set that down and we are going to do the same thing to this side
-6pulg1jlpc_0-5-rgb_front o k perfect we are going to get started in a second
-6pulg1jlpc_1-5-rgb_front i know a lot of ladies out there are wondering how do i get my skin clean

-6pulg1jlpc_11-5-rgb_front so make sure to use a good cleansing product when removing makeup
-6pulg1jlpc_12-5-rgb_front makeup is something that all women love to use but we also need to remember to remove it properly
-6pulg1jlpc_13-5-rgb_front simply apply the cleanser or cream to your hands and apply it to the face and begin rubbing

-6pzkp-zc78_0-5-rgb_front hi i am stan defreitas mr green thumb for on gardening
-6pzkp-zc78_1-5-rgb_front now this is a petunia variety called wave
-6pzkp-zc78_2-5-rgb_front and you can see the reason it is called wave because it tends to just lap over every area
-6pzkp-zc78_3-5-rgb_front now there is a bunch of different kinds of petunias which we have talked about in the past in different things but the wave petunia is one that you will find great for a hanging basket or as a bedding plant where you want it to spill over into another area
-6pzkp-zc78_4-5-rgb_front the wave petunias will flower just about every day and they will give you a bunch of flowers from early spring through fall depending on where you are at
-6pzkp-zc78_5-5-rgb_front now petunias are fairly heavy feeders so i would make sure that you give it about every week or two about half strength with a good water soluble plant food
-6pzkp-zc78_6-5-rgb_front you might also when you plant them make sure it is got good peat and pearl like combination
-6pzkp-zc78_7-5-rgb_front many of the good mixes that are professional mixes will be good for this particular plant
-6pzkp-zc78_8-5-rgb_front remember in baskets they tend to dry out a little bit quicker so if you have got a hanging basket like this one is you are going to have to make sure that you water it on almost a daily basis
-6pzkp-zc78_9-5-rgb_front for on gardening i am stan defreitas mr green thumb
-6yyqn8lplg_1-5-rgb_front running tumbling is going to be a great way for the whole entire squad to show off their tumbling skills
-6yyqn8lplg_10-5-rgb_front we are going to have a second group of tumblers facing diagonal on the right hand side
-6yyqn8lplg_11-5-rgb_front then you are going to designate which side is going to go first
-6yyqn8lplg_12-5-rgb_front they are going to do their running their back handspring all the way till you land
-6yyqn8lplg_13-5-rgb_front and then you need to continue stepping off your floor
-6yyqn8lplg_14-5-rgb_front now it is really important for these to go really fast for them to be effective
-6yyqn8lplg_15-5-rgb_front so as soon as you see the person cross in front of you you want to start with your run
-6yyqn8lplg_16-5-rgb_front and it is going to be really great because we are going to have a lot of building momentum
-6yyqn8lplg_17-5-rgb_front we are going to have someone go with the handspring someone go with the handspring tuck someone go with the handspring full someone go with the double layout full
-6yyqn8lplg_2-5-rgb_front now granted every squad is going to have tumblers of different levels
-6yyqn8lplg_3-5-rgb_front a lot of squads are going to have people who can just do the back handspring all the way up to people who can master double fulls
-6yyqn8lplg_4-5-rgb_front now when you are doing your running tumbling usually you want to make sure you can get as much distance as you can as much run and it is all going to start off with the back handspring
-6yyqn8lplg_5-5-rgb_front that is where we are going to get all of our momentum from
-6yyqn8lplg_6-5-rgb_front now if the back handspring is the highest skill you have mastered that is wonderful and you are going to go ahead and be the first person to go on your squad
-6yyqn8lplg_7-5-rgb_front usually what we try to do is build the tumbling from the lowest level all the way up to the highest level
-6yyqn8lplg_8-5-rgb_front now the most common tumbling pattern that we are going to use on cheerleading squads is what we like to call the x
-6yyqn8lplg_9-5-rgb_front we are going to have a group of tumblers in line facing diagonal on the left hand side
-6vhgmctyyi_0-5-rgb_front alright we have taken a look at what it is that you are good at
-6vhgmctyyi_1-5-rgb_front what skills you have and your educational background so it is time to take a look at your work experience
-6vhgmctyyi_10-5-rgb_front what did you get out of that
-6vhgmctyyi_11-5-rgb_front what did you learn from that job or from that work experience that will help you with you new employer will help you get a job
-6vhgmctyyi_12-5-rgb_front that is how you have to think about in terms of past work experience
-6vhgmctyyi_2-5-rgb_front what kind of jobs have you had before
-6vhgmctyyi_3-5-rgb_front maybe you have just had college type jobs that maybe were not necessarily career jobs
-6vhgmctyyi_4-5-rgb_front or maybe you have had some feel like of a better word real jobs
-6vhgmctyyi_5-5-rgb_front what you want to do is take a look at that work experience
-6vhgmctyyi_6-5-rgb_front what did you gain from it
-6vhgmctyyi_7-5-rgb_front did you you know gain problem solving skills
-6vhgmctyyi_8-5-rgb_front did you gain customer service skills
-6vhgmctyyi_9-5-rgb_front do not just think in terms of well i worked here
-6xqu_wilh4_5-5-rgb_front so that is how i am going to be packing my books and my cd is since i have them in these containers here i am probably going to keep them in these containers so that i do not have to use up another box and because they are pretty heavy just as they are right now in these things
-6xqu_wilh4_6-5-rgb_front and i am going to just put a piece of tape or a rubber band around it around this case vertically to keep my cd is from coming out of the box
-6xqu_wilh4_7-5-rgb_front and so those are some ideas on how to pack your books and your cd is
-70d86emmic_0-5-rgb_front yolanda vanveen hi

-70d86emmic_13-5-rgb_front ismene or peruvian daffodil is a plant we sell in the summertime that is from peru where the incas developed it so i like to think here we are years later or years later still enjoying a plant that their civilization created for us
-70d86emmic_14-5-rgb_front they are beautiful beautiful plants
-70d86emmic_15-5-rgb_front my favorite location for where plants grow especially bulbs is south africa
-70d86emmic_16-5-rgb_front there is a small area on the cape that produces of all the bulbs that ever grown in the whole world
-70d86emmic_17-5-rgb_front we enjoy freesia gladiolus calla lilies watsonias everything eucomis from south africa and we do not even realize an area the size of the portland metropolitan area produced all those plants
-70d86emmic_18-5-rgb_front next watch the second part on our discussion of the native areas for flower bulbs
-70d86emmic_2-5-rgb_front i wanted to talk about where in the world do flower bulbs come from
-70d86emmic_3-5-rgb_front i am always fascinated that there is really only a few regions in the world that all of the flower bulbs that you see in your garden actually originated from
-70d86emmic_4-5-rgb_front we are in north america right here and the bulbs that i sell were on the pacific west coast
-70d86emmic_5-5-rgb_front i am in kalama washington just north of portland oregon and i sell a few native bulbs that are from our area like the triteleias which are little purple blue flowers and camassia also called camas root
-70d86emmic_6-5-rgb_front camas washington was named after that plant and the natives used to eat the little corms just like you eat hazelnuts or beer nuts
-70d86emmic_7-5-rgb_front there are lots of other plants that come from america too liatris or is from the midwest and then we go down to mexico and i have canna lilies tigridias mexican feather grass pretty much any plant
-70d86emmic_8-5-rgb_front most bulbs are from mountainous regions
-70d86emmic_9-5-rgb_front so everywhere all the way from the cascades down through mexico you will find most bulbs
-7bty3iqido_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to trim the edge of the opening of the ballet slipper with some little pearls
-7bty3iqido_1-8-rgb_front and we are going to pipe the pearls with a number four tip
-7bty3iqido_10-8-rgb_front so you want to put pressure
-7bty3iqido_11-8-rgb_front release pressure and pull up
-7bty3iqido_12-8-rgb_front squeeze release and pull up
-7bty3iqido_13-8-rgb_front practice this on a piece of paper or a paper plate until you have a nice uniform pearl trim
-7bty3iqido_14-8-rgb_front and then we will move onto the cake
-7bty3iqido_15-8-rgb_front so we are going to trim the edge where the white and the pink meet with this pearl border
-7bty3iqido_16-8-rgb_front and you are going to place them right on that border and go all the way around the cake
-7bty3iqido_17-8-rgb_front remember you are just holding the tip just slightly above the cake so that the frosting will come out and spread a little into a little circle
-7bty3iqido_18-8-rgb_front releasing pressure before you pull up
-7bty3iqido_19-8-rgb_front this makes a nice delicate trim for the edge of the slipper
-7bty3iqido_2-8-rgb_front it is just a regular writing tip
-7bty3iqido_20-8-rgb_front when you finish the beading around the around the shoe you want to make a little bow here
-7bty3iqido_21-8-rgb_front just make a loop and another loop and two little strings coming down
-7bty3iqido_22-8-rgb_front and then just a little dot there for the tie
-7bty3iqido_3-8-rgb_front and how you make pearls is you want to twist your bag
-7bty3iqido_4-8-rgb_front make it nice and tight
-7bty3iqido_5-8-rgb_front and you will make little dots
-7bty3iqido_6-8-rgb_front so you just hold the tip over the paper or the cake about an eighth of an inch and you squeeze out until you get a little pearl
-7bty3iqido_7-8-rgb_front and as soon as it gets about this big then you pull it up
-7bty3iqido_8-8-rgb_front now you do not want to squeeze squeeze squeeze and pull up and squeeze
-7bty3iqido_9-8-rgb_front because you will end up with something that looks like that
-7h7zho_4ao_1-8-rgb_front so we have completed our little pin cushion doll and i think she is so cute she is just a personal little hand made that would make a fun gift for any seamstress that you know
-7h7zho_4ao_2-8-rgb_front this would also be a great little project for a beginning sewer
-7h7zho_4ao_3-8-rgb_front it is very easy just stitching all the way around it and the pattern is very easy and stuffing in
-7h7zho_4ao_4-8-rgb_front this would be a good project maybe to work with like a child you can even use instead of stuffing you can use rice or even a bean bag
-7h7zho_4ao_5-8-rgb_front or as i mentioned before this would also make a great little dog toy and with doll toys you just always want to keep in mind that you do not want to use anything that can be pulled off or get stuck in your throat or anything
-7h7zho_4ao_6-8-rgb_front the same principle applies to children
-7h7zho_4ao_7-8-rgb_front if you are going to be making this doll for a baby then i would just stick with a felt and the embroidery because there is not really any little parts that can be pulled out or anything
-7h7zho_4ao_8-8-rgb_front but i think she is so fantastic and she is going to look so great as my pin cushion
-7h7zho_4ao_9-8-rgb_front she is going to look fantastic on my desk so i hope you had as much fun making her as i did
-7zqo3skaxk_0-8-rgb_front now the first rule the first thing you want to make sure you do not do when giving criticism is do not act in haste
-7zqo3skaxk_1-8-rgb_front and what i mean by that is think about what you say before you say it
-7zqo3skaxk_2-8-rgb_front there is an old saying that i think is real important to remember when we are talking about criticism whether it s written or whether it s spoken
-7zqo3skaxk_3-8-rgb_front you can never take it back
-7zqo3skaxk_4-8-rgb_front so once the words are out there they are out there
-7zqo3skaxk_5-8-rgb_front so think about what you are going to say before you say it
-7zqo3skaxk_6-8-rgb_front if someone is attacking you or something is coming at you it s harder to not jump on that and act very quickly and tell somebody how terrible they are or what a jerk they are or whatever it is
-7zqo3skaxk_7-8-rgb_front but try to stop think about it so that the words that you say are not hurtful and more critical and negative and do not exacerbate the whole situation
-88octs9mps_0-8-rgb_front hi this is nigel with blue griffin handyman and today we are going to talk about how to get rid of the paint smell in your house
-88octs9mps_1-8-rgb_front the first thing to do the best thing to do is to avoid the fumes altogether
-88octs9mps_2-8-rgb_front many paints these days come with a low voc or a no voc mixture and it will tell you on the back of the can like this one here says voc at grams per liter
-88octs9mps_3-8-rgb_front now voc stands for volatile organic compounds and that is what is causing the fumes in your house so what you want to do if you have to use some of these paints with voc in them the best thing to do is to open the windows all the windows in the house and put a fan on one end of the house so you can draw all the fumes out of the house and try to go to the park for the day or something and get out of the house so you do not have the smell those nasty vapors
-88octs9mps_4-8-rgb_front when you are using those type of paints with voc in them definitely use some kind of breathing protection that will filter out those kinds of fumes
-88octs9mps_5-8-rgb_front they are not good for you
-88octs9mps_6-8-rgb_front so that is how to get the paint smell out of your house
-8ayi1n0uwo_0-8-rgb_front hi i am james from reptile rescue service in salt lake city utah
-8ayi1n0uwo_1-8-rgb_front if your turtle will not eat that is the topic of this one this discussion here
-8ayi1n0uwo_10-8-rgb_front so if you have one that has this disease you need to keep em separate
-8ayi1n0uwo_11-8-rgb_front this will affect em on eating and also they will be lazy and want to sleep a lot
-8ayi1n0uwo_2-8-rgb_front there could be a couple of variances of this one
-8ayi1n0uwo_3-8-rgb_front could be if it is a wild caught turtle land turtle or tortoise a lot of time they sense in they sense in the wintertime it is time to hibernate
-8ayi1n0uwo_4-8-rgb_front at this time they will quit eating because if they have food in their belly when they go into hibernation it can be fatal
-8ayi1n0uwo_5-8-rgb_front it will actually ferment or rot and can cause fatality to the turtle or tortoise
-8ayi1n0uwo_6-8-rgb_front another sign of this could be if they have an upper respiratory infection which is like a form of pneumonia to us humans
-8ayi1n0uwo_7-8-rgb_front it makes them weak and sick
-8ayi1n0uwo_8-8-rgb_front if it is a russian tortoise a lot of these carry herpes disease
-8ayi1n0uwo_9-8-rgb_front this is not contagious to humans but it is to other tortoises
-8ej9aomfac_4-8-rgb_front the kids can add glitter to it stickers it is really easy to do and it is great if they are having a tea party with their friends
-8ej9aomfac_5-8-rgb_front you can get rid of all of that old wrapping paper
-8ej9aomfac_6-8-rgb_front and again it is a great recyclable craft if you have birthday party paper from a child is birthday
-8ej9aomfac_7-8-rgb_front pool it all together make a bunch of hats and let the kids run around and really have a good time with them
-8ej9aomfac_8-8-rgb_front and i will go ahead and just place my hat on and say thank you
-8l6l9ffwk8_0-8-rgb_front hi
-8l6l9ffwk8_1-8-rgb_front in this segment we are going to talk about consecutive rolls
-8l6l9ffwk8_2-8-rgb_front and what that means is doing a roll and a roll and a roll and a roll without stopping without breaking any of the any of the motion
-8l6l9ffwk8_3-8-rgb_front and the trick of that is is right when the frisbee comes to your second hand is to push it up right in the right angle so it comes back to your other hand
-8l6l9ffwk8_4-8-rgb_front and it is again it is the using your legs and using your arms
-8l6l9ffwk8_5-8-rgb_front but the last part is the critical part to have it come here so it sets up for your next roll
-8l6l9ffwk8_6-8-rgb_front an example of consecutive rolls here here here here here here here here here here
-8l6l9ffwk8_7-8-rgb_front now if you noticed every time that it came around to this arm i was pushing it up so it was almost right in the right spot for my next roll
-8l6l9ffwk8_8-8-rgb_front i did not have to run around
-8l6l9ffwk8_9-8-rgb_front so the whole key is is that right at the end and that push to make sure that it is set for the next roll
-8xxbfxazyo_1-8-rgb_front now of the characteristics of chameleons is their amazing ability to change color
-8xxbfxazyo_10-8-rgb_front so as far as color changing goes she chameleons go through a breeding stage
-8xxbfxazyo_11-8-rgb_front in the veiled chameleons in males it is called the sunburst phase
-8xxbfxazyo_12-8-rgb_front they turn to bright colors usually very bright very
-8xxbfxazyo_13-8-rgb_front the females turn an orangish or brownish color during breeding season but many females will not display a very obvious change of color during breeding at all
-8xxbfxazyo_14-8-rgb_front a hungry chameleon will often often be trying to blend in with its environment
-8xxbfxazyo_15-8-rgb_front this is when they tend to do that not only for hiding but for making sure that their prey does not see him
-8xxbfxazyo_16-8-rgb_front now it is not just for hiding from enemies they want to make sure that their prey is not aware of their presence either
-8xxbfxazyo_17-8-rgb_front now an angry chameleon such as is displaying right now
-8xxbfxazyo_18-8-rgb_front what she is displaying is the angry colors
-8xxbfxazyo_19-8-rgb_front she is trying to make sure that i know that i am not welcome in her cage
-8xxbfxazyo_2-8-rgb_front it is often thought that chameleons blend in with their environment but this is not the only reason they change color
-8xxbfxazyo_3-8-rgb_front they do change colors with their environment to blend in such as browns for climbing on the trees the greens for matching the leaves and they also turn colors to their mood
-8xxbfxazyo_4-8-rgb_front when they are angry they tend to veiled chameleons tend to get the black stripes with the white spots and the green in between
-8xxbfxazyo_5-8-rgb_front and the sleeping chameleon will turn a bright lime green color with no spots
-8xxbfxazyo_6-8-rgb_front now if she is cold she is whole body is going to turn more of a black color
-8xxbfxazyo_7-8-rgb_front this the dark colors absorb more heat and if she is cool she is going to go sit under her basking light turn a darker color and absorb as much heat as she can
-8xxbfxazyo_8-8-rgb_front now when she is warm when she is too warm she is going to turn a lighter green color sometimes a white color because this is when she wants to expel as much heat as she can
-8xxbfxazyo_9-8-rgb_front this does not happen very often because of the fact that she likes the higher temperatures and where we live we do not get too many high temperatures indoors
-8j9k3t5lkw_0-8-rgb_front dr chris mango hi
-8j9k3t5lkw_1-8-rgb_front this is dr chris mango here in new york city
-8j9k3t5lkw_3-8-rgb_front the next muscle we are going to be taking a look at is the latissimus dorsi
-8j9k3t5lkw_4-8-rgb_front this is another common muscle that you might not know the name for but everybody knows that they work under lats when they go to the gym
-8j9k3t5lkw_5-8-rgb_front now this can also cause a lot of pain in the side here but it can also go into the arm a little bit
-8j9k3t5lkw_6-8-rgb_front let is take a look
-8j9k3t5lkw_7-8-rgb_front okay so the latissimus dorsi connects along the iliac crest up along the thoracic spine here and then up into the shoulder and down
-8j9k3t5lkw_8-8-rgb_front now the muscles through this area you can find trigger points through here and here and that can cause pain that can come all in the side of the spine and down into the arm
-8smpvp08mu_10-8-rgb_front and you may not realize it it may look okay but be something that is just off
-8smpvp08mu_11-8-rgb_front when you master getting the exact curves right which is pretty easy above the waist curve it down below the waist curve it up
-8smpvp08mu_12-8-rgb_front everything falls into place after that
-8smpvp08mu_9-8-rgb_front but same thing with hems and everything your outfit will be completely wrong if you have the curve going the wrong way
-8tit1veinq_0-8-rgb_front right now i am going to show you that colors i want to say cripple some people
-8tit1veinq_1-8-rgb_front they get a mind set that they have to use the same colors over and over and over and over again
-8tit1veinq_10-8-rgb_front okay
-8tit1veinq_11-8-rgb_front what colors do you think going to look good with it
-8tit1veinq_12-8-rgb_front i do not know let is try some yellow
-8tit1veinq_13-8-rgb_front just butt it up right next to it
-8tit1veinq_14-8-rgb_front yeah sure they look good together
-8tit1veinq_15-8-rgb_front you know brown and green and blue are going to look good together because they are earth tones
-8tit1veinq_16-8-rgb_front what about pink
-8tit1veinq_17-8-rgb_front does pink look good with brown
-8tit1veinq_18-8-rgb_front yes it does
-8tit1veinq_19-8-rgb_front it looks very good with brown
-8tit1veinq_2-8-rgb_front what you should do is when you are practicing if you have got multiple colors like i do here i have a tee shirt rack that is got colors on it
-8tit1veinq_20-8-rgb_front you just got to remember that do not be afraid to put colors together
-8tit1veinq_21-8-rgb_front one thing my father taught me was if you have got colors that are opposite of the color wheel and that means if it is a cold color or a hot color meaning red or blue
-8tit1veinq_22-8-rgb_front if you put them together they are going to vibrate against each other and they are going to get your attention and that is the whole point of putting them together is to get your attention
-8tit1veinq_23-8-rgb_front so do not be afraid to put colors together
-8tit1veinq_24-8-rgb_front pink and brown do something cool with the brown letters with a pink background and it will look nice
-8tit1veinq_25-8-rgb_front thank you
-8tit1veinq_3-8-rgb_front and you will see that i have multiple air brushes
-8tit1veinq_4-8-rgb_front at one time i had an air brush on every color
-8tit1veinq_5-8-rgb_front and it just increases speed and efficiency whenever you are painting something
-8tit1veinq_6-8-rgb_front just take a color say i have got brown
-8tit1veinq_7-8-rgb_front just find out what colors look good together with it
-8tit1veinq_8-8-rgb_front i just draw a line of it
-8tit1veinq_9-8-rgb_front right in the middle
-8uwu59w8qe_0-8-rgb_front hi
-8uwu59w8qe_10-8-rgb_front i recommend strongly that original core that we talked about a long time ago have one person who is going to be the coordinator for vending ideally you will have a vendor coordinator and someone also to handle food who may be with food booth or may understand industry
-8uwu59w8qe_11-8-rgb_front it is a very specialized area and you can get yourself into all certain types of hassles if you do not do it right
-8uwu59w8qe_12-8-rgb_front i suggest you getting a vending coordinator
-8uwu59w8qe_13-8-rgb_front one for food and one for vending and work with the vendors the best that they can
-8uwu59w8qe_14-8-rgb_front in the next segment we are going to talk about another money issue which is sponsorship
-8uwu59w8qe_15-8-rgb_front stay with me
-8uwu59w8qe_2-8-rgb_front in this segment i am going to touch on vending
-8uwu59w8qe_3-8-rgb_front how to work with vendors and what they are all about
-8uwu59w8qe_4-8-rgb_front when you go to a festival you will also often see vendors
-8uwu59w8qe_5-8-rgb_front you will see food vendors vendors craft and arts and so on
-8uwu59w8qe_6-8-rgb_front as a producer of the event you need to look at it also as one of your income producers
-8uwu59w8qe_7-8-rgb_front if you realize that each of those vendors might be paying say a and if you have ten of those vendors that is a that your festival has already to work with
-8uwu59w8qe_8-8-rgb_front how many you have will also depend upon your budget and your site and what you can fit in but you need to think in terms of food and vendors being an intricate part of your event
-8uwu59w8qe_9-8-rgb_front food vendors are a whole scene onto themselves because of the complications health requirements heating requirements and cooling requirements and the need for power that they bring into your festival
-916rcqirfy_0-5-rgb_front admittedly my kicks are not the most fancy or flashy in the world
-916rcqirfy_1-5-rgb_front i do not kick people in the head standing up
-916rcqirfy_10-5-rgb_front i could have an attacker dealing with me over on this side and i may have to kick him to stop him from grabbing while i deal with this other attacker
-916rcqirfy_11-5-rgb_front what i might want to do instead of kicking the body like i said here demo is come in and kick the leg out
-916rcqirfy_12-5-rgb_front you can have a lot of good effects kicking someone is knee out just like this
-916rcqirfy_13-5-rgb_front if you are to the side of the person demo kick out the inside of the leg
-916rcqirfy_14-5-rgb_front or you can kick out the outside of the leg demo just like this
-916rcqirfy_15-5-rgb_front now i am doing that really easy because you can damage the person is knee
-916rcqirfy_16_17_18-5-rgb_front but you will see the way the leg folds demo just by kicking on the outside switch your feet or the inside demo just like that
-916rcqirfy_19-5-rgb_front again be very careful of practicing these kicks because you can roll the knee out and twist the ankle and the knee at the same time
-916rcqirfy_2-5-rgb_front if i am going to kick him in the head i am going to knock him down to the ground first and then i will kick him in the head where i do not have to stretch that far
-916rcqirfy_20-5-rgb_front but i think it is a great way to kick bring it up out demo just like this
-916rcqirfy_3-5-rgb_front a side kick is a good technique
-916rcqirfy_4-5-rgb_front a side kick basically the way i do it is i stand sideways to my partner i am going to take a step in cross kick up and out
-916rcqirfy_5-5-rgb_front when i kick i am kicking with the outside edge of my foot here demo and then back
-916rcqirfy_6-5-rgb_front one two
-916rcqirfy_7-5-rgb_front one two three four
-916rcqirfy_8-5-rgb_front my target of course will be anywhere on the body
-916rcqirfy_9-5-rgb_front i prefer to kick in the legs but for this example i am going to kick in the body demo just like this
-96cwdhr4hc_0-5-rgb_front i am using a heavy duty stapler and you want to make sure you test out your stapler on a scrap piece of wood to make sure that you know where the placement of the stapler is going to be because we are on a very narrow strip here and we do not want to miss our mark when we put our stapler in
-96cwdhr4hc_1-5-rgb_front now with these heavy duty staplers you want to place it and put your hand right here to give downward pressure right here because if you do not the stapler tends to want to jump up and the staple will not go in properly
-96cwdhr4hc_10-5-rgb_front just color up those staples it makes a big difference
-96cwdhr4hc_11-5-rgb_front you do not notice them as much
-96cwdhr4hc_2-5-rgb_front so some of them have a little spot on top and they call it a power button and that is what they want you to do is push down and staple
-96cwdhr4hc_3-5-rgb_front and then you have got a good staple right there nice and secure
-96cwdhr4hc_4-5-rgb_front we are going to staple all the way down the edge and put those staples fairly close
-96cwdhr4hc_5-5-rgb_front now when you are going over the whole section you are going to need something to rest the stapler on
-96cwdhr4hc_6-5-rgb_front here i have just put a roll of tape something that i can lean on
-96cwdhr4hc_7-5-rgb_front if you do not use that your stapler is going to go into the hole and it will shoot in the wrong direction
-96cwdhr4hc_8-5-rgb_front so you want to have something to prop up that stapler and we will go about every half inch all the way down the side trying to keep those staples in a nice even row
-96cwdhr4hc_9-5-rgb_front as a finishing touch you might want to take a permanent marker and color over the staples so they do not stand out as much or you can touch it up with a little paint also
-98tdkcf-sy_5-5-rgb_front and most of those dealers are setup with secondary finance companies that deal strictly with people that have bad credit or credit as opposed to the bigger dealerships the big chains the big ford dealerships or the big chevrolet dealerships
-98tdkcf-sy_6-5-rgb_front go to a smaller buy here pay here and most of those will have secondary financing
-98tdkcf-sy_7-5-rgb_front that is exactly how you get a car loan with bad credit or credit
-98tdkcf-sy_8-5-rgb_front again my name is adriel torres and i am the owner of ultimatecredittoday com
-98tdkcf-sy_9-5-rgb_front thank you very much
-9d6kp1tgby_0-8-rgb_front okay the eyes are basically done
-9d6kp1tgby_1-8-rgb_front this is our perfect eye look for goth
-9d6kp1tgby_10-8-rgb_front we do not want the eye brows to look too over done or too powdered so i am just going to fill in a little bit just to get a nice natural arch
-9d6kp1tgby_11-8-rgb_front the eyebrows really shape the face especially when you have such a dramatic eye shadow look
-9d6kp1tgby_12-8-rgb_front you really want to make sure that you do not forget your eyebrows
-9d6kp1tgby_13-8-rgb_front because her eyebrows are a little short i am going to draw just a tiny bit onto the ends just to extend them a little bit
-9d6kp1tgby_14-8-rgb_front add a little more if you want to
-9d6kp1tgby_15-8-rgb_front it is all personal preference
-9d6kp1tgby_16-8-rgb_front again how dark you want your brows to be
-9d6kp1tgby_17-8-rgb_front try to use a color that most closely matches your natural hair color
-9d6kp1tgby_18-8-rgb_front once you get your desired shape take a little brow comb or brow brush and brush through the brows
-9d6kp1tgby_19-8-rgb_front even everything out
-9d6kp1tgby_2-8-rgb_front we are going to do a little bit in the brows
-9d6kp1tgby_20-8-rgb_front blend everything
-9d6kp1tgby_21-8-rgb_front what this does is it takes away the excess powder blends everything in and also you shape your brow at that point to your desired shape
-9d6kp1tgby_22-8-rgb_front look how perfect that brow looks
-9d6kp1tgby_3-8-rgb_front her brows are pretty light
-9d6kp1tgby_4-8-rgb_front they are nicely shaped but they are pretty light
-9d6kp1tgby_5-8-rgb_front we want them to match more of her dark chestnut hair color
-9d6kp1tgby_6-8-rgb_front i am using a powder and a brush
-9d6kp1tgby_7-8-rgb_front you can use a pencil
-9d6kp1tgby_8-8-rgb_front it is all personal preference
-9d6kp1tgby_9-8-rgb_front i am just going to fill in her natural brow line
-9gv_-vrpt8_0-8-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson and what we are talking about right now is using the proper mechanics to become not only a good shooter but a good shooter from the free throw line
-9gv_-vrpt8_1-8-rgb_front so the last step that we have is to finish out your free throw
-9gv_-vrpt8_10-8-rgb_front what we see a lot of players do is they will follow through but then they will pull their hand back and again that is going to pull that basketball back a little bit and not let it go ahead and follow through the proper way
-9gv_-vrpt8_11-8-rgb_front the last thing is we do not want to fall take our shot and fall back off the free throw line
-9gv_-vrpt8_12-8-rgb_front if you shoot and you take a step back it s called negative energy
-9gv_-vrpt8_13-8-rgb_front you are taking energy away from that basketball and not allowing it to go on down
-9gv_-vrpt8_14-8-rgb_front so remember when making a good free throw shot its not just the shot its also how you finish after the free throw that is going to make you a good free throw shooter
-9gv_-vrpt8_2-8-rgb_front if kyle steps up to the line right here and gets himself ready
-9gv_-vrpt8_3-8-rgb_front what we are going to talk about is you have a good base you have a good foundation
-9gv_-vrpt8_4-8-rgb_front you are going to make the shot you are going to follow through at the end of the shot
-9gv_-vrpt8_5-8-rgb_front that is the first thing in finishing
-9gv_-vrpt8_6-8-rgb_front but the most important thing is by using your legs a lot of time you see players come up and shoot their free throw and they stay flat footed and then end up hitting the ball on the front of the rim
-9gv_-vrpt8_7-8-rgb_front what we always want to do is you always want to finish your free throw up on your toes because what that does is when you get up on your toes that is using the bottom of your leg muscles and its giving you just that extra edge to get that ball up and over the rim
-9gv_-vrpt8_8-8-rgb_front the other thing you want to make sure and do is always follow through and end up out in front of you
-9gv_-vrpt8_9-8-rgb_front you never want to end up with the ball up here
-9kic0qscys_0-8-rgb_front allen diwan hi
-9kic0qscys_1-8-rgb_front my name is allen diwan
-9kic0qscys_10-8-rgb_front and it is also cooking the food is also about seeing the color of the food in the dish
-9kic0qscys_11-8-rgb_front you will see the different flavors
-9kic0qscys_12-8-rgb_front you will see the different ingredients that we are going to put in this dish that you see the colors of each and every ingredient and this is part of the appeal
-9kic0qscys_13-8-rgb_front i might add one more tomato of this dish that you can see it is very rustic and you have to make it appetizing you eat with your eyes as well and you want to make this dish as appetizing as possible
-9kic0qscys_14-8-rgb_front so this is quite a straight forward recipe and the ginger garlic we are waiting for the ginger to cook properly
-9kic0qscys_15-8-rgb_front and for more or more minutes we will give leave it for or more minutes and then we will add our tomatoes to this
-9kic0qscys_2-8-rgb_front i am the owner and chef of kashmir indian restaurant in budapest
-9kic0qscys_4-8-rgb_front the dish now we are going to be preparing is called paneer masala
-9kic0qscys_5-8-rgb_front one ingredient that we will be adding also is the tomatoes whilst the ginger and the garlic have been cooked slightly
-9kic0qscys_6-8-rgb_front so give it one more shake stir it once more properly
-9kic0qscys_7-8-rgb_front the onions have been slightly browned now and we added our green ginger garlic and the chilies
-9kic0qscys_8-8-rgb_front we will wait for that to cook and in the meanwhile we will take our tomatoes maybe about of them and we will cut them into cubes
-9kic0qscys_9-8-rgb_front again we do not want tomatoes to be cut into very small cubes because we want to see i mean obviously it will be cooked well with the masala but you will somehow see the redness of the tomato
-9kqrmbaasa_1_2-3-rgb_front as i mentioned earlier most portable electric sanders run on or house current pretty much any extension cord will work
-9kqrmbaasa_3-3-rgb_front these sanders do not require significant amounts of power
-9kqrmbaasa_4-3-rgb_front you do not need a very heavy gauge extension cord your standard i think this is a fourteen gauge extension cord will do
-9kqrmbaasa_5-3-rgb_front but to power it up first make sure your sander is in the off position make sure the power switch is off
-9kqrmbaasa_6-3-rgb_front and then a little helpful thing that i like to do is before i connect my extension cord to help keep it from coming unplugged while you are using it we are going to tie a knot in the cord
-9kqrmbaasa_7-3-rgb_front we will just hold the two come around draw it into a knot and now you can plug it in
-9kqrmbaasa_8-3-rgb_front notice that one pole on the extension cord is larger than the other so it will only go in one way
-9kqrmbaasa_9-3-rgb_front plug it in and you are ready to go
-9tmncfetdo_1-8-rgb_front lesson mascara brush every mascara bottle of course comes with a mascara brush
-9tmncfetdo_2-8-rgb_front they all do come in different shapes and different sizes
-9tmncfetdo_3-8-rgb_front i like this mascara and the best way to apply your mascara and use your mascara brush is to start from the inner most part of your eyelash and wiggle and work your way up to the tip of your eyelash
-9tmncfetdo_4-8-rgb_front this adds fullness to the eyelash without actually not having to use a volumizer mascara
-9tmncfetdo_5-8-rgb_front mascara brushes are sold at drug stores or your beauty supply store and they do come in different sizes like i said and it is best to change your mascara brush because it tends to build up bacteria and to clump
-9tmncfetdo_6-8-rgb_front the best way to prevent clumping is to actually take your mascara brush and if you do see any clumps on your brush is to wipe it off on a napkin or a paper towel that will not leave any residue behind
-9tmncfetdo_7-8-rgb_front it is best not to take your mascara brush and wipe the excess off on the lid of the bottle because that just rubs right back in and that is what causes the clumping and then you will have the clumps left over on your eyelashes
-9tmncfetdo_8-8-rgb_front that is the mascara brush and that is how you use it
-9__f8xkdue_0-8-rgb_front i would like to talk with you now about international stoves
-9__f8xkdue_1-8-rgb_front when you see the word international you would think about going overseas and you may be going into a country where certain fuels are hard to find
-9__f8xkdue_2-8-rgb_front this liquid fuel stove happens to be a white gas stove but they make a version of it that uses multiple fuels
-9__f8xkdue_3-8-rgb_front kerosene some of them will even burn diesel naphta different fuels that might be easier for you to find elsewhere
-9__f8xkdue_4-8-rgb_front this stove right here has a special feature if you do not find an msr cartridge abroad you might find some other ones and they might not have a thread to screw on
-9__f8xkdue_5-8-rgb_front so what this has it has a little catch that goes over top of here and then instead of screwing on it descends down on to the cartridge
-9__f8xkdue_6-8-rgb_front these type of stoves give you a little more latitude of what kind of fuel you can get for them
-9__f8xkdue_7-8-rgb_front if you have any questions on these types of stoves give your outfitter a holler
-9_ji7kwiqy_0-8-rgb_front so the next step in making your clays is going to be to sieve the mixture
-9_ji7kwiqy_1-8-rgb_front now i have got one of these large fancy sieves it is got brushes on the bottom and it turns and then it comes with screens at different meshes this one is mesh the higher the number the finer the particles so would be tighter woven than this one is
-9_ji7kwiqy_2-8-rgb_front anywhere from about to is appropriate for most glazes a might not be fine enough and you do not want to go too much thinner than a because some of your materials might not be small enough to go through
-9_ji7kwiqy_3-8-rgb_front so you are going to mix just stir up again feel the bottom you want to have a large spoon
-9_ji7kwiqy_4-8-rgb_front make sure that there is no big chunks kind of laying in weight down there
-9_ji7kwiqy_5-8-rgb_front and then you will take a pitcher and get a scoop poor it right into your sieve
-9_ji7kwiqy_6-8-rgb_front and then with this one you just turn the brushes and that pushes the material through the screen
-9_ji7kwiqy_7-8-rgb_front if you do not have a big fancy one like this with the brushes a lot of times wear a rubber clove and just kind of use your hand to work the materials through the screen that works also
-9_ji7kwiqy_8-8-rgb_front so i am going to go through this entire bucket and just keep scooping and pushing it through the screen until i have got the whole thing complete
-9byto0hubm_9-8-rgb_front that is how you do it i am russ handler and i need to make a phone call
-9nbmsvp2co_0-8-rgb_front okay it is efficiently chilled just brought it out of the refrigerator
-9nbmsvp2co_1-8-rgb_front it was in there about twenty five minutes or so
-9nbmsvp2co_10-8-rgb_front tastes dearly ooh okay
-9nbmsvp2co_11-8-rgb_front so that is what you look for just nice solid fudge
-9nbmsvp2co_12-8-rgb_front again put it in the freezer if you need to
-9nbmsvp2co_13-8-rgb_front i will say that if you want to take this with you somewhere try to keep it in a frig
-9nbmsvp2co_14-8-rgb_front you know if you take it to the office maybe as a little dessert after your lunch that is a great idea
-9nbmsvp2co_15-8-rgb_front just pop it back in the frig when you get to work
-9nbmsvp2co_16-8-rgb_front because again that coconut oil is very sensitive to temperature
-9nbmsvp2co_17-8-rgb_front so it is perfectly congealed for me and solidified but as soon as i am done you know cutting it and showing you what it looks like i am going to put it back in the freezer
-9nbmsvp2co_18-8-rgb_front so just keep that in mind
-9nbmsvp2co_2-8-rgb_front and you can pop it in the freezer if you need to that is okay too
-9nbmsvp2co_3-8-rgb_front you will see that it is not even
-9nbmsvp2co_4-8-rgb_front we poured it in and it was smooth and now it looks like a rough rugged terrain that you would need a four wheel drive to go over
-9nbmsvp2co_5-8-rgb_front but that is okay
-9nbmsvp2co_6-8-rgb_front fudge is homemade at least it should be so that is okay not a big deal
-9nbmsvp2co_7-8-rgb_front i personally do not care what my fudge looks like as long as it tastes good
-9nbmsvp2co_8-8-rgb_front it even has a little ridge right here that cracked you know not did not crack but it has a little ridge that broke off
-9nbmsvp2co_9-8-rgb_front that is okay
-9umtjvgsqk_4-8-rgb_front what will happen is the contact lens will stick to a wet surface better than a dry surface
-9umtjvgsqk_5-8-rgb_front take it in
-9umtjvgsqk_6-8-rgb_front put it on the fingertip move it over and pinch it off
-9zb8cv_wjk_10-8-rgb_front you can sand that glue smooth until you feel comfortable putting your other piece on to make a smooth transition between the two pieces
-9zb8cv_wjk_11-8-rgb_front once you get the glue off you just simply simply stick your other adhesive tile down in its place and you have a fixed adhesive tile
-9zb8cv_wjk_12-8-rgb_front now there are other options if you are having trouble getting the adhesive tile off the floor you can actually soak a rag in solvent and drape the rag over the top of the floor and cover it with plastic to keep the fumes from getting out and that will actually work on dissolving that glue underneath and may make it a little bit easier for you to get that piece out
-9zb8cv_wjk_13-8-rgb_front my name is ryan parker with parker home renovations and you can contact me at parkerhomerenovations com
-9zb8cv_wjk_4-8-rgb_front so you may have to replace it with something close to it
-9zb8cv_wjk_5-8-rgb_front now the first thing you are going to need to do when repairing one of these vinyl floor flooring pieces is take your utility knife and you are actually going to want to cut off a corner of the tile
-9zb8cv_wjk_6-8-rgb_front so you are going to want to do like that and then if you can in some cases you could actually get into the that piece with the end of your razor blade and pick it out like this
-9zb8cv_wjk_7-8-rgb_front if you are lucky enough to be able to do that then from there you can pretty much pick at it and tear that piece out
-9zb8cv_wjk_8-8-rgb_front if you can not get to it like that you may have to get creative with a like a chisel of some sort and just get a hammer and chisel it up and then you can get a chisel from the other side and chisel that piece out
-9zb8cv_wjk_9-8-rgb_front once you get that piece out then you will have to get whatever glue is on on the floor off and how you can do that is you can use any kind of a cleaner to actually soak that area for a little while and you can scrape it up with a razor or you can sand that glue if that glue is really dry
-afid_p6yu0_1-8-rgb_front in this series we are learning all about flower bulbs
-afid_p6yu0_10-8-rgb_front when in doubt go sideways as another rule and they multiply quickly
-afid_p6yu0_11-8-rgb_front but i found with all bulbs they like to be in groups just like people do
-afid_p6yu0_12-8-rgb_front so if you put three in a triangle it will do much better than one by itself
-afid_p6yu0_13-8-rgb_front they will do a lot more water too
-afid_p6yu0_14-8-rgb_front i put em in some of the boggier areas in my yard and they have done well too
-afid_p6yu0_15-8-rgb_front and it will do well in drought conditions
-afid_p6yu0_16-8-rgb_front they are a plant that probably never needs to be watered and you will never lose em
-afid_p6yu0_17-8-rgb_front just a beautiful plant
-afid_p6yu0_18-8-rgb_front sometimes they are called montbretia
-afid_p6yu0_19-8-rgb_front so montbretia is the same as a crocosmia and these were hybridized the lucifer in england back in and i like to think that was the same year i was born
-afid_p6yu0_2-8-rgb_front and some of my favorite flower bulbs are the crocosmias and within the crocosmias the lucifer
-afid_p6yu0_20-8-rgb_front so they have been around for not a long time really in botanical history but they are really a smash
-afid_p6yu0_21-8-rgb_front the next bulb that we will talk about is crocosmia carmine brilliant
-afid_p6yu0_3-8-rgb_front i love crocosmia lucifer
-afid_p6yu0_4-8-rgb_front it is a native to south africa so it does very well in the pacific northwest and it almost grows as a weed
-afid_p6yu0_5-8-rgb_front it really likes full hot sun and good drainage and hummingbirds love it
-afid_p6yu0_6-8-rgb_front i mean once you have got a group of crocosmia you will have thousands of hummingbirds in your yard
-afid_p6yu0_7-8-rgb_front and they are easy bulb to recognize and easy bulb to plant
-afid_p6yu0_8-8-rgb_front they look like a hershey is kiss candy and there is a root side and bullseye side
-afid_p6yu0_9-8-rgb_front so the bullseye side goes up
-akdg2aydw4_0-8-rgb_front so next getting on a step ladder we are going to stand up here and start putting on our hillsides using a brush
-akdg2aydw4_1-8-rgb_front nice brush
-akdg2aydw4_10-8-rgb_front now this is going to be more detail put on
-akdg2aydw4_11-8-rgb_front you can see here where it is get the line really fine
-akdg2aydw4_12-8-rgb_front but that also means the paint could be a little thin
-akdg2aydw4_13-8-rgb_front so be prepared for this even if you did not have to with the rest of the base layer here
-akdg2aydw4_14-8-rgb_front be prepared to have to put on multiple coats
-akdg2aydw4_15-8-rgb_front which again allowing about a day to maybe even two days to dry between coats
-akdg2aydw4_2-8-rgb_front i generally recommend being to inches wide
-akdg2aydw4_3-8-rgb_front and what we are going to do is you notice that the line here is really blocky
-akdg2aydw4_4-8-rgb_front horizon lines do not look like this
-akdg2aydw4_5-8-rgb_front that is okay though
-akdg2aydw4_6-8-rgb_front because what we are going to do
-akdg2aydw4_7-8-rgb_front get lots of paint on your brush here and we are going to start coloring in the hills
-akdg2aydw4_8-8-rgb_front see like this nice rise and fall i am getting
-akdg2aydw4_9-8-rgb_front and we are going to keep extending this throughout with gentle rises and falls
-ap1d_fhmem_0-8-rgb_front alright the drink we are about to make is called flaming giraffe that sounds sad does not it it is actually a very tasty shot
-ap1d_fhmem_1-8-rgb_front alright we are going to get something that can fit a double shot in it so this glass will do here
-ap1d_fhmem_2-8-rgb_front and we are going to measure out ounces of kahlua and make sure you add the alcohols in this order okay there we go ounces of kahlua and one ounce of butterscotch schnapps there we go and the last thing you are going to do is add ounce of proof rum there we go
-ap1d_fhmem_3-8-rgb_front and now grab a match or a lighter and some friends to watch go ahead and set the drink on fire the should light pretty easily and let it sit enjoy the luster of the flames blow it out and take it down
-ap1d_fhmem_4-8-rgb_front flaming giraffe bottoms up
-auij6-uezm_0-8-rgb_front and you have learned today a lot of different ways to set up adaptable seating adaptable paddles paddling techniques and so forth for adaptive canoeing programs for people with disabilities
-auij6-uezm_1-8-rgb_front the neat thing about this is a lot of these adaptive and accessible points we have made today can also be set up for other programs such as kayaking or even white water rafting
-auij6-uezm_2-8-rgb_front a lot of this stuff just takes a little bit of patience and innovation but for example this adaptive paddle with just these good old bike tire grips can be used for white water rafting to help somebody grip the paddle while rafting or even the chosen valley seat like i mentioned before the seat can also be attached to a raft frame
-auij6-uezm_3-8-rgb_front we do not have a raft here with us today but again just use a little bit of innovation and some patience to help modify a way to adjust the seat to the a rack frame and we have taken it like i said before down a five day rafting trip down cataract canyon which is full of much larger rapids
-auij6-uezm_4-8-rgb_front so it is very durable and you know a lot of these systems can also be set up for kayaking
-auij6-uezm_5-8-rgb_front just look at the kayak you are using look at the raft you are using your participant needs and just sort of adjust from there
-avtt8kl-fs_16-8-rgb_front we will take our measuring tool
-avtt8kl-fs_17-8-rgb_front see how far off we are or how on we are and you can see we are right on with that
-avtt8kl-fs_18-8-rgb_front now we it is still attached to the hump and we are going to take that off in the same way that we took off the other one
-avtt8kl-fs_19-8-rgb_front we are going to create a little grove and we are going to put a piece of dental floss on there
-avtt8kl-fs_20-8-rgb_front get a grip on it and just draw the dental floss through and as you can see it just released and then we are going to place our fingers on the side pop it off and stick over by the other piece
-avtt8kl-fs_21-8-rgb_front now we have completed two parts of the lid
-avtt8kl-fs_22-8-rgb_front we have completed the lower part the base and the top part
-avtt8kl-fs_23-8-rgb_front next we are going to create the little handle that sits on the top
-avtt8kl-fs_9-8-rgb_front for the sake of what we are doing today i am going to go ahead and say that is about as much as i want riding on the edges there
-azvqxtwgg0_0-8-rgb_front now that i have drawn the size of paper that i want to use i like to get this paper just to where i can just work with this paper
-azvqxtwgg0_1-8-rgb_front so basically i am going to use this razor blade knife and this metal ruler which you can see it has a cork on the bottom of it which actually gives it space from the paper
-azvqxtwgg0_10-8-rgb_front there is no rush when you are using this blade
-azvqxtwgg0_11-8-rgb_front that is the key point i am trying to make
-azvqxtwgg0_12-8-rgb_front and i will just do the same thing i just set the ruler to the right
-azvqxtwgg0_13-8-rgb_front set the blade in the corner
-azvqxtwgg0_14-8-rgb_front slowly drag
-azvqxtwgg0_15-8-rgb_front and you may have to score it a couple of times because it is a thicker paper so it did not separate
-azvqxtwgg0_16-8-rgb_front so what i will do is repeat the process
-azvqxtwgg0_17-8-rgb_front which on this paper it usually takes two
-azvqxtwgg0_18-8-rgb_front two scores
-azvqxtwgg0_19-8-rgb_front turn this back
-azvqxtwgg0_2-8-rgb_front and one thing that it is good for is if you are especially if you are using ink pens or markers you have probably noticed when you do a line on a ruler that is flat to the paper it smears
-azvqxtwgg0_20-8-rgb_front then you can see that it separated on the second score
-azvqxtwgg0_21-8-rgb_front do the same thing on the long side
-azvqxtwgg0_22-8-rgb_front and this one is going to be feisty and i am going to have to do a third one
-azvqxtwgg0_23-8-rgb_front and this is being really feisty
-azvqxtwgg0_24-8-rgb_front there we go
-azvqxtwgg0_25-8-rgb_front so now this is the actual piece that i am going to use
-azvqxtwgg0_26-8-rgb_front so i am going to set that there
-azvqxtwgg0_27-8-rgb_front this drawing table actually has a cutting mat that i bought and put that on there to fit to size so it is like self healing
-azvqxtwgg0_28-8-rgb_front you can get that at your art store as well
-azvqxtwgg0_3-8-rgb_front that little bit of space will prevent the marker from smearing the edge of the border that you are doing
-azvqxtwgg0_4-8-rgb_front but in this case i am going to use it for cutting out the paper
-azvqxtwgg0_5-8-rgb_front so i am going to line it up on my outside edge
-azvqxtwgg0_6-8-rgb_front and be very careful when you are using these knives because they do not play around
-azvqxtwgg0_7-8-rgb_front they are very sharp
-azvqxtwgg0_8-8-rgb_front so once i get it to where i want it and i am just going to set the blade at the corner and i am going to slowly put pressure and just drag it down while i am holding the ruler in place to keep a nice straight line
-azvqxtwgg0_9-8-rgb_front then i will come over here and for me personally i like to pull the blade towards me but slowly because you do not want to
-ah1r8onmmm_0-8-rgb_front as you can see i have put down a few of the pieces now of my bottom layer i am going to move on to what i consider to be my next layer
-ah1r8onmmm_1-8-rgb_front so again laying out some of my mixed medium onto my plexiglass board
-ah1r8onmmm_2-8-rgb_front laying my piece out because it keeps it steady for me
-ah1r8onmmm_3-8-rgb_front lifting it up in the corner with my brush lifting it over and you know you are going to have a little bit of messiness it is going to get on to your fingers
-ah1r8onmmm_4-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that though in between when are using different tools and stuff you are being careful not to get too much on everything else because it is a lot to clean up later
-ah1r8onmmm_5-8-rgb_front so i push it down with my fingers and i go right to my rag to wipe my fingers off again lay some more down and you can see i am working fairly quickly and the reason for this is when you have these adhesives laying down to the board acrylic gel mediums tend to dry very quickly just as acrylic paints do
-ah1r8onmmm_6-8-rgb_front ok get that piece up so i am going for reinforcements with my there it goes
-ah1r8onmmm_7-8-rgb_front sometimes it gets a little stuck always wipe the edge though of your exacto blade off that blade is going to end up tending to be a blade that your not really going to be able to use for cutting much anymore so you may want to have two of the tools available to you so that in case one of them you want to just keep that open for cutting and the other one you can use for lifting the materials up when they get stuck
-ahzpejvexq_0-5-rgb_front what i will be demonstrating here is the power dumbbell chest presses
-ahzpejvexq_1-5-rgb_front you want to do this flat on the ground here take two dumbbells put them on to the side of the body
-ahzpejvexq_2-5-rgb_front what you want to do is power up flex the chest come down all the way to the ground flat against the surface hold it for about one to two seconds power back up
-ahzpejvexq_3-5-rgb_front flex on top down for about one to two seconds and power back up
-ahzpejvexq_4-5-rgb_front you want to continue this motion here for about eight to ten reps and about three to four sets
-ahzpejvexq_5-5-rgb_front so you see this is a power movement it is good to try to use heavy weights on this
-ahzpejvexq_6-5-rgb_front this will help in building some thickness in the chest
-ahzpejvexq_7-5-rgb_front again when then flat on the ground power it up
-ahzpejvexq_8-5-rgb_front and that is how you do power dumbbell chest presses
-aiz9jyxt4g_0-8-rgb_front sponges and the wire tool are tools you use every time you throw as well
-aiz9jyxt4g_1-8-rgb_front a wire tool is what removes your piece from the bat or from the wheel and without the wire tool there is no way to disconnect the clay that adheres to the surface when you are throwing it from the surface
-aiz9jyxt4g_10-8-rgb_front so this is my favorite choice of sponges
-aiz9jyxt4g_2-8-rgb_front so i use i usually get probably one a month just because you can see i have had this not too long and it is already starting to kind of warp and i like the new crisp ones
-aiz9jyxt4g_3-8-rgb_front they are very inexpensive easy to get
-aiz9jyxt4g_4-8-rgb_front sponges are a real personal choice as well
-aiz9jyxt4g_5-8-rgb_front you have got natural and synthetic
-aiz9jyxt4g_6-8-rgb_front i usually use pretty small ones unless i am throwing something really large and then sometimes i will even use one each one in each hand
-aiz9jyxt4g_7-8-rgb_front synthetics are just obviously rough
-aiz9jyxt4g_8-8-rgb_front they seem to last a little better but i really like the smoothness of the natural sponges plus this angle i can get sometimes i will even cut my sponges actually just to get that edge that i need for certain shapes
-aiz9jyxt4g_9-8-rgb_front this one i have not cut and it fits perfectly in my hand
-ajh5hdqsi4_0-8-rgb_front hi
-ajh5hdqsi4_2-8-rgb_front from the moment that you decide to sell your home it is time to start thinking about your marketing strategy
-ajh5hdqsi4_3-8-rgb_front staging should be an interval part of your marketing strategy
-ajh5hdqsi4_4-8-rgb_front if you decide to sell your home then you want to contact a stager approximately to days before you anticipate putting it on a market
-ajh5hdqsi4_5-8-rgb_front there are several reasons why it is so critical
-ajh5hdqsi4_6-8-rgb_front first and foremost you want to allow a stager and your real estate agent enough of time to prepare your home before it goes on the market
-ajh5hdqsi4_7-8-rgb_front sometimes there is work that could be done to paint to work on the landscaping to organize the home prior to selling to declutter the home and we even sometimes your home so that when it is time to move out of your house you are that much further ahead in the moving process
-ajh5hdqsi4_8-8-rgb_front by working with a certified stager like k nicole redesign you can have a full service approach during one of the most stressful times in your life
-b0guedqaoy_0-8-rgb_front so this is this is clip one and its about how to pick a suitable idea to make a glass mosaic
-b0guedqaoy_1-8-rgb_front i do not know how to explain this except that sometimes ideas just come into my head out of someplace
-b0guedqaoy_10-8-rgb_front or even pictures in the paper
-b0guedqaoy_11-8-rgb_front anything a scene you might see take a photograph of it
-b0guedqaoy_12-8-rgb_front i have done that too
-b0guedqaoy_13-8-rgb_front i have taken photographs of things and used that as a basis
-b0guedqaoy_14-8-rgb_front so those are some of the ways that you can use to start with
-b0guedqaoy_2-8-rgb_front or else i think maybe people would like to see something that is more abstract and i just kinda just have fun with the glass and add other materials to it and so on
-b0guedqaoy_3-8-rgb_front other times i see pictures of something like i saw a picture of a beatles on abbey road and i though boy that would be neat to do that in glass
-b0guedqaoy_4-8-rgb_front or pictures of some horses i saw in the paper that were they had their noses together looked like they were kissing and i thought that was really sweet
-b0guedqaoy_5-8-rgb_front or else sometimes i see a picture of horse races like this in the paper
-b0guedqaoy_6-8-rgb_front and i think boy that would be neat how could i put that all together in a horse race
-b0guedqaoy_7-8-rgb_front so one of the ways you can get ideas for doing a project like this is to maybe scan over some art books
-b0guedqaoy_8-8-rgb_front there is a lot of art books that are out there and all the old masters and different people or more modern things
-b0guedqaoy_9-8-rgb_front whatever you might learn
-b1pa__pemg_0-8-rgb_front hi i am ann myrick and today i am going to show you how to arrange your china cabinet
-b1pa__pemg_1-8-rgb_front now one thing that i am big on is not putting glass sorry with glass
-b1pa__pemg_10-8-rgb_front this one a lot of times i will leave the door open and then i will hang a picture or i will hang something on the door but then also you can shut it and when you shut it you see all the pieces without seeing just clear glass
-b1pa__pemg_11-8-rgb_front this is ann myrick and those are ways to work with your china cabinet
-b1pa__pemg_2-8-rgb_front this has a glass door and when i see china cabinets that only have many many times what people will do is people will not add weight
-b1pa__pemg_3-8-rgb_front glasses clear glasses do not have any weight with them so if you put glass in your china cabinet you are not creating weight you are not creating interest
-b1pa__pemg_4-8-rgb_front what i like to do with my china cabinets or the ones that have glass is i like to put solid colors interesting pieces bigger pieces in it to create interest and to give color
-b1pa__pemg_5-8-rgb_front i have a collection of mccoy and what i did on this one you will see that i can barely see it but there is an old mirror up here that reflects the yellow back into it and then what i did is i grouped like colors
-b1pa__pemg_6-8-rgb_front when you have a collection that has a lot of different colors to it you want your eye to be able to move over it smoothly and if you had a yellow one and a white one and a green one and a yellow one you would be really choppy and so what i did in this is i grouped i put all the colors in it but i grouped them together so as you are looking at it you see the yellow and your eye goes all the way across and you see the white and you see the greens and blues
-b1pa__pemg_7-8-rgb_front you can put books and really put antique books and a few bigger pieces
-b1pa__pemg_8-8-rgb_front i do not like to put a lot of little things in china cabinets
-b1pa__pemg_9-8-rgb_front you can use a china cabinet as an organizational piece but just play with it and make it look interesting

-babpsewa54_19-3-rgb_front so they are matching there
-babpsewa54_2-3-rgb_front i always start out with a flat surface
-babpsewa54_20-3-rgb_front i have two sides going right down here
-babpsewa54_21-3-rgb_front i have made a fold
-babpsewa54_22-3-rgb_front now what i want to do is i want to take the bottom and i am going to fold this up
-babpsewa54_23-3-rgb_front i am moving the cardboard up
-babpsewa54_24-3-rgb_front fold this bottom up to the center like so
-babpsewa54_25-3-rgb_front now i am going to slide out my cardboard piece put it to the side
-babpsewa54_26-3-rgb_front all that is left to do is fold one more time

-bfcj9zmfoo_1-8-rgb_front okay i am going to lay this exactly on here where we want it and kind of hold on a little bit
-bfcj9zmfoo_10-8-rgb_front oh that is pretty good
-bfcj9zmfoo_11-8-rgb_front you see what i am doing here
-bfcj9zmfoo_12-8-rgb_front when it starts to come up on the wax paper you just kind of press it down a little more
-bfcj9zmfoo_13-8-rgb_front i mean look at this
-bfcj9zmfoo_14-8-rgb_front wow
-bfcj9zmfoo_15-8-rgb_front that is nice
-bfcj9zmfoo_16-8-rgb_front wow i have not had one work that easily ever and that is in front of the camera
-bfcj9zmfoo_17-8-rgb_front nice
-bfcj9zmfoo_18-8-rgb_front okay we are going to show you what this looks like
-bfcj9zmfoo_19-8-rgb_front and this is our chocolate cracker
-bfcj9zmfoo_2-8-rgb_front we flipped it and now we can put the shelf back like that
-bfcj9zmfoo_20-8-rgb_front and as i said i do not use oil
-bfcj9zmfoo_21-8-rgb_front there was a raw cracker that i tried recently and it was kind of a crepe and it had oil in it and it is just not my preference
-bfcj9zmfoo_22-8-rgb_front so if that does not bother you some of us are very sensitive to oils
-bfcj9zmfoo_23-8-rgb_front when i consume oils i try to have them in the food that they are in
-bfcj9zmfoo_24-8-rgb_front so that would be an avocado or nuts or a coconut but separated oils have to be really careful with for me personally
-bfcj9zmfoo_25-8-rgb_front so look at how beautiful this is without any oil at all
-bfcj9zmfoo_26-8-rgb_front and of course we used the coconut butter that was a lot of the oil
-bfcj9zmfoo_27-8-rgb_front we have nuts in there and we have the flax and that kept it together beautifully
-bfcj9zmfoo_28-8-rgb_front and now we are going to go over to the dehydrator
-bfcj9zmfoo_3-8-rgb_front okay
-bfcj9zmfoo_4-8-rgb_front now here is the part where we are going to peel it back and what i am letting the cracker known here is that i need him to let go
-bfcj9zmfoo_5-8-rgb_front doing a little spiritual work on my cracker
-bfcj9zmfoo_6-8-rgb_front everybody is a healer in sedona
-bfcj9zmfoo_7-8-rgb_front okay so we are going to start work

-bfcj9zmfoo_9-8-rgb_front and there we go it is coming off nicely
-bkq3iobb9k_0-3-rgb_front okay i am giving my speech now
-bkq3iobb9k_1-3-rgb_front okay i am giving my speech with my note cards
-bkq3iobb9k_10-3-rgb_front holding the note card or the paper in front of your face
-bkq3iobb9k_11-3-rgb_front you can not hold that in front of your face
-bkq3iobb9k_12-3-rgb_front i can not build a relationship with you if i can not see your face
-bkq3iobb9k_13-3-rgb_front another thing you have got to remember to breathe like i talked about last time or you will be up here giving your speech and i will be so focused on your papers that i will not listen to you
-bkq3iobb9k_14-3-rgb_front okay hold your note cards use your note cards keep them down here
-bkq3iobb9k_15-3-rgb_front and something else that is really important and i see this a lot with note cards
-bkq3iobb9k_16-3-rgb_front you drop your note cards you lose your place never ever apologize
-bkq3iobb9k_17-3-rgb_front never ever in the middle of your speech tell me what a bad job you are doing or how bad i must think you are or how sorry you are because none of that is true
-bkq3iobb9k_18-3-rgb_front visualize success remember
-bkq3iobb9k_19-3-rgb_front all you have to say is excuse me just a minute and if you are funny you can make a joke
-bkq3iobb9k_2-3-rgb_front we are going to talk about note cards people
-bkq3iobb9k_20-3-rgb_front remember only if you are funny
-bkq3iobb9k_21-3-rgb_front so note cards are a really important tool but keep them organized
-bkq3iobb9k_22-3-rgb_front that way they can keep your organized
-bkq3iobb9k_23-3-rgb_front keep them out of your face and maybe you even put your hands down so that i do not see you shaking
-bkq3iobb9k_3-3-rgb_front note cards are a great thing to use and most people prefer small cards for note cards
-bkq3iobb9k_4-3-rgb_front but a lot of people like to work straight off a piece of paper off of their outline
-bkq3iobb9k_5-3-rgb_front now there is a few problems with note cards and i want to warn you about them
-bkq3iobb9k_6-3-rgb_front that is one
-bkq3iobb9k_7-3-rgb_front you might drop them and then what happens you are already nervous you are scrambling you are scrambling okay okay okay i got it
-bkq3iobb9k_8-3-rgb_front i am ready to go
-bkq3iobb9k_9-3-rgb_front and that would be problem two
-brsdqmci0w_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to go over the best time to exercise
-brsdqmci0w_1-8-rgb_front now there is so many studies telling you different things about different times about eating different meals and what is going to be best for different people
-brsdqmci0w_2-8-rgb_front i just want you to focus on you what is good for you
-brsdqmci0w_3-8-rgb_front if you are a morning person exercise in the morning if you are a night person you get a big kick at night exercise at night
-bwrifad4_s_1-8-rgb_front we have different receipts to show you a peanut butter fudge pie and a peanut butter meringue pie
-bwrifad4_s_2-8-rgb_front the peanut butter fudge pie is made with a cream cheese peanut butter filling and the peanut butter meringue pie is made with a peanut butter and pudding filling and topped with a nice meringue
-bwrifad4_s_3-8-rgb_front the first pie we would be making today is a peanut butter fudge pie it has a creamy peanut butter filling a fudgy layer of chocolate ganache and a crunchy graham cracker crust
-bwrifad4_s_4-8-rgb_front let is get our ingredients together to make sure we have everything we need
-bwrifad4_s_5-8-rgb_front for the graham cracker crust we will be using cups of ground up graham crackers this cups is also package of the graham crackers ground up or ounces if you want to weigh it
-bwrifad4_s_6-8-rgb_front you can buy it ground up or you can buy it the cracker form
-bwrifad4_s_7-8-rgb_front cup of sugar and cup of margarine
-bwrifad4_s_8-8-rgb_front for the ganache layer we are going to use a ganache layer and a ganache topping we are using ounces of the semi sweet chocolate and a cup of cream
-bwrifad4_s_9-8-rgb_front for the peanut butter cream mixture we are using a cup of confectioner is sugar cup of creamy peanut butter i am using the natural type peanut butter a teaspoon of vanilla ounces of cream cheese you can use the creamy cream cheese or you can use the block style both would work fine and cup of whipping cream
-bhmzw-pem0_0-8-rgb_front at this point we are talking about securing the artwork to the thermographic paper
-bhmzw-pem0_1-8-rgb_front i personally glove up when i do this because of the purple ink seems just to get everywhere
-bhmzw-pem0_10-8-rgb_front and we have two choices that we can use
-bhmzw-pem0_11-8-rgb_front we can use one a ball point pen or we can use a mechanical pencil
-bhmzw-pem0_12-8-rgb_front the ball point pen is usually better because you can press harder and it gets a better transfer on the hand drawing of these stencils
-bhmzw-pem0_13-8-rgb_front but now the mechanical pencil is a finer type
-bhmzw-pem0_14-8-rgb_front and in this particular case that is what we need
-bhmzw-pem0_15-8-rgb_front so i am going to use the mechanical pencil on this particular one
-bhmzw-pem0_16-8-rgb_front i am going to press hard and i am going to get the nice crisp detail
-bhmzw-pem0_17-8-rgb_front and i am going to show you how to do that
-bhmzw-pem0_2-8-rgb_front so at this point i got gloves on i have got the thermograph paper cut to size
-bhmzw-pem0_3-8-rgb_front i have got the customer is artwork that i have positioned vertically as opposed to horizontally
-bhmzw-pem0_4-8-rgb_front which he picked the font out online
-bhmzw-pem0_5-8-rgb_front so i am going to secure it to the paper here by doing this
-bhmzw-pem0_6-8-rgb_front using some surgical tape and you do not want the image to shift around because you do not want any ghosting of the images
-bhmzw-pem0_7-8-rgb_front as you can see some of this line work here is very detailed and very defined
-bhmzw-pem0_8-8-rgb_front and you know it is a very simple piece but there is no room for error with this
-bhmzw-pem0_9-8-rgb_front so what we do is we secure the artwork to here using surgical tape
-bo59kwo7vc_0-8-rgb_front there is a difference between real goals and fake goals
-bo59kwo7vc_1-8-rgb_front in order to come across as passionate about your platform you must have real goals
-bo59kwo7vc_2-8-rgb_front an example of an empty goal would be i plan to make a difference in the lives of children because they are our future
-bo59kwo7vc_3-8-rgb_front and what i have just demonstrated does not tell anyone that i know anything about my platform so let me rephrase it in a more specific way
-bo59kwo7vc_4-8-rgb_front i plan to help the children of this neighborhood who are experiencing neglect and poverty because i have been there myself
-bo59kwo7vc_5-8-rgb_front i want to form an after school program that involves at risk teens be able to overcome their differences so that we can bridge the gaps of our society and our future
-bo59kwo7vc_6-8-rgb_front be confident about your goals and let them know that this is something that you want to do
-bo59kwo7vc_7-8-rgb_front be confident about your goals and state specifically how you plan to reach those goals
-brxzweb3e8_1-8-rgb_front often clients tell me they get really sore in their wrists so i am going to at least teach you some tricks of the trade to keep the energy focused on the forearms and out of the wrists when you are balancing on the hands which is what is going to happen in our next frames
-brxzweb3e8_10-8-rgb_front that is the way to stay out of the wrists
-brxzweb3e8_2-8-rgb_front so spreading the fingers wide root down with the first knuckle of the first finger and she is already doing that as opposed to can you show them the opposite of that yeah a lifted knuckle and closed fingers even
-brxzweb3e8_3-8-rgb_front that puts a lot of pressure in the wrist so spread it long and let that energy radiate out through radiate out through the fingertips and then press into the floor like you are pushing the floor down with the fingertips
-brxzweb3e8_4-8-rgb_front now she is got a real firm hold on the forearms
-brxzweb3e8_5-8-rgb_front that is a great way to do that
-brxzweb3e8_6-8-rgb_front the other thing is to keep the shoulder directly above the wrist not forward from it
-brxzweb3e8_7-8-rgb_front when she moves the weight forward that puts a lot more stress on the wrists so we will come back and all of your arm bouncing will generally have will bend the elbow to keep this crease at a ninety degree angle so when we come forward bending the elbow stop right there so you can see there is a ninety degree angle here and through the shoulder
-brxzweb3e8_8-8-rgb_front and then come back up very nice
-brxzweb3e8_9-8-rgb_front let is take it back hips to heels
-bz0bnwqae4_0-5-rgb_front bryan billhimer hi
-bz0bnwqae4_10-5-rgb_front i have a few different ones here
-bz0bnwqae4_11-5-rgb_front differ in thickness and size
-bz0bnwqae4_12-5-rgb_front that is a medium pick
-bz0bnwqae4_13-5-rgb_front i like to actually these smaller ones that are even thicker cause i do not when you pick a string they will bend these do not
-bz0bnwqae4_14-5-rgb_front these might bend have a little more give in em but whatever you feel most comfortable with
-bz0bnwqae4_15-5-rgb_front and we are also going to need a couple of sheets of notebook paper and a pen and if you have a music stand handy that would be good too
-bz0bnwqae4_16-5-rgb_front so now we are going to go into a little bit of knowledge about the parts and terminology of the guitar
-bz0bnwqae4_2-5-rgb_front okay
-bz0bnwqae4_3-5-rgb_front so the first thing we are going to do is talk about some of the things you are going to need
-bz0bnwqae4_4-5-rgb_front obviously you are going to need a guitar
-bz0bnwqae4_5-5-rgb_front and this little lesson is not specific really to electric or acoustic guitar so either is fine
-bz0bnwqae4_6-5-rgb_front some things will as far as the equipment we are using might apply to electric guitar but the lesson itself it can be done on electric or acoustic
-bz0bnwqae4_7-5-rgb_front so we need a guitar
-bz0bnwqae4_8-5-rgb_front i am using a couple of cables one to go from my guitar to my tuner and one to go from my tuner to my amp so we need two cables if you are using a tuner one if you are not and electric tuner and an amplifier
-bz0bnwqae4_9-5-rgb_front and i like to use picks so we are lesson today involves guitar picks and there is all kinds of different guitar picks
-capvlp0bvy_1-8-rgb_front if you are grilling and some of your meat juices or in our case brochette oil drips on your grill and you have got a little fire starting it is always wise to keep a spray bottle of clean water
-capvlp0bvy_2-8-rgb_front you just give it a couple of sprays and make sure it is nice and clean
-capvlp0bvy_3-8-rgb_front and in addition to that always always have nearby your trusty fire extinguisher
-capvlp0bvy_4-8-rgb_front and know how to use it
-capvlp0bvy_5-8-rgb_front gorgeous
-capvlp0bvy_6-8-rgb_front ready to go
-cbj6fwzl08_0-8-rgb_front in this segment we are going to cover the overhead serve and this is very similar to a tennis serve or an overhead smash
-cbj6fwzl08_1-8-rgb_front so the key here is you have your racquet in an already ready position like this and you just toss it up and you smash it
-cbj6fwzl08_2-8-rgb_front so it is a pretty good serve the good news about it is that you are able to really drill the ball at your opponent and a lot of people if you hit the ball at an angle about their shoulder height with a lot of pace they have a hard time with it
-cbj6fwzl08_3-8-rgb_front the thing to be careful about with an overhead serve though is if you hit it too hard you are not able to get positioned for the next shot
-cbj6fwzl08_4-8-rgb_front so just to demonstrate again if you want to just hit it like that you are going to swing and hit it so we are going to show another angle of this serve so you can just kind of get a feel for the mechanics
-cbj6fwzl08_5-8-rgb_front so as you can see i am at an open angle with the ball and i just toss the ball and smash it so in the next segment we are going to cover what it looks like from the front and maybe a little bit from the side
-ci0wtbvlai_0-8-rgb_front to groom your parrot remember that it needs to be bathed
-ci0wtbvlai_1-8-rgb_front parrots need to be bathed in the way that they enjoy being bathed more than the way you want to do it
-ci0wtbvlai_10-8-rgb_front their toenails need to be clipped
-ci0wtbvlai_11-8-rgb_front if they are not and you handle your bird you will be sorry
-ci0wtbvlai_12-8-rgb_front because they can puncture your skin very easily with their toenails
-ci0wtbvlai_13-8-rgb_front this little fellow right here had toenails so sharp as a tiny baby that i almost dreaded to take him out and hand feed him
-ci0wtbvlai_14-8-rgb_front but his toenails now are long enough he can grip and watch that you do not when you are clipping their toenails that you do not go into the quick because you can make them bleed it also hurts the bird and then they get where they do not like you to to handle them
-ci0wtbvlai_15-8-rgb_front a lot of people use clippers i like to use a dremel because a dremel will grind them down and you have got control of how short you actually go to grind down the toenails
-ci0wtbvlai_2-8-rgb_front some parrots love to get in the sink with running water
-ci0wtbvlai_3-8-rgb_front other parrots want to get in the shower with you
-ci0wtbvlai_4-8-rgb_front and some just like to be misted or sprayed with a misting bottle
-ci0wtbvlai_5-8-rgb_front the water should be warm not cold not hot
-ci0wtbvlai_6_7-8-rgb_front and then they will preen their feathers to put them in the shape that they need to be in but also you need to pay attention to their beak
-ci0wtbvlai_8-8-rgb_front their beaks sometimes get soiled and scaly and these bathes do not necessarily clean them up
-ci0wtbvlai_9-8-rgb_front i like to every now and then take just regular vegetable oil on a paper towel and wipe their beaks
-cm5y50t9yg_0-8-rgb_front so here we are and it is race day
-cm5y50t9yg_1-8-rgb_front this is the first day of your big race

-cm5y50t9yg_11-8-rgb_front so it is good to start out head of the game and hopefully if you fuel properly you will end your race hydrated and excited from your big win
-cm5y50t9yg_2-8-rgb_front you have waited for this you have trained and now you are here
-cm5y50t9yg_3-8-rgb_front what do you do when that alarm goes off
-cm5y50t9yg_4-8-rgb_front the first thing you need to think about before you go into any race is your nutrition
-cm5y50t9yg_5-8-rgb_front it is very very important to eat and drink before your race
-cm5y50t9yg_6-8-rgb_front not minutes before your race but typically to hours before your race you want to have something that has some substance some complex carbs
-cm5y50t9yg_7-8-rgb_front the best oatmeal bananas any kind of hot cereal things that are going to stay in and give you the energy you need for the long race
-cm5y50t9yg_8-8-rgb_front the other important thing on race day is hydration
-cm5y50t9yg_9-8-rgb_front do not go into your race dehydrated

-cycszkxfls_1-8-rgb_front there are many different types of biting and stinging insects
-cycszkxfls_2-8-rgb_front that can cause you some pretty serious pain or disease if it should be that serious
-cycszkxfls_3-8-rgb_front so there are many things that you can do to protect yourself against insects

-cycszkxfls_5-8-rgb_front there are clothing or insect mesh clothing that you can purchase pants jackets
-cycszkxfls_6-8-rgb_front but the most important thing the most important defense is going to be your topical skin application and your clothing treatment
-cycszkxfls_7-8-rgb_front and so those are some of the things we are going to be talking about today
-czlazgutsk_0-8-rgb_front now i will tell you a little bit about our distribution of our product how we get it to market
-czlazgutsk_1-8-rgb_front so what we decided to do is take our product directly with our own trucks and get them to different parts of the state

-cmdmw3pkv8_0-8-rgb_front alright folks next we are going to talk about footwear and shoes you can have to complete your vintage look
-cmdmw3pkv8_1-8-rgb_front now the downside i think to looking for vintage footwear is in my case maybe not in all cases is they tend to be a lot of small sizes kind of narrow and a lot of them are hard to find in really good condition
-cmdmw3pkv8_10-8-rgb_front just amazing
-cmdmw3pkv8_11-8-rgb_front unfortunately as cute as these are you are going to find a lot of the missing rhinestones on there and for this one the insole is got torn out
-cmdmw3pkv8_12-8-rgb_front it is just really cute but what i need to do is go to my craft store pick up some rhinestones and just kind of fix them back in there
-cmdmw3pkv8_13-8-rgb_front the vintage shoes sometimes they just need a little more help
-cmdmw3pkv8_14-8-rgb_front especially the fancier ones like this
-cmdmw3pkv8_15-8-rgb_front so these one is have some potential but i might want to bring into a shoe store to get some insoles in here and then maybe have them or myself just maybe hot glue back in some or super glue back in some little rhinestones in there
-cmdmw3pkv8_16-8-rgb_front but what you can do is an alternative to finding some cute vintage themed shoes is you are going to want to try to find some modern day shoes with a vintage look and there is a lot of them out there
-cmdmw3pkv8_17-8-rgb_front now ebay has been a great source for me to find some modern shoes that are priced really affordable but that maintain the integrity of a vintage shoe
-cmdmw3pkv8_18-8-rgb_front here is one pair that i found
-cmdmw3pkv8_19-8-rgb_front they look great
-cmdmw3pkv8_2-8-rgb_front i think just because shoes tend to get a lot of wear and tear as opposed to a vintage dress that someone might wear a handful of times
-cmdmw3pkv8_20-8-rgb_front they look vintage
-cmdmw3pkv8_21-8-rgb_front just these ones are modern and it is great because you are going to find your size
-cmdmw3pkv8_22-8-rgb_front they are brand new and you know they just look really cute
-cmdmw3pkv8_23-8-rgb_front they look like they could be a vintage with some great detailing on them
-cmdmw3pkv8_24_25_26_27-8-rgb_front and here is another pair they do not look quite as vintage they have a vintage flair to them but just look for bows look for prints like the and what not looks for the nice heels like that
-cmdmw3pkv8_28-8-rgb_front these are going to last you longer
-cmdmw3pkv8_29-8-rgb_front they are going to be a little more affordable and they are going to be a lot more comfortable to create that vintage outfit for you and tie it all together
-cmdmw3pkv8_3-8-rgb_front the shoes again get a little wear and tear
-cmdmw3pkv8_30-8-rgb_front now you might be lucky out there and find some vintage shoes that are in great condition
-cmdmw3pkv8_31-8-rgb_front so you know when you go to the stores do not neglect the shoe section
-cmdmw3pkv8_32-8-rgb_front go and take a peek
-cmdmw3pkv8_33-8-rgb_front you might find something
-cmdmw3pkv8_34-8-rgb_front but you are best bet i think sometimes might be to just look online or just look in your shops for some vintage replica shoes and that there is some great tips on finding some vintage footwear to help round out and complete your vintage look
-cmdmw3pkv8_4-8-rgb_front but you are still going to be able to find some cute ones out there
-cmdmw3pkv8_5-8-rgb_front now one type of vintage shoe that i absolutely love and a lot of vintage know hower is out there know they are really fun
-cmdmw3pkv8_6-8-rgb_front they look junky from a distance but they are pretty darn cute
-cmdmw3pkv8_7-8-rgb_front these ones here just like some little plastic patent ones
-cmdmw3pkv8_8-8-rgb_front but when you look closely these just have amazing detail
-cmdmw3pkv8_9-8-rgb_front these ones have a loose heel on them and you can see the detailing that they have on them just rhinestones are lined down the back of these

-dq1scnd-m8_0-8-rgb_front so for these handles that i am using on this chicken baker i have done them with an extruder
-dq1scnd-m8_1-8-rgb_front that is why they look so even and they have a nice textural design to them
-dq1scnd-m8_2-8-rgb_front an extruder is a lot like a giant play dough factory it just squeezes out one very long consistent piece of clay and i like to use that a lot for many of my different handles
-dq1scnd-m8_3-8-rgb_front so the first thing i need to do is prepare the clay for the extruder
-dq1scnd-m8_4-8-rgb_front now my extruder has a inch cylindrical barrel so i need to get a piece of clay that is going to fit in there nicely
-dq1scnd-m8_5-8-rgb_front so i am going to cut a piece off
-dq1scnd-m8_6-8-rgb_front and then i am going to pound it on the table to round out the corners
-dq1scnd-m8_7-8-rgb_front and then i am going to pat to elongate it and thin it out just a little bit more
-dq1scnd-m8_8-8-rgb_front now i want it to be smaller than the actual size of the barrel of the extruder itself so that it will slip in there really easily and it will not get jammed or anything like that
-dq1scnd-m8_9-8-rgb_front so now the clay is prepared and i will show you over at the extruder how this works
-dv52j2dgwq_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is lauren and today i am here to discuss how to brush your hair
-dv52j2dgwq_1-8-rgb_front brushing your hair has a few different advantages
-dv52j2dgwq_2-8-rgb_front number one it can help you to create the style that you would like and the style that you are looking to achieve
-dv52j2dgwq_3-8-rgb_front it also increases the blood circulation to your brain which nourishes your papilla
-dv52j2dgwq_4-8-rgb_front once the blood circulation actually increases towards your brain and towards your scalp your nutrients your papilla which is where the base of your hair follicle is going to grab nutrients out of your bloodstream and help nourish your hair so it is a very good thing to be in the habit of brushing your hair on a regular basis
-dv52j2dgwq_5-8-rgb_front the easiest way to brush your hair especially if your hair is rather knotted is to start at the bottom of the end of the shaft and work your way up
-dv52j2dgwq_6-8-rgb_front if you use a boar is head bristle then it will also help promote smoothness in your hair and it will help maintain frizz
-dv52j2dgwq_7-8-rgb_front plastic bristles will also help get all of those knots out because it has a bit of a better grab to it
-dv52j2dgwq_8-8-rgb_front so again you are going to start at the end of your hair shaft and you are going to work your way up towards your root
-dv52j2dgwq_9-8-rgb_front once you get towards your root you can then do a few really good brush strokes in order to increase that circulation and have more blood flow go up to your scalp and that is how to brush your hair
-db1njjfmvi_0_1-8-rgb_front in this next clip we are going to be going over a hook kick ok a hook is a very powerful kick
-db1njjfmvi_19_20_21_22-8-rgb_front we are going to take a step skip hook it one more time from here step skip hiya ok now when i am kicking i am kicking with the very bottom part of my foot
-db1njjfmvi_2-8-rgb_front we are going to be doing it with pointing our toes and it is going to come across
-db1njjfmvi_23_24-8-rgb_front the whole foot is going to be pointed straight and i am going to hook that all the way across ok that is our kicking position
-db1njjfmvi_25-8-rgb_front so again from here
-db1njjfmvi_27-8-rgb_front and that is going to be your skip hook kick
-db1njjfmvi_3-8-rgb_front it is the opposite of a round kick
-e1qub_rcys_0-8-rgb_front o k i am bobby larew
-e1qub_rcys_1-8-rgb_front one of the drills you can do to work on your front entries is just called a line up
-e1qub_rcys_10-8-rgb_front i should go in vertical and i should be working on my pike save at the end
-e1qub_rcys_11-8-rgb_front so i am going to go walk up to the meter and do a front line up
-e1qub_rcys_2-8-rgb_front a line up i am going to do on the meter board o k
-e1qub_rcys_3-8-rgb_front i do that because it gives me enough height and i do not have to worry about doing a good hurdle to practice a line up
-e1qub_rcys_4-8-rgb_front you can solely concentrate on the line up
-e1qub_rcys_5-8-rgb_front a good line up i am going to go to the end of the board feet together i am going to bend at the waste and extend my arms
-e1qub_rcys_6-8-rgb_front what i am concentrating on is making sure i get my hands closed above my head make sure my elbows are locked my biceps are squeezing my head and my ears
-e1qub_rcys_7-8-rgb_front make sure i have no arch like i am sucking my back this way make sure i got my hips under me a little bit
-e1qub_rcys_8-8-rgb_front i want to have nice tight legs thighs spread apart leave it together nice tight toe frame
-e1qub_rcys_9-8-rgb_front i should not get a lot of splash
-eaxgehv9u4_1-8-rgb_front we actually used the sewing machine for this and basically we had two pieces of fabric
-eaxgehv9u4_10-8-rgb_front i am just going to get my little cloth and just dampen it up a little bit
-eaxgehv9u4_11-8-rgb_front and then we are going to put that on there
-eaxgehv9u4_12-8-rgb_front again make sure none of the fusing is actually sticking out because if it gets on your iron board it is really sticky and it gets on your iron and it is impossible to get out
-eaxgehv9u4_13-8-rgb_front like that put that down see how it steams and it is sealing it shut for us right now
-eaxgehv9u4_14-8-rgb_front slide it around a little bit
-eaxgehv9u4_15-8-rgb_front there you have it a very adorable pumpkin placemat that is going to last for years
-eaxgehv9u4_16-8-rgb_front we made sure of that when we used the zigzag stitched the edges
-eaxgehv9u4_17-8-rgb_front you can throw it in the washing machine and it is going to hold it beautifully
-eaxgehv9u4_18-8-rgb_front stick around i am going to show you a few tricks for embellishing before we go
-eaxgehv9u4_2-8-rgb_front we used the zigzag stitch around and turn it right side out and we actually have a little spot that we are going to but i had an epiphany as i was ironing because you are going to want to just iron your placemat so all of your edges are nice and flat
-eaxgehv9u4_3-8-rgb_front go around and we are not going to actually we are going to use our fusible tape to finish this placemat
-eaxgehv9u4_4-8-rgb_front so i am just going to measure it is a very very little area very small area that i need to finish here
-eaxgehv9u4_5-8-rgb_front so you just measure and cut and again be sure you measure the exact length because if you go over and it ends up sticking out and the iron gets on it it is going to get really hot and it is going to make the outside of your fabric really sticky and that is going to start to bunch up and you do not want that
-eaxgehv9u4_6-8-rgb_front so really kind of take your time in measuring how much tape you re going to use
-eaxgehv9u4_7-8-rgb_front just fold your fabric under on both sides like that you just tuck it in use your finger to do the corner
-eaxgehv9u4_8-8-rgb_front lay that down but make sure your tape does go all the way to the corner otherwise you are going to have a little open corner and you do not want that either
-eaxgehv9u4_9-8-rgb_front go ahead and lay it flat and i am just going to get my iron is hot but not too height though
-eduksqns3u_0-3-rgb_front the game of baroness solitaire is an adding game at its heart and the number you are trying to get to the sum is that right when you add is thirteen
-eduksqns3u_1-3-rgb_front so ace plus queen the ace is one the queen is twelve that equals thirteen
-eduksqns3u_10-3-rgb_front what will i do now
-eduksqns3u_11-3-rgb_front next segment
-eduksqns3u_2-3-rgb_front the king is thirteen by himself
-eduksqns3u_3-3-rgb_front so aces are worth one twos are worth two three is three face value until you get up to ten then jacks are worth eleven queens twelve kings are thirteen so the king does not have to be added to anything
-eduksqns3u_4-3-rgb_front so how does that work in a real example
-eduksqns3u_5-3-rgb_front well the cards i have dealt at the start of this hand of baroness are an ace a two a ten a ten and a three
-eduksqns3u_6-3-rgb_front so if i want combinations that add up to thirteen at this point all i have are a three plus one of the tens
-eduksqns3u_7-3-rgb_front so i am going to take down this three and this ten
-eduksqns3u_8-3-rgb_front that adds up to thirteen
-eduksqns3u_9-3-rgb_front there are no more moves
-egupiyxf3k_0-8-rgb_front now how do we practice for tribal belly dancing
-egupiyxf3k_1-8-rgb_front hi i am johanna krynytzky with hip expressions belly dance studio
-egupiyxf3k_10-8-rgb_front your belly buttons pulled in
-egupiyxf3k_11-8-rgb_front your chest is lifted
-egupiyxf3k_12-8-rgb_front your shoulders are back and down
-egupiyxf3k_13-8-rgb_front arms out away from the body
-egupiyxf3k_14-8-rgb_front and now again the arm position is going to vary
-egupiyxf3k_15-8-rgb_front if you are doing more tribal fusion or if you are doing more improvisational tribal style
-egupiyxf3k_16-8-rgb_front so it depends on where your arms are supposed to go but ultimately you want your isolations to remain nice and precise
-egupiyxf3k_17-8-rgb_front so that you get nice clean movements out of your dancing
-egupiyxf3k_18-8-rgb_front i am johanna krynytzky from hip expressions belly dance studio helping you to practice your tribal belly dance
-egupiyxf3k_2-8-rgb_front now let is talk about practice sessions for tribal belly dance
-egupiyxf3k_3-8-rgb_front now there is different types of tribal style belly dancing
-egupiyxf3k_4-8-rgb_front alright you have improvisational tribal style which developed out of san francisco in the and that is where you dance with a group working on cues and improvisations
-egupiyxf3k_5-8-rgb_front in that case what you needed to do to practice is to practice with your group
-egupiyxf3k_6-8-rgb_front there are certain moves that you need to practice over and over and over again until you have them precisely correct
-egupiyxf3k_7-8-rgb_front now there is also tribal fusion styles of belly dance which developed a little bit later and there is many many different movements for that
-egupiyxf3k_8-8-rgb_front so depending on what you are practicing everything comes back to having your basic isolations
-egupiyxf3k_9-8-rgb_front so you want to practice in front of a mirror with your partners or if you are doing solo by yourself making sure your feet are together under your hips your knees are bent
-ejg3lccwei_4-8-rgb_front this is a lead weight welded to an alligator clip
-ejg3lccwei_5-8-rgb_front we want to hook that to the snell on the hook and drop it down the hole laying out our line until such time that we get slack
-ejg3lccwei_6_7_8-8-rgb_front when we have slack we know we are on the bottom there is our slack we want to mark that and pull it up
-ejg3lccwei_9-8-rgb_front then we know exactly how much line to reel in so that we know that our bait is just off of the bottom
-esvrbrtmu4_0-8-rgb_front ben graham this is probably the second most important thing especially when you are playing the field in the game of baseball
-esvrbrtmu4_1-8-rgb_front this is a glove
-esvrbrtmu4_10-8-rgb_front it is also very difficult to catch in the heel because sometimes the ball will pop out
-esvrbrtmu4_11-8-rgb_front also some gloves have a opener right here
-esvrbrtmu4_12-8-rgb_front it does not really affect the game at all
-esvrbrtmu4_13-8-rgb_front some people feel just more comfortable and like to have more control over how they catch the ball if their finger is on the outside
-esvrbrtmu4_14-8-rgb_front now if we were to take an infielder is glove you would take a couple of inches off of the end of this glove right here
-esvrbrtmu4_15-8-rgb_front an infielder is glove is much smaller
-esvrbrtmu4_16-8-rgb_front it is because they are used to field the ball on the ground so you want less size
-esvrbrtmu4_17-8-rgb_front in the outfield you need a bigger pocket a little bit thicker
-esvrbrtmu4_18-8-rgb_front now the first baseman is glove is the exact opposite
-esvrbrtmu4_19-8-rgb_front it is larger than your standard outfielder is glove
-esvrbrtmu4_2-8-rgb_front this right here is your standard outfielder is glove
-esvrbrtmu4_20-8-rgb_front it has a larger pocket so that the first baseman can stretch and pull the ball in more easily
-esvrbrtmu4_21-8-rgb_front the catcher is mitt is smaller but thicker with more padding which allows protects the catcher is hand as the pitcher is throwing
-esvrbrtmu4_22-8-rgb_front in the major league level pitchers are throwing in the mid to upper with regularity so you want a thick pad for your catcher is mitt
-esvrbrtmu4_23-8-rgb_front but any glove will do for any position some are just better suited than others
-esvrbrtmu4_24-8-rgb_front and that is all about the glove
-esvrbrtmu4_3-8-rgb_front gloves do come in various sizes and various forms depending on the position that you are going to play
-esvrbrtmu4_4-8-rgb_front gloves are made up of just a very few basic things
-esvrbrtmu4_5-8-rgb_front it is usually made out of leather or synthetic leather woven together with leather threads
-esvrbrtmu4_6-8-rgb_front this is the pocket right here
-esvrbrtmu4_7-8-rgb_front this is where you ideally want to catch the ball
-esvrbrtmu4_8-8-rgb_front you will hear you work your glove you want to create a deep nice pocket and cushion
-esvrbrtmu4_9-8-rgb_front if you catch the ball in the pocket it is not going to sting your hand and trust me if you catch it here in the heel it does hurt
-f6vn4bobws_0-8-rgb_front hello have you ever wondered how to heal a broken heart after a breakup
-f6vn4bobws_1-8-rgb_front this is no easy task
-f6vn4bobws_10-8-rgb_front so that some of those raw wounds will heal in time
-f6vn4bobws_11-8-rgb_front remember everyone does survive breakups and usually by the time you are in your is and is you have already had your share of high school breakups

-f6vn4bobws_15-8-rgb_front good luck
-f6vn4bobws_16-8-rgb_front dr felicia here goodbye
-f6vn4bobws_2-8-rgb_front but i am dr felicia and i am here to give you a few tips on how to do that
-f6vn4bobws_3-8-rgb_front for one thing you want to indulge yourself in things that you like and surround yourself by supportive family and friends who understand the situation
-f6vn4bobws_4-8-rgb_front the other thing you want to do is try to embellish some of the good parts of that relationship and try to make some senses to why it actually broke up
-f6vn4bobws_5-8-rgb_front it is really hard to be honest and look inside ourselves and say okay what did i do to contribute to this breakup if anything maybe nothing but it is good for you to take a look at that and analyze it
-f6vn4bobws_6-8-rgb_front the other thing you want to do is also your response may differ whether you are what we call an internal directed person perhaps you think about it a lot you are going to you are going to internalize it you are not going to speak to your friends you are just kind of go and go quiet walks on the beach process that information by yourself
-f6vn4bobws_7-8-rgb_front or you maybe what we call externally driven where you need to throw yourself in a lot of activities and laughter and jokes
-f6vn4bobws_8-8-rgb_front i would strongly recommend laughter is the best medicine
-f6vn4bobws_9-8-rgb_front if you can get through the breakup and eventually time does heal wounds
-f8wnvnnqns_0-8-rgb_front so now that we have got that on there we want to make sure and press it all the way around the edge to make sure that it is nice and secure before we start throwing
-f8wnvnnqns_1-8-rgb_front so just slowly spin your wheel and press down to broaden that base and give it a lot of pressure to hold it on to the top of the pot
-f8wnvnnqns_2-8-rgb_front now once it is attached nice and firmly we want to moisten it but only a very little amount
-f8wnvnnqns_3-8-rgb_front you do not want water running down the sides and pooling in this connection area or your lid might get stuck to your base
-f8wnvnnqns_4-8-rgb_front so you need to be very conservative with your water use here
-f8wnvnnqns_5-8-rgb_front now i am doing i am centering but i am doing a very miniature version of it
-f8wnvnnqns_6-8-rgb_front my left fingers are still the stabilizers and my right fingers are still doing all the work pushing the clay towards the center of the wheel and once you have got that nicely centered and just a column you can just take your right middle finger and push in to make a stem and once you have got a stem you can just pinch the top a little bit to pull it out to make a knob
-f8wnvnnqns_7-8-rgb_front and let that dry slowly so that the connection can become very secure and it does not crack off when it dries
-fc7u7u8awo_0-8-rgb_front this series is going to involve seated poses
-fc7u7u8awo_1-8-rgb_front we are going to utilize straps blocks different variations of your seated poses
-fc7u7u8awo_2-8-rgb_front one of the things that is very common when you are getting started with your yoga practice is it is not very comfortable to sit on the floor
-fc7u7u8awo_3-8-rgb_front so what you are going to want to do is be sure that you have some blocks pillows some things that you will be able to do so that when you are sitting your hips will be higher than your knees
-fc7u7u8awo_4-8-rgb_front so you can use some blocks to sit with but it is going to be important to find out where you can sit and be comfortable with your hips
-fc7u7u8awo_5-8-rgb_front having your knees up this high that is a clue that it is not going to be comfortable with your hips so you will be able to use some blocks under your knees
-fc7u7u8awo_6-8-rgb_front and we will go over all those modifications specifically when we do the poses
-fc7u7u8awo_7-8-rgb_front but as with all the other poses we are going to begin to think about utilizing your breath so that we can deepen your pose relax the muscles

-fe9cqo9pmu_3-8-rgb_front it works well for businesses meetings organizations anytime where people have to kind of create things together
-fe9cqo9pmu_4-8-rgb_front and how it works is you are going to get with your team you can break up into groups of three of four or five i think is a good size it could go up to eight or ten
-fe9cqo9pmu_5-8-rgb_front and what you are going to do is is the team is going to have to come up with a new product and they are going to have to come up with an entire marketing plan for that product
-fe9cqo9pmu_6-8-rgb_front come up with the packaging the commercials the jingle the spokesperson the billboards you know anything you can think of that would be part of the line of marketing
-fe9cqo9pmu_7-8-rgb_front what stores it might be in what the slogan is going to be and anything you can think of
-fe9cqo9pmu_8-8-rgb_front and they are going to have to do that as a group and they have to do it in three minutes
-fe9cqo9pmu_9-8-rgb_front and usually people at that point groan and go what are you talking about that is impossible
-fmygr0ga_e_0-8-rgb_front if you are going backpacking for a little bit longer then you are going to need to resupply unless you are going to carry all the food for your trip
-fmygr0ga_e_1-8-rgb_front if you are going to a particularly remote area then you might have to do that pack every single food into your pack
-fmygr0ga_e_10-8-rgb_front so mailing yourself stuff is one way to resupply
-fmygr0ga_e_11-8-rgb_front going in to a trail town is another way
-fmygr0ga_e_12-8-rgb_front downside to that is you are going to have to take what is local so if you have specific dietary needs then you may want to use the mailing option
-fmygr0ga_e_13-8-rgb_front if you have any questions give your local outfitter a howler
-fmygr0ga_e_2-8-rgb_front what that means is you are going to have to have a pack that can carry heavier loads but if you are able to go into town say go to the grocery store and buy more food then you can carry less food and just resupply as you go along
-fmygr0ga_e_3-8-rgb_front the appalachian trail is a trail that you can do that
-fmygr0ga_e_4-8-rgb_front hike for a little bit go into town get some more food
-fmygr0ga_e_5-8-rgb_front here is a couple of books put out by the appalachian trail conservancy a planning guide and a companion
-fmygr0ga_e_6-8-rgb_front these two books are nice in helping you plan your hike
-fmygr0ga_e_7-8-rgb_front it talks a little bit about how to set up a post office drop you can actually mail yourself some stuff go to a local trail town is post office and come in and say hi i am so and so i need to pick up a package for a and they will hand it to you
-fmygr0ga_e_8-8-rgb_front there is a technique called bump boxes where you if you know what s in that box and you do not need it you can actually bump it to the next trail town and then you do not have to pay extra postage as long as you do not open the box you just say i want to bump this to the next place and give them the address
-fmygr0ga_e_9-8-rgb_front these books will list the addresses for all the post offices all along this particular trail
-_3buhnn4pu_0-8-rgb_front hi today we are going to draw on coquille board
-_3buhnn4pu_1-8-rgb_front on this one it is a little bit more advanced
-_3buhnn4pu_10-8-rgb_front the black is the most important one
-_3buhnn4pu_11-8-rgb_front i have got a gum eraser or some people call it a kneaded eraser
-_3buhnn4pu_12-8-rgb_front and i have got two rulers
-_3buhnn4pu_13-8-rgb_front i have got a clear measurement ruler and well i guess every ruler is a measurement ruler but you can see the measurements through and then this is just a regular metal ruler with a cork bottom
-_3buhnn4pu_14-8-rgb_front i have got an electric pencil sharpener and i have got an exacto blade to cut the board out when we get to that part
-_3buhnn4pu_15-8-rgb_front drawing table that has a it is basically like a cutting mat on top of the table
-_3buhnn4pu_16-8-rgb_front it is like a mat
-_3buhnn4pu_17-8-rgb_front so those are the supplies we are going to use today and i think you will be pleased with the results
-_3buhnn4pu_2-8-rgb_front i am actually going to do a portrait
-_3buhnn4pu_3-8-rgb_front a face of a woman
-_3buhnn4pu_4-8-rgb_front right now i am just going to go over the supplies you are going to need
-_3buhnn4pu_5-8-rgb_front this is a sheet of coquille board which is spelled
-_3buhnn4pu_6-8-rgb_front it is roughly five to six dollars a sheet but it is definitely worth the price
-_3buhnn4pu_7-8-rgb_front i have got a number two pencil which you can find in any drawer in your house
-_3buhnn4pu_8-8-rgb_front i have got two colored pencils
-_3buhnn4pu_9-8-rgb_front i have got a baby blue and i have got a dark black
-_6fmz29bhu_0-1-rgb_front hi
-_6fmz29bhu_10-1-rgb_front the reason i am having jeff stand here is because i messed this shot up once
-_6fmz29bhu_11-1-rgb_front when i did the cue ball went flying off the table and it broke a mirror
-_6fmz29bhu_12-1-rgb_front i really got in trouble with the management
-_6fmz29bhu_13-1-rgb_front jeff is going to stand there and be ready to catch the ball or absorb it into his abs in case anything were to go wrong
-_6fmz29bhu_14-1-rgb_front now i am going to go to the other side of the table and we are going to have the shot
-_6fmz29bhu_15-1-rgb_front alright so here i am
-_6fmz29bhu_16-1-rgb_front i am ready to do the trick shot now
-_6fmz29bhu_17-1-rgb_front i got the cue ball all set up the ball is still stacked on the and and my buddy jeff is making sure that the cue ball will not break anything important
-_6fmz29bhu_18-1-rgb_front lining it up
-_6fmz29bhu_19-1-rgb_front with all my mite
-_6fmz29bhu_2-1-rgb_front for my final trick shot
-_6fmz29bhu_20-1-rgb_front hit the ball first
-_6fmz29bhu_21-1-rgb_front how did i do it
-_6fmz29bhu_22-1-rgb_front pretty simple
-_6fmz29bhu_23-1-rgb_front you do not hit the ball really hard you do not break a mirror but when you hit the cue ball just make sure it is going to go towards the and half way there give the table a little bump
-_6fmz29bhu_24-1-rgb_front the ball will fall down cue ball hits the ball everyone laughs buys you drinks and the mayor will hand you the key to the city
-_6fmz29bhu_3-1-rgb_front this is probably the most impressive one that i have got
-_6fmz29bhu_4-1-rgb_front what i got here is i have got the one ball and the ball holding up the ball
-_6fmz29bhu_5-1-rgb_front how did i do that
-_6fmz29bhu_6-1-rgb_front take your hand hold the balls against the rail just kind of hammer them down a little bit rest the ball on top of them and let go
-_6fmz29bhu_7-1-rgb_front now the object of this shot is i am going to hit the ball with the cue ball without hitting the or the
-_6fmz29bhu_8-1-rgb_front it takes a lot of strength it takes a lot of agility and for the person standing here it takes a lot of guts
-_6fmz29bhu_9-1-rgb_front alright jeff i want you to come here and stand right where i am standing
-_ephr_gwwc_0-8-rgb_front let is talk about managing your cat is bladder infection
-_ephr_gwwc_1-8-rgb_front a bladder infection is diagnosed at your veterinary clinic
-_ephr_gwwc_2-8-rgb_front once they have seen a urinalysis and can determine if there is an infection present then generally antibiotics are going to be needed to treat them
-_ephr_gwwc_3-8-rgb_front there are a couple of important things to think about when we are dealing with infections in cats especially
-_ephr_gwwc_4-8-rgb_front when we are dealing with males
-a1higuw14m_5-8-rgb_front that is good
-a1higuw14m_6-8-rgb_front on the smaller pieces you can do the whole thing but on a larger piece you might want to do a little section at a time
-a1higuw14m_7-8-rgb_front okay now i think oh always have to keep these going back to its position
-a1higuw14m_8-8-rgb_front good i think all the little joints are fluxed now
-a1higuw14m_9-8-rgb_front so we will move on the next step which is to drop beads of solider onto it
-a9ucz7bo5e_0-8-rgb_front hi i am jay french from jayfrenchstudios com and i am going to teach you how to draw a dragon
-a9ucz7bo5e_1-8-rgb_front well of course from our starting point there are essentially it boils down to three types of dragons
-a9ucz7bo5e_10-8-rgb_front toes are usually done very bird like as opposed to reptilian
-a9ucz7bo5e_11-8-rgb_front although you can go both ways again if you look at the claws on a rafter such as an eagle and you look at the claws on a komodo dragon or other large lizard monitor lizard or even some dinosaur bones you will find the talons very similar
-a9ucz7bo5e_12-8-rgb_front long serpentine neck and i have got this one curving around on itself and of course you are going to want a tail
-a9ucz7bo5e_13-8-rgb_front this is also again good looking monitor lizards for references and dinosaurs dinosaur restructures or bones
-a9ucz7bo5e_14-8-rgb_front and of course the really tricky part the head
-a9ucz7bo5e_15-8-rgb_front and this can be done a lot of ways and however you like
-a9ucz7bo5e_16-8-rgb_front i tend to like the very sleek look to dragons where they have a very pointed muzzle and a little more serpentine
-a9ucz7bo5e_17-8-rgb_front probably again there is a lot of influence on on monitor lizards here komodo dragons and the like
-a9ucz7bo5e_18-8-rgb_front i have and affection for doing pupilless on dragons to make them look more mystical
-a9ucz7bo5e_19-8-rgb_front but if you are wanting something that looks more like a real animal then you might want to do snake like slitted pupils
-a9ucz7bo5e_2-8-rgb_front you have the asian serpentine dragon which are long they have no wings short legs mostly like a snake you have a wyvern style which is much like a bat where the forelegs are the wings
-a9ucz7bo5e_20-8-rgb_front i tend to give two very big horns
-a9ucz7bo5e_21-8-rgb_front but you can do it as a single big horn or no horns at all
-a9ucz7bo5e_22-8-rgb_front some extra wings around the jaw line gives a nice touch
-a9ucz7bo5e_23-8-rgb_front and then a good series of ridges that start maybe at the brow ridge or even at the tip of the nose
-a9ucz7bo5e_24-8-rgb_front go all the way down this guy is twisting his neck so we are going to come back around here with the largest across the back and go all the way down the tail
-a9ucz7bo5e_25-8-rgb_front again look at some dinosaur shots for more ideas on this
-a9ucz7bo5e_26-8-rgb_front and then we have our wings
-a9ucz7bo5e_27-8-rgb_front wings basically follow a bat wing
-a9ucz7bo5e_28-8-rgb_front they have an elbow and then essentially fingers all stem from the same spot
-a9ucz7bo5e_29-8-rgb_front again this is a good way to get it to look more like a real animal that way
-a9ucz7bo5e_3-8-rgb_front but we have our very fun what we are going to do here today is the fore legged mythological where they are all mythological four legged and winged dragon
-a9ucz7bo5e_30-8-rgb_front you can do dragon wings just about anyway you want really but they are depicted lots of different ways
-a9ucz7bo5e_31-8-rgb_front and that is your basic lesson in how to draw a dragon
-a9ucz7bo5e_4-8-rgb_front think of a basic lizard shape your body we can start with the rib cage and sort of a couple of ovals
-a9ucz7bo5e_5-8-rgb_front we have the rib cage and then we have the hind quarter
-a9ucz7bo5e_6-8-rgb_front you always have a long serpentine neck put a lot of curvature in to it for drama
-a9ucz7bo5e_7-8-rgb_front we are going to get some sharp angles again for dramatic effect
-a9ucz7bo5e_8-8-rgb_front you want some photo sources look up some pictures of komodo dragons and other types of lizards they give you some good ideas and how to do some of the body part shapes
-a9ucz7bo5e_9-8-rgb_front such as the any just about any four legged creature has very long front legs long and straight whereas there is a lot more a lot more joints to the back leg
-aep1mfousu_1-8-rgb_front when it comes to running in a competition you may want to wear a wristwatch you can time yourself maybe check your breathing just kind of keep things on a safe level
-aep1mfousu_10-8-rgb_front if you find that your results are pretty good and you are like in a situation then by all means go for the competition
-aep1mfousu_11-8-rgb_front but if you find your results are way negative and not even close to theirs you may want to practice a little bit more before you decide to put yourself in that competition
-aep1mfousu_2-8-rgb_front you got to remember when it comes to competition you will always want to keep going
-aep1mfousu_3-8-rgb_front even if it is a slow jog a fast jog something just keep moving constantly
-aep1mfousu_4-8-rgb_front now when it comes to running in a competition you might find that throughout your run you want to throw in a sprint because when you throw in a sprint you got certain type of mobilizers within your body that are meant for sprinting
-aep1mfousu_5-8-rgb_front it builds up those amino is makes you faster it is better overall
-aep1mfousu_6-8-rgb_front after you throw in a sprint just go to a slow jog to a fast jog go back down but always keep running do not stop
-aep1mfousu_7-8-rgb_front so okay i run for this long this many hours this many minutes you go ahead and time your self put on a wrist watch or get someone to hold a stopwatch for you but go ahead maybe put on some type of distance and say i am going to run this far and run that distance and know how well you do
-aep1mfousu_8-8-rgb_front you can slowly expand on that and if you are trying to do a specific kind of competition go ahead and see what those requirements are for that competition speed is how fast people usually do things and how do they feel afterwards
-aep1mfousu_9-8-rgb_front just kind of what there strategies are and go ahead and compare your results and their results
-af-wabkggs_1-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to make a pattern for our eye mask
-af-wabkggs_10-8-rgb_front always remember when you are making patterns or cutting out patterns to have a separate scissors you can use just for paper
-af-wabkggs_11-8-rgb_front cause you do not want to use the fabric scissors
-af-wabkggs_12-8-rgb_front we will go ahead and see this is a little bit to straight so we are going to go ahead and clean that line up just a little
-af-wabkggs_13-8-rgb_front once you have your paper pattern we are ready to transfer this onto our fabric and cut it out
-af-wabkggs_2-8-rgb_front i already have a eye mask it is just a plain kind of boring one that i bought at a eye mask store
-af-wabkggs_3-8-rgb_front so i am just going to use this as a template but if you do not have a sleeping mask basically you want something that is an oval shape about wide
-af-wabkggs_4-8-rgb_front you want a place cut out for your nose so you basically make a long oval and then we are going to cut out for the nose
-af-wabkggs_5-8-rgb_front so i am just going to bring this to my paper and then i am going to go ahead and trace it
-af-wabkggs_6-8-rgb_front you just go ahead and trace it we are going to lift up the little nose guard part and come back down
-af-wabkggs_7-8-rgb_front this does not has to be exact cause we are going to clean it up when we cut it out
-af-wabkggs_8-8-rgb_front i actually want mine to come down a little further so i am just going to go ahead and free hand it
-af-wabkggs_9-8-rgb_front what you do when you are actually free handing something is you go ahead and just fold it in half and then we will cut it out so the other side is the exact same shape
-aics__ed0m_0-8-rgb_front before you start with your spray tan you want to make sure that your area is completely covered or protected
-aics__ed0m_1-8-rgb_front if you are doing this at home maybe do it in the shower or even outside for that matter in the middle of a large area maybe not definitely not on a carpeted area or anywhere where there is fabric
-aics__ed0m_2-8-rgb_front maybe lay plastic or old towel
-aics__ed0m_3-8-rgb_front here we have everything covered with plastic so it is totally protected and whatever is not covered can be mopped cleaned it comes clean it is just a matter of cleaning
-aics__ed0m_4-8-rgb_front i always wear gloves when i am doing when you are the one doing the spray tan
-aics__ed0m_5-8-rgb_front if you are spraying yourself maybe wear gloves until the last minute
-aics__ed0m_6-8-rgb_front make sure you have kleenex nearby because if there is any drips you want to make sure you get those up immediately
-aics__ed0m_7-8-rgb_front make sure your area is pay close attention to make sure that anything that is absorbent fabrics are your biggest thing that the spray would absorb to
-aics__ed0m_8-8-rgb_front your can sprays that you buy in a store also have the same dha active ingredient but it is not the strength like a prescription strength like what we use here
-aics__ed0m_9-8-rgb_front so it probably will come out of your fabrics a little easier but again make sure you are spraying in an area that is nonporous would be the best way to put that
-anfi7cp8vm_0-3-rgb_front alright now we want to look at the political environment
-anfi7cp8vm_1-3-rgb_front now what we are talking about when we are talking about politics or political environment are they democrat
-anfi7cp8vm_10-3-rgb_front did they grow up in a very strict staunch republican household and so because of that now they are a very very liberal democrat
-anfi7cp8vm_11-3-rgb_front or vice a versa
-anfi7cp8vm_12-3-rgb_front how does their political stance help determine who they are and how you are going to play them
-anfi7cp8vm_2-3-rgb_front are they republican
-anfi7cp8vm_3-3-rgb_front are they you know in what extreme of what party are they
-anfi7cp8vm_4-3-rgb_front are they you know staunch republicans
-anfi7cp8vm_5-3-rgb_front are they very very liberal democrats
-anfi7cp8vm_6-3-rgb_front and or are they anything
-anfi7cp8vm_7-3-rgb_front maybe they have no political party affiliation they are not interested in politics they could care less about politics
-anfi7cp8vm_8-3-rgb_front or maybe politics is their life
-anfi7cp8vm_9-3-rgb_front what role does politics play in their life now in this moment as well as how they were growing up
-azes9_vo6g_0-3-rgb_front we are continuing on the lips right now this is really the lipstick application we had put the lip liner on before
-azes9_vo6g_1-3-rgb_front i like taking the lipstick off of the tube with my spatula that way i do not get the tube dirty or anything and the lipstick last for a long time
-azes9_vo6g_2-3-rgb_front then using my lip brush i am going to completely my brush with the lipstick and make sure that it is like it is smoothly in there there is no little bumps of lipstick on it and once you have it charged up we are going to go in and we are going on to amelia is lips
-azes9_vo6g_3-3-rgb_front we are going to have her open up just a little bit we are going to go in and starting on the bottom
-azes9_vo6g_4-3-rgb_front we are going to come up and right when we get to the arch we are really going to twist the brush in our hand and that is how we can get that nice bow in her lip
-azes9_vo6g_5-3-rgb_front this side twist and connect and do the same thing on the bottom lip and the other one
-azes9_vo6g_6-3-rgb_front you got her lips and then just fill them in
-azes9_vo6g_7-3-rgb_front it is a great lipstick application technique
-avt5mztdu0_1-8-rgb_front so now in the same with the forward in same position we want to move it up just a little bit and where the upper ridges are now are in the kidney meridian area and in this position it actually stimulates the kidney and the kidney meridian
-avt5mztdu0_2-8-rgb_front you can do this with your knees raised to your chest or with your body flat
-avt5mztdu0_3-8-rgb_front this gives you a beneficial massage to the kidney area the kidneys are a really important part of the body and health
-avt5mztdu0_4-8-rgb_front it really relaxes the lower back and makes everything loosen up doing this position with the spine aligner
-ayxzltkpqu_0-8-rgb_front alvin dedeaux now as soon as you decide how you are going to grip the rod whether it is over hand with the thumb on top or with the index finger on top the next thing you want to do is to trap that line and that is very important
-ayxzltkpqu_1-8-rgb_front you control is always very important
-ayxzltkpqu_2-8-rgb_front that is where it starts is with trapping that line
-ayxzltkpqu_3-8-rgb_front if you are using the grip basically just use your index finger and trap that line there or if you are using the index finger on top you can grab it with that next finger
-ayxzltkpqu_4-8-rgb_front some people will actually grab it with two fingers if they are using the grip
-ayxzltkpqu_5-8-rgb_front that is perfectly acceptable whatever is most comfortable for you
-ayxzltkpqu_6-8-rgb_front but it is really important to grab that line to anchor that line to the handle of the rod for a lot of different reasons
-ayxzltkpqu_7-8-rgb_front but you know for stripping line and for casting whatever you are doing it is important to have that line anchored right there
-ayxzltkpqu_8-8-rgb_front no movement between here and here just nice and tight
-b44iehorm4_0-5-rgb_front clancy rose so here is your grinder and you are going to fill up the hopper with the coffee
-b44iehorm4_1-5-rgb_front the beans are going to flow down here get ground in the machine they are going to are going to flow into the dosing chamber
-b44iehorm4_2-5-rgb_front you have a lever here on this side of the dosing chamber to move the coffee out of the dosing chamber and then later into your porter filter
-b44iehorm4_3-5-rgb_front one of the things that you are going to have to do is find the right espresso grind
-b44iehorm4_4-5-rgb_front like on this machine a lot of the times it is going to be marked right here on the grinder and like this one says counterclockwise to make the coffee more fine and clockwise to make the coffee more coarse
-b44iehorm4_5-5-rgb_front what these adjustments do is the finer that you grind the coffee the more resistance it has on the water that is passing through it while it is brewing and the shot of espresso is going to pour slower
-b44iehorm4_6-5-rgb_front when the coffee is ground more coarse the water passes through it a lot easier and the shot is going to pour a lot faster
-b44iehorm4_7-5-rgb_front these are things that are going to affect the taste of your espresso a lot and you are going to want to find the time that your particular coffee taste the best and play around with the grind adjustment
-b44iehorm4_8-5-rgb_front cool
-b4_y6losx0_0-8-rgb_front my name is deanna gutierrez and i am a high school teacher in san jose
-b4_y6losx0_1-8-rgb_front some of the pros of being a high school teacher are your emotional commitment to your students and the incredible rewards that you get when they succeed
-b4_y6losx0_10-8-rgb_front you do have summer vacations and your day technically ends at but what they do not tell you is you will be most likely bringing work back
-b4_y6losx0_11-8-rgb_front grading either in your classroom or at home
-b4_y6losx0_12-8-rgb_front and you will be working on the weekends
-b4_y6losx0_13-8-rgb_front but it will be hopefully a labor of love
-b4_y6losx0_14-8-rgb_front and the last con would be the administrative red tape and dealing with principals and maybe that do not share the same vision you do and just being true to yourself and to your students
-b4_y6losx0_15-8-rgb_front my name is deanna gutierrez and i am a high school teacher in san jose
-b4_y6losx0_2-8-rgb_front also summer vacation
-b4_y6losx0_3-8-rgb_front everybody knows teachers love this and also the opportunity to be your own boss
-b4_y6losx0_4-8-rgb_front in your classroom you rule and that is a great plus
-b4_y6losx0_5-8-rgb_front and you can tailor the curriculum usually to fit your talents and the way that the information will come easiest to your students
-b4_y6losx0_6-8-rgb_front some of the cons of the profession are the salary
-b4_y6losx0_7-8-rgb_front especially if you have a family
-b4_y6losx0_8-8-rgb_front living on a teachers salary can be challenging
-b4_y6losx0_9-8-rgb_front another drawback is the long hours
-b7klepxsas_0-8-rgb_front we have already gone over how a cup should fit how a band should fit and the purpose of your strap
-b7klepxsas_1-8-rgb_front but what we have not gone over is that every company makes their bras differently
-b7klepxsas_10-8-rgb_front a e is an american dd
-b7klepxsas_11-8-rgb_front so in america an e is the same as a uk f and it just keeps going that way so it is always good to ask for help because otherwise you will just make yourself crazy
-b7klepxsas_2-8-rgb_front for example this company is called natori and they make a bra that is wider in the wire and shallow in the cup
-b7klepxsas_3-8-rgb_front so while this bra is a d it is not for a who is fuller this way it is for somebody who is more spread out this way
-b7klepxsas_4-8-rgb_front and also this company makes a very stretchy band so if you find out that well you have been wearing a inch band for years and years and years then you should be wearing a
-b7klepxsas_5-8-rgb_front this is a great bra to start transitioning with because it stretches out a little bit quicker than others do
-b7klepxsas_6-8-rgb_front another example is this company called freya
-b7klepxsas_7-8-rgb_front freya is a uk company and they specialize in bras for women with bigger cup sizes and smaller band sizes
-b7klepxsas_8-8-rgb_front so for example if you know somebody who measures inches around and is really busty on top they might wear a g and they could get that from freya
-b7klepxsas_9-8-rgb_front uk sizing is a little different so when you are in the store and you see numbers ask for help
-bhyenwmd3q_1-8-rgb_front right now we are at a big kick in this country to try to get our kids back into boosters
-bhyenwmd3q_2-8-rgb_front parents have used car seats for so long they are so anxious to get there kids out of boosters seats but there is truly not a kinder gardener out there that does not need a booster seat and probably most of the first graders out there need them
-bhyenwmd3q_3-8-rgb_front the law would be changing very soon to require boosters seats to years old and most booster seats goes to and pounds most of them now go to a pounds
-bhyenwmd3q_4-8-rgb_front so we are going to show you a step test and this is what you do in your vehicle to know when your child should actually not need a booster anymore
-bhyenwmd3q_5-8-rgb_front you can not really go by age or weight guidelines so much anymore because seats are so different from vehicle to vehicle
-bhyenwmd3q_6-8-rgb_front for example this seat is out of a chevy silverado this is the same kind of seat that you would find in a suburban or a yukon as a very long base
-bhyenwmd3q_7-8-rgb_front it would very say a child that fits in a compact car or something geometry or a cooper a mini cooper it may have a very small seat base
-bhyenwmd3q_8-8-rgb_front they would fit fine and they wont fit in here so it is going to very from vehicle to vehicle you got to do this test for the child in the vehicle that you are going to put the child in
-bkhi_vtz1q_0-8-rgb_front the next step before you actually apply the acrylic is to just go back and double check everything you have done
-bkhi_vtz1q_1-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that the nails have been roughed up that you have applied the tips and that they are not hanging off the side
-bkhi_vtz1q_2-8-rgb_front the reason for double checking the tips especially is if they are too wide when you put the acrylic on eventually that acrylics going to lift
-bkhi_vtz1q_3-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that it does not lift
-bkhi_vtz1q_4-8-rgb_front lifting can cause moisture to get in and can cause mold
-bkhi_vtz1q_5-8-rgb_front you just want to make sure that you do not have any cuticle left on the nail again because that could lead to some lifting issues
-bkhi_vtz1q_6-8-rgb_front if you see anything that you need to get off just go back and get it off
-bkhi_vtz1q_7-8-rgb_front you just want to double check before you start so that you do not have any problems later on in the process as you go
-bkhi_vtz1q_8-8-rgb_front once you make sure you have everything correct you can start your acrylic application but it is definitely good to make sure you have put on the bond aid you have put on the primer that you have all of your steps completed and this is how you double check the work you have just done
-blfarx5jxu_0-5-rgb_front mike lopez hi
-blfarx5jxu_10-5-rgb_front it has stars for power and toughness ought to be
-blfarx5jxu_11-5-rgb_front so again this means that something on the card is going to tell you what these equal
-blfarx5jxu_12-5-rgb_front this creature has flying which means they can only be blocked by flying creatures creatures with reach and nightmare is cool power is that its power and toughness are equal to each of the number of swamps you control which means that if you have swamps if you play this with all black mana then you at least have a creature with flying which means your mana production is perfectly equal for this card you could play this card in any multicolored deck and you could still get pretty much even mana production as long as you have enough swamps to put enough power and toughness on them
-blfarx5jxu_13-5-rgb_front also this goes up every time you have a swamp so this has unlimited potential
-blfarx5jxu_14-5-rgb_front it is a very powerful card
-blfarx5jxu_2-5-rgb_front and now i am going to discuss nightmare
-blfarx5jxu_3-5-rgb_front nightmare is a very powerful card out of the black color
-blfarx5jxu_4-5-rgb_front it is a rare from the basic set
-blfarx5jxu_5-5-rgb_front it has always been a rare and it has been around for a long time
-blfarx5jxu_6-5-rgb_front so again we have creature nightmare which means it is a nightmare creature that gets benefits for anything that benefits nightmares
-blfarx5jxu_7-5-rgb_front nightmare cost you and a black which means its converted mana cost is
-blfarx5jxu_8-5-rgb_front this means that you are getting a very big creature or a very cool creature in which case this is both
-blfarx5jxu_9-5-rgb_front so again as you see down here nightmare does not have power and toughness
-bpnlbanvci_0-8-rgb_front alright the next shot you want to learn is your snap shot
-bpnlbanvci_1-8-rgb_front basically it is the difference between a wrist shot and a slap shot
-bpnlbanvci_10-8-rgb_front it is not too difficult but again the same thing the same thing as a wrist shot pretty much just the extra snap
-bpnlbanvci_2-8-rgb_front it is kind of in between there of what you are going to do
-bpnlbanvci_3-8-rgb_front for a snap shot just like the wrist shot you are going to plant yourself put a little bend in your knees
-bpnlbanvci_4-8-rgb_front get your hands on your stick
-bpnlbanvci_5-8-rgb_front you can stick handle
-bpnlbanvci_6-8-rgb_front and then all you are going to do is you are going to pull it back just like the wrist shot but then you are going to pull all of your weight back on to the back foot and then you are going to transfer your weight on to the front foot
-bpnlbanvci_7-8-rgb_front but this time with the stick you are going to actually snap it you are going to snap the stick and follow through
-bpnlbanvci_8-8-rgb_front and sometimes that gives you a little bit harder shot than your wrist shot your typical wrist shot
-bpnlbanvci_9-8-rgb_front and that is pretty much a snap shot
-btetrts5zu_0-8-rgb_front today in this segment of bar tools i am going to discuss the bar spoon
-btetrts5zu_1-8-rgb_front now your bar spoon is a long spoon it is twisted in the center
-btetrts5zu_10-8-rgb_front the other example that i am going to show you is layering your drinks
-btetrts5zu_11-8-rgb_front you are going to want to start with your shot glass obviously and from that point you are going to take your first liqueur this is a butterscotch schnapps
-btetrts5zu_12-8-rgb_front and we are going to pour about halfway up
-btetrts5zu_13-8-rgb_front from that point you are going to take your bar spoon and your next which is going to be bailey is irish creme and you are going to just want to penetrate the surface of whatever your first or base alcohol is and pour the second one directly on top of the spoon like such
-btetrts5zu_14-8-rgb_front and see how it gives you a really nice distinct separated layer there
-btetrts5zu_15-8-rgb_front so those are the uses of your bar spoon
-btetrts5zu_16-8-rgb_front always recommend having this behind the bar and take good care of it
-btetrts5zu_2-8-rgb_front it may or may not have an end like such
-btetrts5zu_3-8-rgb_front this is a flat circular end
-btetrts5zu_4-8-rgb_front there is a lot of uses for this
-btetrts5zu_5-8-rgb_front most common basically stirring your drinks layering shots or martinis and scraping out all that ice at the bottom of the blender
-btetrts5zu_6-8-rgb_front so really quickly first use that i explained was stirring your drinks
-btetrts5zu_7-8-rgb_front when this is filled with ice and all of your contents you are just going to place the spoon in like that to the bottom and just stir it
-btetrts5zu_8-8-rgb_front and what this does it allows you to prevent bruising your drink
-btetrts5zu_9-8-rgb_front it is just a different method of mixing your ingredients as opposed to shaking
-bx5x9wxho4_0-5-rgb_front so this is a modified hand to big toe pose
-bx5x9wxho4_1-5-rgb_front you can use a wall for balance
-bx5x9wxho4_10-5-rgb_front again feel that strength building in through your right leg also stretching the hamstrings of the left leg
-bx5x9wxho4_11-5-rgb_front stability concentration and balance
-bx5x9wxho4_12-5-rgb_front and gently release
-bx5x9wxho4_2-5-rgb_front so beginning in mountain pose feeling the roots of your feet they being extended to the earth
-bx5x9wxho4_3-5-rgb_front align the spine lift the rib cage lift the crown of the head towards the sky
-bx5x9wxho4_4-5-rgb_front now getting balance on your right foot planting all four corners of that foot down into the earth
-bx5x9wxho4_5-5-rgb_front and now lift up the left leg
-bx5x9wxho4_6-5-rgb_front now i am noticing i need to hop a little bit forward to be able to reach this leg
-bx5x9wxho4_7-5-rgb_front so that is fine if you do that as well
-bx5x9wxho4_8-5-rgb_front so holding on to your big toe with your index and your middle foot and your no not your index and middle foot your your fingers
-bx5x9wxho4_9-5-rgb_front and then reach that leg out draw the chest back breathe chin parallel to the earth
-c5ckp2jwhe_0-5-rgb_front this koshinage or hip throw is going to be from a hook strike or yokimunuchi
-c5ckp2jwhe_1-5-rgb_front daniel is going to blast me to the side of the head
-c5ckp2jwhe_10-5-rgb_front now he is already bleeding out there is nowhere for that foot to go i can draw him into my hips
-c5ckp2jwhe_11-5-rgb_front here i have trapped
-c5ckp2jwhe_12-5-rgb_front it is here he is trapped
-c5ckp2jwhe_13-5-rgb_front now we will go ahead and get on the hip
-c5ckp2jwhe_14-5-rgb_front here i am locked up in the hip he is already falling put my hip into it over we go
-c5ckp2jwhe_15-5-rgb_front let is do that one more time
-c5ckp2jwhe_16-5-rgb_front blending with it hooking the hip
-c5ckp2jwhe_17-5-rgb_front that is koshinage the hip throw from a hook strike yokimunuchi
-c5ckp2jwhe_2-5-rgb_front this is a very dynamic kushinage because i have to blend with the oncoming strike and time myself so i can end up on his hip at the same time
-c5ckp2jwhe_3-5-rgb_front so you need to end up in here
-c5ckp2jwhe_4-5-rgb_front what i am going to do is come in and dominate here
-c5ckp2jwhe_5-5-rgb_front he is already spinning in this motion so all i need to do is plant my hip there and draw him over
-c5ckp2jwhe_6-5-rgb_front here here is my hip i am already in position and away we go
-c5ckp2jwhe_7-5-rgb_front there is a couple tricky things about this
-c5ckp2jwhe_8-5-rgb_front is when i do this i do not want to step way out here because i am really out of center
-c5ckp2jwhe_9-5-rgb_front i only want to step here almost stepping on his foot that allows me to get good position
-cszpripb94_0-5-rgb_front hi name is scott and i am the owner of climb on indoor rock climbing gym in wilmington north carolina
-cszpripb94_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to discuss rock climbing techniques
-cszpripb94_10-5-rgb_front so what i am going to do is push up with my legs and try to keep my arms straight
-cszpripb94_11-5-rgb_front sometimes there is nothing to stand on so you might have to do what is called a smear which is actually just using the wall for your feet to walk up
-cszpripb94_12-5-rgb_front other techniques might be stemming out to use another wall for balance for your leg
-cszpripb94_13-5-rgb_front these techniques are all things that can be learned at your local indoor rock climbing gym by a qualified professional
-cszpripb94_14-5-rgb_front rock climbing is dangerous so we do ask that you go get instruction
-cszpripb94_15-5-rgb_front this has been rock climbing technique
-cszpripb94_2-5-rgb_front technique is very important in rock climbing to keep you on the wall and climbing efficiently
-cszpripb94_3-5-rgb_front these are things that you can learn at your local indoor rock climbing gym
-cszpripb94_4-5-rgb_front some of the things that you might learn to begin with would be to keep your arms straight while you climb and not bent
-cszpripb94_5-5-rgb_front the more you keep your arms in to your body the more fatigued your muscles are going to become
-cszpripb94_6-5-rgb_front so when we are climbing we try to keep our arms as straight as we can while we climb
-cszpripb94_7-5-rgb_front the other technique that you might learn is footwork
-cszpripb94_8-5-rgb_front footwork is extremely important in rock climbing
-cszpripb94_9-5-rgb_front you do not want to have to do a hole bunch of pull ups you really want to use your feet to balance
-c_ooostigw_0-5-rgb_front for our meerkats we are going to have to take it in two different steps
-c_ooostigw_1-5-rgb_front first off we need to paint the rockery and we are going to need to let that dry and then we will paint the meerkats on top of it
-c_ooostigw_10-5-rgb_front so again just keep expanding up from the central area and once you get towards the top of the rocks like up in here you may choose to like get a you know a smaller brush to get more of the detail on here
-c_ooostigw_11-5-rgb_front usually the rocks are a little bit bumpy and lumpy so actually unlike most of the rest of the painting i find myself remaining comfortable with a bigger brush even towards a lot of the edges
-c_ooostigw_12-5-rgb_front now you could actually get up here higher where you start getting into the feet in the meerkat details
-c_ooostigw_13-5-rgb_front i may go down a brush to make sure i do not accidentally paint over the feet cause i only want to be make sure i can still see those lines when i do move to paint the meerkats later on
-c_ooostigw_14-5-rgb_front so you are going to continue this throughout and you are going to let it dry and then we are also going to add in some pink highlights which i will demonstrate next
-c_ooostigw_2-5-rgb_front so let is get our paint ready and we are going to start filling in this area
-c_ooostigw_3-5-rgb_front so let is dip our brush in and get a nice big dollop of paint making sure that the paint is not dripping too much from off off the brush or at least you have a good drop cloth down
-c_ooostigw_4-5-rgb_front if you are kind of sick and tired of some of the detail work we have been doing the rocks are very excellent therapy cause we are just going to basically plaster this with a nice matte very very light brown maybe a touch of purple and pink in here with some highlights to basically kind of go back over the edges
-c_ooostigw_5-5-rgb_front i am not even worried too much about the rocks shape at this point because they will be very easy to rediscover underneath the paint
-c_ooostigw_6-5-rgb_front of course you can leave these a little bit thinner if you are worried about making sure the where the lines are
-c_ooostigw_7-5-rgb_front otherwise just go to town and slop it on
-c_ooostigw_8-5-rgb_front make a nice thick coat
-c_ooostigw_9-5-rgb_front we are going to try to definitely avoid having to put on two coats here because you do not have to do a lot of the detail work which can make the paint smear
-cjui5furlq_0-5-rgb_front so from here once you have the feet and the legs aligned same thing as the standing pose you will move the left hip forward and the right hip back pressing into the rear heel
-cjui5furlq_1-5-rgb_front keep the forward knee right over the ankle
-cjui5furlq_2-5-rgb_front notice the support you have the support of the chair but also notice the support as you press into your legs
-cjui5furlq_3-5-rgb_front notice the flexibility this is bringing into your hips and your shoulders as you come up into your version of supported verbadrasana
-cjui5furlq_4-5-rgb_front either temple pose or v for victory pose
-cjui5furlq_5-5-rgb_front shoulders move down and back crown lifts the chin is leveled
-cjui5furlq_6-5-rgb_front all the energy is coming right on up the inhale and you can drop down a little more on the exhale
-cjui5furlq_7-5-rgb_front really rely on the support of the chair here even though you feel your feet and your legs supporting you
-cjui5furlq_8-5-rgb_front let the chair support you particularly if you have knee injuries or hip issues
-cjui5furlq_9-5-rgb_front that is what this is for
-cmg4mzqyje_0_1-5-rgb_front hi i am kim with simply beautiful in austin texas we are going to talk about how to get rid of dark spots on your skin
-cmg4mzqyje_10-5-rgb_front she does not have very much in the way of dark spots but we are going to show it to you anyway
-cmg4mzqyje_11-5-rgb_front so we are just going to take a little bit we are going to put it on a you can use it on your finger easy enough
-cmg4mzqyje_12-5-rgb_front i will do it with my finger or
-cmg4mzqyje_13-5-rgb_front and we are just going to rub it on the dark spot
-cmg4mzqyje_14-5-rgb_front just apply it to the dark spot
-cmg4mzqyje_15-5-rgb_front that is all it takes
-cmg4mzqyje_16-5-rgb_front i want you to know the more often you do this if you do it once a day you will get great results
-cmg4mzqyje_17-5-rgb_front if you do it twice a day you will get better results
-cmg4mzqyje_18-5-rgb_front the most important thing i want you to know is that you must wear sunscreen
-cmg4mzqyje_19-5-rgb_front because if we are going to lighten the dark spots then you got to keep a sunscreen on so they do not come back
-cmg4mzqyje_2-5-rgb_front we are going to focus on your face because this is where the areas that women are most concerned about
-cmg4mzqyje_20-5-rgb_front so it is two prong keep your skin clean well moisturized use a spot treatment clarins has a great one lancome has a great one there is one called ambi that you can get in the drug store and that comes for oily skin or dry skin and get that sunscreen on there
-cmg4mzqyje_21-5-rgb_front at least a because it means you are prone to sun damage
-cmg4mzqyje_3-5-rgb_front dark spots are not really necessarily a result of age it has to do with skin damage from the sun
-cmg4mzqyje_4-5-rgb_front i want you to know there is lots of products out there that can work
-cmg4mzqyje_5-5-rgb_front from very very expensive to great drug store brands it is just a matter of what you are budget level is and what you are comfortable with
-cmg4mzqyje_6-5-rgb_front there is spot treatments
-cmg4mzqyje_7-5-rgb_front there is stuff that you can put all over your whole skin
-cmg4mzqyje_8-5-rgb_front i am going to recommend to you that you just do a spot treatment
-cmg4mzqyje_9-5-rgb_front i am going to demonstrate on megan is skin
-cv1gzagtnk_0-5-rgb_front hello this is jb
-cv1gzagtnk_1-5-rgb_front i am with the austin homebrew supply in austin texas
-cv1gzagtnk_10-5-rgb_front generally in beer making there is two stages that you will take these readings
-cv1gzagtnk_11-5-rgb_front one of which is when you are steeping the grain at the first part of the of the brewing process
-cv1gzagtnk_12-5-rgb_front you need to make sure that you achieve particular temperatures
-cv1gzagtnk_13-5-rgb_front this will help you to make sure that you are not too hot or too cool
-cv1gzagtnk_14-5-rgb_front there is one other stage that you want to use this at
-cv1gzagtnk_15-5-rgb_front it is right before you pitch the yeast in to it
-cv1gzagtnk_16-5-rgb_front you have got to make sure that your beer is not too hot
-cv1gzagtnk_17-5-rgb_front if you put the living yeast in to too hot of an environment it will kill the yeast
-cv1gzagtnk_18-5-rgb_front so thermometer is come in handy for beer making
-cv1gzagtnk_19-5-rgb_front comes in a fahrenheit and centigrade scale
-cv1gzagtnk_2-5-rgb_front today we are discussing beer making equipment and wine making equipment
-cv1gzagtnk_20-5-rgb_front most folks in america talk fahrenheit
-cv1gzagtnk_21-5-rgb_front so this is our floating thermometer our basic one
-cv1gzagtnk_22-5-rgb_front it is about a seven dollar thermometer
-cv1gzagtnk_23-5-rgb_front we also have one that is a very fast reader
-cv1gzagtnk_24-5-rgb_front we call it the lab thermometer
-cv1gzagtnk_25-5-rgb_front it does not float but it reads real quickly so you immerse it in to the liquid and get a reading with in maybe fifteen seconds or so
-cv1gzagtnk_26-5-rgb_front and then the lastly we have our dial type thermometer which has a little clip on the side of it
-cv1gzagtnk_27-5-rgb_front you could put it on the side of a kettle and monitor the temperature inside of the either wort or when you are actually taking your temperature right before you pitch the yeast
-cv1gzagtnk_28-5-rgb_front so a few different types of thermometer is that you can use in brewing
-cv1gzagtnk_3-5-rgb_front we are going to talk about thermometers right now which is more applicable to beer than wine although some people will take use high use a thermometer for wine making
-cv1gzagtnk_4-5-rgb_front it is generally more applicable to beer making
-cv1gzagtnk_5-5-rgb_front but we sell a different a few different varieties of thermometers
-cv1gzagtnk_6-5-rgb_front i will just show you three different varieties here to start out with
-cv1gzagtnk_7-5-rgb_front our standard on is a floating thermometer
-cv1gzagtnk_8-5-rgb_front it is going to come with our deluxe beer equipment kits
-cv1gzagtnk_9-5-rgb_front and these guys simply you just drop them in to whatever liquid you are trying to get the temperature of
-de8t2quw3i_0-5-rgb_front alvin dedeaux so the basic tools you are going to need
-de8t2quw3i_1-5-rgb_front hemostats those are good for mashing down the barbs on your hooks also good for grabbing a hook and getting it out of fish is mouth and these have a nice little feature here that you can actually mash the split shot down with
-de8t2quw3i_10-5-rgb_front another real nice thing to have is a hook sharpener for obvious reasons you want to keep that hook sharp
-de8t2quw3i_11-5-rgb_front this one is cool cause it is made out of a ceramic material so it will not rust and i have had that one for years and it is been in saltwater it is been in fresh water and it still keeps my hooks nice and sharp
-de8t2quw3i_12-5-rgb_front as far as tools go that is your basics
-de8t2quw3i_13-5-rgb_front there is a lot of other stuff you can have pliers pocket knife but if you got clippers and hemostats hook sharpener that should get you by
-de8t2quw3i_2-5-rgb_front they come in all different sizes and shapes bigger ones longer ones some of them are brightly colored some of them are colored anodized like a matte black so they do not reflect light
-de8t2quw3i_3-5-rgb_front there is just different hemostats for different finger sizes you name it
-de8t2quw3i_4-5-rgb_front another really important tool and a kind of a tool is your clippers obviously for clipping the line if you add and tip it or you got a knot and you need to cut your leader to retie it you want to have clippers
-de8t2quw3i_5-5-rgb_front another thing that is important on your clippers is this little needle
-de8t2quw3i_6-5-rgb_front this one actually has a retractable needle
-de8t2quw3i_7-5-rgb_front that is really good like say you have got the eye of your flies all gunked up
-de8t2quw3i_8-5-rgb_front sometimes when they tie them they will have an extra paint or glue covering the eye and you can use that needle to poke out the eye
-de8t2quw3i_9-5-rgb_front also if you get a tangle you can actually use that needle to stick in there and kind of untangle the knot you have in your line
-didfcizvgu_0-5-rgb_front so we have got our three pound ball of clay
-didfcizvgu_1-5-rgb_front you want to slap it really hard down onto the wheel head take your left hand and your left arm put your body weight into it lean it against the wheel head
-didfcizvgu_2-5-rgb_front you want to lean your body weight have it all the way through to the heel of your hand your left hand is not going to move very much your right hand you are going to use to bring the clay towards your left hand
-didfcizvgu_3-5-rgb_front you do want your sponge to be wet not so wet that it is dripping but wet enough that if you squeeze it water will come out and you just give it a little squeeze with your hand any time you need more lubrication
-didfcizvgu_4-5-rgb_front make a fist and push down all the while your left hand is just serving as support
-didfcizvgu_5-5-rgb_front it is not really doing anything but keep the clay on center
-didfcizvgu_6-5-rgb_front you push down into the center a little bit with that fist that you have made and once you have made the well here you want to check the depth with your needle tool
-didfcizvgu_7-5-rgb_front for a berry bowl you probably want that is about an inch and that is probably about right because we are going to have a trimmed foot on there so you need to leave room for that
-didfcizvgu_8-5-rgb_front next we will pull the walls
-dk6mh2v-64_0-5-rgb_front so as we drop into this dragon position a lot of whether your foot is flat on the floor is going to depend on your ankle flexibility
-dk6mh2v-64_1-5-rgb_front many people do not have the flexibility to be able to put their heel flat on the floor in this position
-dk6mh2v-64_2-5-rgb_front so it is perfectly fine to keep that ankle bent up to whatever angle you need to in order to maintain this position
-dk6mh2v-64_3-5-rgb_front the ankle is not necessarily important it is keeping the body sunk down over the leg which is important wherever your ankle manages to be in that position is fine
-dk6mh2v-64_4-5-rgb_front that being said the more you can draw your heel down to the floor and sink forward the more you are going to be gaining flexibility in the ankle and that is going to help your martial arts training especially when we are doing kicks and using darthaflexion and plantar flexion for thrusting forward
-dmiu8bjucm_0-5-rgb_front chopping is another sort of a stroke that we can use on the horse is this one in particular you have to be careful where you are using it
-dmiu8bjucm_1-5-rgb_front it is just what it sounds like it is like a karate chop sort of a thing i guess
-dmiu8bjucm_2-5-rgb_front and you hold your hand this way the fingers closed and you are actually striking the horse with the side of your hand
-dmiu8bjucm_3-5-rgb_front and you can use a fair amount of pressure when you are doing this
-dmiu8bjucm_4-5-rgb_front you really want to be careful and be paying attention to what you are doing
-dmiu8bjucm_5-5-rgb_front watch your horse for signs of reaction watch your horse for flinching and be feeling with your hand while you are doing it
-dmiu8bjucm_6-5-rgb_front watch your horse is doing how what their reaction is to it
-dmiu8bjucm_7-5-rgb_front if they start to duck away from what you are doing and you need to back off perhaps that is an area where you should be using a different sort of a stroke
-dmiu8bjucm_8-5-rgb_front but again you want to keep your fingers closed use the sides of your hand and just use light moderate and heavy pressure
-dmiu8bjucm_9-5-rgb_front and be careful where you are using that sort of a stroke
-dnt6nmrffe_0-5-rgb_front our next stretch is going to be a side stretch
-dnt6nmrffe_1-5-rgb_front let is go ahead and taking the hands by your side and stretching one side at a time we will start with the right side inhaling up with the right arm
-dnt6nmrffe_10-5-rgb_front elbow comes closer to the floor hand reaches closer to the ceiling and to the side
-dnt6nmrffe_11-5-rgb_front and again ideally your hand and your gaze is up at your hand
-dnt6nmrffe_12-5-rgb_front if it hurts your neck you can keep your head center even to the floor
-dnt6nmrffe_13-5-rgb_front deep breath inhale lift
-dnt6nmrffe_14-5-rgb_front exhale stretching a little bit deeper
-dnt6nmrffe_15-5-rgb_front and last breath in
-dnt6nmrffe_16-5-rgb_front exhale slowly when you get back to center
-dnt6nmrffe_17-5-rgb_front just relaxing your hands in your lap you can close your eyes if you like and just feeling the affects of the stretch
-dnt6nmrffe_2-5-rgb_front then you exhale and slowly take it over to the side
-dnt6nmrffe_3-5-rgb_front you like to look up at your hand as you are stretching feeling it stretch and deepening the stretch along your side
-dnt6nmrffe_4-5-rgb_front this bottom hand every exhalation the elbow getting closer to the floor
-dnt6nmrffe_5-5-rgb_front so as you inhale you lift exhale dropping closer to the floor reaching the hand up towards the ceiling farther along to the side of the wall
-dnt6nmrffe_6-5-rgb_front inhale and exhale stretching deeper
-dnt6nmrffe_7-5-rgb_front the next exhale you will slowly bring it back to center and then do the same thing on the other side
-dnt6nmrffe_8-5-rgb_front deep breath inhale left arm comes up and then exhale slowly taking it over
-dnt6nmrffe_9-5-rgb_front inhale and then exhale
-dsv5urtw8m_1-5-rgb_front and today we are going to be doing a method or a technique called a stepping stone
-dsv5urtw8m_10-5-rgb_front they are strong enough to step on like i said but people think they are too pretty to step on
-dsv5urtw8m_11-5-rgb_front so do not worry about it
-dsv5urtw8m_12-5-rgb_front i am going to show you what to do and have fun with it
-dsv5urtw8m_13-5-rgb_front so what we are going to do we actually need a mold
-dsv5urtw8m_14-5-rgb_front these are called molds
-dsv5urtw8m_15-5-rgb_front they come in a variety of sizes and of course they are available at your local stained glass store
-dsv5urtw8m_16-5-rgb_front so anyway they are fairly expensive i think but as far as many stones that you can get them they are actually worth every penny
-dsv5urtw8m_17-5-rgb_front in fact they turn out to be quite cheap at that point
-dsv5urtw8m_18-5-rgb_front so anyway find a size you like or start with a pattern first
-dsv5urtw8m_19-5-rgb_front so check it out on the next step
-dsv5urtw8m_2-5-rgb_front and what we are going to do is we are going to be using art glass stained glass for the surface of the stone and then it is going to be poured with a bunch of grout
-dsv5urtw8m_3-5-rgb_front believe it or not these things are incredibly durable
-dsv5urtw8m_4-5-rgb_front in fact not only durable they are heavy
-dsv5urtw8m_5-5-rgb_front so anyway they are for your flower beds your walkways even keep them in the house
-dsv5urtw8m_6_7_8_9-5-rgb_front they are so pretty they are strong enough to step on they are strong enough for water they are going to make it through the seasons if you do the couple of techniques to make it through the ages
-dtqnmttqo8_0-5-rgb_front first i want to tell you what the purpose is of preparing your platform statement
-dtqnmttqo8_1-5-rgb_front when most young ladies enter a pageant they are required to have a platform
-dtqnmttqo8_2-5-rgb_front and a platform can consist of something that you believe in very strongly it can consist of something say an organization that you have been a part of for a long time
-dtqnmttqo8_3-5-rgb_front but it is a purpose for which you have that you want to represent if you win the title of the pageant
-dtqnmttqo8_4-5-rgb_front and i am going to talk about how to prepare the platform statement that you are going to turn into the judges so that they can read this about you and determine whether or not your platform is strong enough to support your pageant title
-dtqnmttqo8_5-5-rgb_front one of the main reasons that you need a platform is during the course of the pageant at some point you are going to have to get introduce yourself on stage and tell everyone what your platform is
-dtqnmttqo8_6-5-rgb_front so i am going to demonstrate that now
-dtqnmttqo8_7-5-rgb_front good evening
-dtqnmttqo8_8-5-rgb_front i am erica saylors and my platform is prevention of elderly neglect
-dxu26rkb7i_0-5-rgb_front at home if you are doing one or two loaves and you want to use an old fashioned method you just have to knead it by hand
-dxu26rkb7i_1-5-rgb_front knead by hand until you have the window that is a very good question
-dxu26rkb7i_10-5-rgb_front i do not think at home you can really mess it up by over mixing it
-dxu26rkb7i_11-5-rgb_front it is best to watch it and just make sure the ingredients are mixed properly without being over mixed
-dxu26rkb7i_12-5-rgb_front if you over mix it your cookies will run
-dxu26rkb7i_13-5-rgb_front if you over mix your muffin your muffin will run because what happens is you will incorporate so much air in it that the air in there will bubble up and make the cookie and the muffin run
-dxu26rkb7i_2-5-rgb_front now what is a window
-dxu26rkb7i_3-5-rgb_front let me show you what a window is
-dxu26rkb7i_4-5-rgb_front a window is when you pack the dough and you stretch it out and the dough becomes so smooth this is what you call a window
-dxu26rkb7i_5-5-rgb_front where you stretch your dough until it becomes thin and when you hold it up to the light you can see the light come through it without getting torn and without getting tears in it or without getting holes in it that is when your dough is ready
-dxu26rkb7i_6-5-rgb_front so at home when you knead it you have to knead it enough
-dxu26rkb7i_7-5-rgb_front every so often take a piece of it look for your window and if you have your window your dough is ready
-dxu26rkb7i_8-5-rgb_front so that is one way to do it
-dxu26rkb7i_9-5-rgb_front as well as mixing the cookie dough and muffin dough you have to be careful not to over mix anyway
-dyklsoftbu_0-5-rgb_front let is add a hip slide to our choo choo shimmy
-dyklsoftbu_1-5-rgb_front so let is review the hip slide real quickly
-dyklsoftbu_10-5-rgb_front so side and side
-dyklsoftbu_11-5-rgb_front keep your body in the center and let your hips go on either side of you
-dyklsoftbu_12-5-rgb_front watch those ankles that they stay press in toward each other
-dyklsoftbu_13-5-rgb_front where is your belly button
-dyklsoftbu_14-5-rgb_front make sure its touching your spine
-dyklsoftbu_15-5-rgb_front lift your chest breath
-dyklsoftbu_16-5-rgb_front make sure everything is in its right place
-dyklsoftbu_17-5-rgb_front and keep those hips moving nice and evenly
-dyklsoftbu_18-5-rgb_front you can do this best by practicing in the mirror
-dyklsoftbu_2-5-rgb_front feet are slightly apart
-dyklsoftbu_3-5-rgb_front make sure your knees are just soft bring your belly button in lift your chest and these hips are going to slide just outside of your body line
-dyklsoftbu_4-5-rgb_front if you imagine keeping your head right in the center the hips are going to slide on either side of that
-dyklsoftbu_5-5-rgb_front and then we are going to keep pressing them down so that they stay parallel to the floor as much as possible
-dyklsoftbu_6-5-rgb_front good
-dyklsoftbu_7-5-rgb_front now let is get our choo choo shimmy going
-dyklsoftbu_8-5-rgb_front up on relevee pull those hips in toward the rib cage
-dyklsoftbu_9-5-rgb_front now we are going to be shifting our weight during our choo choo shimmy and we are going to be using our hips and side muscles to press the hips side to side
-djrbcxjlyo_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to learn how to make gourmet coffee in your home
-djrbcxjlyo_10-5-rgb_front and there you are
-djrbcxjlyo_11-5-rgb_front it is basically like a hot chocolate except it is going to be irish cream flavored
-djrbcxjlyo_12-5-rgb_front remember though if you are going to make something with fruit flavors to cut it with vanilla or if you have like a thick syrup like chocolate you can cut it with that too
-djrbcxjlyo_13-5-rgb_front it is not going to curdle
-djrbcxjlyo_14-5-rgb_front and that is how you make an irish cream steamer also known as the cream of steamer
-djrbcxjlyo_2-5-rgb_front all right
-djrbcxjlyo_3-5-rgb_front in this clip i am going to explain to you real quickly how to make an irish cream steamer
-djrbcxjlyo_4-5-rgb_front this is basically just going to be the steamed milk and then your flavor
-djrbcxjlyo_5-5-rgb_front it sounds really really fancy but it is not
-djrbcxjlyo_6-5-rgb_front if you have like kids in the house or people who do not like coffee this is a great drink to make because it does not have espresso
-djrbcxjlyo_7-5-rgb_front all right we got our milk steamed
-djrbcxjlyo_8-5-rgb_front what we are going to do we got our sugar for the irish cream
-djrbcxjlyo_9-5-rgb_front one two three pumps
-dyt7rtkamk_0-5-rgb_front sal collura okay now that we have gone through the days of the week i would like to get specific for certain events
-dyt7rtkamk_1-5-rgb_front let is start with road racing
-dyt7rtkamk_10-5-rgb_front okay so hit the hill as hard as you possibly can in the biggest gear you can
-dyt7rtkamk_11-5-rgb_front either you are turning around and coming back downhill or if you can make a loop out of it but you need a few minutes less than of recovery
-dyt7rtkamk_12-5-rgb_front so you get a couple of minutes of just recovery
-dyt7rtkamk_13-5-rgb_front you are not going hard
-dyt7rtkamk_14-5-rgb_front you are panting you are breathing you are getting over what you just did then you are going to do it again
-dyt7rtkamk_15-5-rgb_front and i recommend with hill repeats you are going to hit that thing five six seven times
-dyt7rtkamk_16-5-rgb_front if it is early early spring you are not going to be able to do it as much
-dyt7rtkamk_17-5-rgb_front if you are to the point where you are getting in shape maybe you can hit that thing times and you know what
-dyt7rtkamk_18-5-rgb_front that is your workout for the day
-dyt7rtkamk_19-5-rgb_front it is hard it is going to hurt but you are done
-dyt7rtkamk_2-5-rgb_front so if you are training specifically for road racing i would take that week and add the following things
-dyt7rtkamk_20-5-rgb_front at the end of that times you can just noodle home take an easy ride to recover
-dyt7rtkamk_21-5-rgb_front but it is those really hard efforts and it can be short
-dyt7rtkamk_22-5-rgb_front you know a mile hill is not going to take you very long if you are going full speed but it is that extreme effort that is really training your body
-dyt7rtkamk_23-5-rgb_front you are getting your heart rate up you are opening up those lungs and you are building big muscles in your legs pushing up that hill
-dyt7rtkamk_24-5-rgb_front and the other thing i would add for training for road racing is do a little bit of that base miles training where you are at of your max for an extended period of time and maybe you are doing that on your wednesday
-dyt7rtkamk_25-5-rgb_front let is say you are doing to hours
-dyt7rtkamk_26-5-rgb_front well keep it at a point where you are not really comfortable
-dyt7rtkamk_27-5-rgb_front you are just out of your comfort range but you are doing it for extended periods of time
-dyt7rtkamk_28-5-rgb_front and again not going you will be able to extend that longer and that is good training for you to keep in that training zone for a good hours and maybe that could be your wednesday
-dyt7rtkamk_3-5-rgb_front i think hill repeats are an important aspect of training for road racing
-dyt7rtkamk_4-5-rgb_front one most road races are going to have some kind of hill so you are training yourself to climb hills that is great
-dyt7rtkamk_5-5-rgb_front but the other thing it does it takes you to a deeper level
-dyt7rtkamk_6-5-rgb_front what is going to happen is a road race is there is going to be an attack it is going to be strung out
-dyt7rtkamk_7-5-rgb_front there is going to be a section of time where you are way out of your comfort zone
-dyt7rtkamk_8-5-rgb_front what hill repeats do is simulate that
-dyt7rtkamk_9-5-rgb_front so for example let is say you take is use a long hill
-e28snemno4_0-5-rgb_front when you are designing stuff remember that functionality always comes in to play
-e28snemno4_1-5-rgb_front unless you are designing a couture collection which is going to go run down the runway and nobody is ever going to buy it it is going to be more of a show
-e28snemno4_2_3-5-rgb_front think about functionality and you can have functionality with good design you can have functionality with a little bit of pizazz
-e28snemno4_4-5-rgb_front this was from my collection that was inspired by and i did mostly boy shorts that were comfortable that if you were a superhero you can move in them
-e28snemno4_5-5-rgb_front you can go save the day
-e28snemno4_6-5-rgb_front you can go save dinner for somebody
-e28snemno4_7-5-rgb_front it is real life level blown up and made fantastical but still within keeping with a set frame of reference
-e28snemno4_8-5-rgb_front these again boy shorts with design detail and they have a more straight across menswear inspired waistband but the legs are girlier because they are arched up and then i did my central panel as a design detail and i added a band at the legs and a band at the waist
-e9uexlpa4g_0-5-rgb_front now again you are aware of your posture you realize that your shoulders are rounded and that you need to do something about it i got something very simple for you to do
-e9uexlpa4g_1-5-rgb_front this is a shoulder elevation and depression with arms overhead
-e9uexlpa4g_10-5-rgb_front i guarantee you your shoulders will feel better
-e9uexlpa4g_11-5-rgb_front at first it might be a little sore but they will feel better and they will look better
-e9uexlpa4g_2-5-rgb_front now i have to warn you that if you have a little bit of difficulty with this move please refer to the shoulder elevation and depression either with the hands by the side or the hands in front the arms in front before you temp this if it is a little bit challenging for you
-e9uexlpa4g_3-5-rgb_front but basically what this looks like is once you are sitting on your ball the sit bones you are bringing your arms overhead you are going to shrug your shoulders towards your ears with that inhalation and then as you exhale you are going to press down
-e9uexlpa4g_4-5-rgb_front and if you notice i am not bending my elbows
-e9uexlpa4g_5-5-rgb_front it is not about this it is about the shoulder moves
-e9uexlpa4g_6-5-rgb_front so feel like your shoulder blades is sliding up the back as you inhale and sliding down the back as you exhale
-e9uexlpa4g_7-5-rgb_front and you really going to make sure that you are pressing down with the shoulder blades with the back muscles into your hips or towards your hips rather
-e9uexlpa4g_8-5-rgb_front so inhale exhale
-e9uexlpa4g_9-5-rgb_front again this may not be the easiest thing to do if you are trying it for the first time so refer to the clips with the hands by the side or the hands in front of you so you can get your body used to doing this at first and then once you master those then you will feel free to do this
-eji_yothne_0_2_3-5-rgb_front hi i am john with expertvillage com and we have our light switch plate cover and it is almost finished all we have to do is seal it before we seal it we can do a couple of other things
-eji_yothne_10-5-rgb_front you do not want to do this in the house but we are going to do it in the house anyway because we have an art room for this stuff
-eji_yothne_11-5-rgb_front do it in your garage out on the sidewalk or whatever
-eji_yothne_12-5-rgb_front just get something to put it on because it will over spray and get on your carpet or whatever
-eji_yothne_13-5-rgb_front lay it on there
-eji_yothne_14-5-rgb_front we are just going to do a little bit
-eji_yothne_15-5-rgb_front when you do it start out here work in
-eji_yothne_16-5-rgb_front even strokes
-eji_yothne_17-5-rgb_front even strokes
-eji_yothne_18-5-rgb_front the can is kind of empty
-eji_yothne_19-5-rgb_front that is okay
-eji_yothne_20-5-rgb_front i do not want to blast it with a bunch of glitter because it is going to be in my room but i like it
-eji_yothne_21-5-rgb_front there is a little bit on there right now
-eji_yothne_22-5-rgb_front let is let it dry then we will seal it
-eji_yothne_4_5_6-5-rgb_front we can add some paint and then let it dry and seal it we can add some glitter i am going to add some glitter
-eji_yothne_7_8_9-5-rgb_front it is going to be gold you can just get this at any craft store before you go ahead and spray it shake it up real good
-ekw7celh_e_0-5-rgb_front when using throw bags you really want to use them in the right situations and often people get a little over eager and use them in appropriately
-ekw7celh_e_1-5-rgb_front whenever you are about to deploy the throw bag you want to make sure that the person you are throwing it to knows it is coming
-ekw7celh_e_2-5-rgb_front so letting them know by shouting rope nice and clearly and loudly so they can hear and you make eye contact with them is important
-ekw7celh_e_3-5-rgb_front you always want to make sure you are throwing the bag from an appropriate base as well
-ekw7celh_e_4-5-rgb_front so throwing from a kayak or a canoe where you do not have a lot of stability and you are not securely fastened to the ground is not the best idea
-ekw7celh_e_5-5-rgb_front on larger rivers occasionally it is okay to throw from a rock
-ekw7celh_e_6-5-rgb_front however if you do that that person in the water touches the end of the rope causes a lot of drag so you are going to get pulled towards them
-ekw7celh_e_7-5-rgb_front so you are going to get taken too and also the person you are throwing to
-ekw7celh_e_8-5-rgb_front you do not want to throw to someone who is panicking and thrashing around and you definitely do not want to throw to someone who is unconscious
-ekw7celh_e_9-5-rgb_front just placing a rope in the river is creating a bad situation and once it is in that moving current it is pretty uncontrollable sometimes and it can create a worse hazard than already existed
-el7lquy2fo_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is michelle and i am going to explain to you on how you can care for a tooth after extraction
-el7lquy2fo_1-5-rgb_front it is very important that when you do have a tooth extracted that you really want to avoid that area
-el7lquy2fo_10-5-rgb_front you want to also avoid sucking through a straw which sucking through a straw could in return cause suction which can cause a dry socket
-el7lquy2fo_11-5-rgb_front other than that you really want to follow up with your general dentist after you have an extraction usually one to two weeks afterwards just to make sure that the area is healing correctly and that you are not going to be having any future problems with it
-el7lquy2fo_12-5-rgb_front once again my name is michelle and i just explained to you on how to care for a tooth after extraction
-el7lquy2fo_2-5-rgb_front you want to avoid chewing on that side you want to avoid messing around with it with your tongue especially if you have any stitches in your mouth
-el7lquy2fo_3-5-rgb_front you really want to just take care of the area
-el7lquy2fo_4-5-rgb_front you want to really rinse with warm salt water rinses
-el7lquy2fo_5-5-rgb_front it is a great remedy
-el7lquy2fo_6-5-rgb_front it helps with any inflammation that you might have and it also helps with any soreness that you might have after the extraction
-el7lquy2fo_7-5-rgb_front you really if you are a smoker you really want to avoid smoking for the initial first to hours because if you do what happens when you do smoke is you are creating suction and you can get what we call a dry socket which is very painful
-el7lquy2fo_8-5-rgb_front you do not want to have that
-el7lquy2fo_9-5-rgb_front you also want to avoid as far as like caffeine products or any acid type foods for your gums
-ep-kud9hd8_0-5-rgb_front ok what is taking place is that when you press down the circuit switch you are closing the switch which allows the electrons to run all the way through the wires to create this electro magnetic attraction
-ep-kud9hd8_1-5-rgb_front you have got your nail here and you notice that this is all free standing right here
-ep-kud9hd8_10-5-rgb_front now you can imagine this using the morse code say that you do not have the opportunity to use a computer on the high seas
-ep-kud9hd8_11-5-rgb_front you need to make an sos signal the best thing to do is to have flashlight or something that flashes a light and this is an international code however old it may be and not in a lot of use
-ep-kud9hd8_12-5-rgb_front that could save your life
-ep-kud9hd8_13-5-rgb_front that could get you help
-ep-kud9hd8_14-5-rgb_front and i think in one of tom hanks in the movie or whatever he you have often used light to say oh there is a rescue plane coming on gilligan is island often lighting up a bonfire that says sos on it
-ep-kud9hd8_15-5-rgb_front this was the international symbol and definitely some place that is so remote and so you are trapped some place very interesting
-ep-kud9hd8_16-5-rgb_front if you use the morse code and used that simple sos signal which is deet deet deet dah dah dah deet deet somebody is going to know you are in trouble
-ep-kud9hd8_17-5-rgb_front you can end up being saved or not saved if you do not learn the morse code
-ep-kud9hd8_2-5-rgb_front so what you have is this creates this flow of electrons through this wire coils
-ep-kud9hd8_3-5-rgb_front now then you produce this magnetic field right in here and thus you have the attraction
-ep-kud9hd8_4-5-rgb_front now you can imagine this
-ep-kud9hd8_5-5-rgb_front when this is done like say this part would be in one town and then you would have the wires running on a telegraph pole to another town
-ep-kud9hd8_6-5-rgb_front now of course if somebody snipped the wires and this often happened especially in the old western days when the natives would take it hear noise from these tall telegraph poles and all of a sudden just snip the wires because they knew again that this contributed somehow to more white people coming into their territories and this was something that they just obviously did not want
-ep-kud9hd8_7-5-rgb_front but the interesting thing about this is if you were the poor person that had the job of setting up the telegraph poles this was a deadly job because you were definitely killed by natives
-ep-kud9hd8_8-5-rgb_front they tried to stop you from putting these things up
-ep-kud9hd8_9-5-rgb_front and however it contributed to the advancement of communication where it was not just this little letter being delivered it was a series of beeps and sounds coming through
-eswgmd4xaq_0-5-rgb_front some of the common mistakes you may experience while learning how to do a frontside tailslide on a ledge is that you find it once you ollie into the tailslide sometimes you do not lock in right and you find it you land about like this
-eswgmd4xaq_1-5-rgb_front you can not tailslide that way at all
-eswgmd4xaq_10-5-rgb_front another problem people experience is coming out of a frontside tailslide and riding away almost straight away like a mini ramp
-eswgmd4xaq_11-5-rgb_front what you want to do is make sure that you can control your frontside tailslide and pop out ninety degrees and even add like a little bit of an ollie or at least come out nice and level
-eswgmd4xaq_12-5-rgb_front you do not want your tailslide to fall out and roll away even though you could
-eswgmd4xaq_13-5-rgb_front what you want to do is put a little tap on there and get out and roll away cleanly
-eswgmd4xaq_2-5-rgb_front you are not going to last very long on top of the ledge with your foot only there
-eswgmd4xaq_3-5-rgb_front it is going to end up falling off
-eswgmd4xaq_4-5-rgb_front so what you are going to want to do is to make sure you ollie high enough and land straight in the frontside tailslide and lock in the position
-eswgmd4xaq_5-5-rgb_front this is going to get you best tailslide possible
-eswgmd4xaq_6-5-rgb_front another problem you may experience is a tailslide sliding out
-eswgmd4xaq_7-5-rgb_front when you first learn how to tailslide on a ledge you are going to find out that maybe you are trying to push it a little too hard or maybe you put too much wax on top of the ledge
-eswgmd4xaq_8-5-rgb_front another thing could be that you have stickers on your tail that end up making it a little too slippery
-eswgmd4xaq_9-5-rgb_front so if you start to slide out that just means you need to lean a little more far forward to hold your tailslide a little steadier and a little bit longer
-evbw_nrsli_0-5-rgb_front ok so here once again we are in the fairway bunker
-evbw_nrsli_1-5-rgb_front i have got a shot at the green with my iron here
-evbw_nrsli_10-5-rgb_front this is not like hitting off the nice firm ground
-evbw_nrsli_11-5-rgb_front so i feel pretty comfortable here and i struck that one just right and i should be all over the pin with that one
-evbw_nrsli_12-5-rgb_front so this shot looks harder than it is but do not get discouraged
-evbw_nrsli_13-5-rgb_front if you practice your fairway sand shots it is going to have a great effect on your hitting the ball off the grass also
-evbw_nrsli_14-5-rgb_front because if you can hit out of this consistently hitting off the grass is easy
-evbw_nrsli_2-5-rgb_front so what i am going to do is i am going to look at the green so i am going to take my line on this ball so i want to get parallel to the line of flight of the ball however there is a tendency to fade the ball when you are hitting out of sand
-evbw_nrsli_3-5-rgb_front so you might want to correct for that but you know your own game
-evbw_nrsli_4-5-rgb_front so i want you to get a good solid stance be balanced because sand is loose and you do not want to have a bad when you take the club back you want to be in good balance
-evbw_nrsli_5-5-rgb_front because bad balance you will hit a bad shot
-evbw_nrsli_6-5-rgb_front because the sand is very unforgiving
-evbw_nrsli_7-5-rgb_front so that ball was pretty straight not quite as far as i would like
-evbw_nrsli_8-5-rgb_front so let is try one more here
-evbw_nrsli_9-5-rgb_front so when i am on sand i do kind of move my feet a lot because i am trying to find that perfect balance
-exhi3iqu7g_0-5-rgb_front my ten minutes are up and what i am going to do with my developer is i am just going to pour it down the drain
-exhi3iqu7g_1-5-rgb_front developer and stop bath are really technically the only things you should pour down the drain
-exhi3iqu7g_2-5-rgb_front do not ever pour your fix down the drain
-exhi3iqu7g_3-5-rgb_front once the developer is down i am going to take my stop bath and i am going to pour it in the same way take the cap off degree angle and pour it in
-exhi3iqu7g_4-5-rgb_front and again i want to make sure i fill it up all the way to the top put my cap back on
-exhi3iqu7g_5-5-rgb_front stop bath is one minute and for that first minute you agitate the whole minute
-exhi3iqu7g_6-5-rgb_front so again kind of recap i poured my developer down the drain when the ten minutes were up and then i poured my stop bath in
-exhi3iqu7g_7-5-rgb_front i am shaking my stop bath figure eights and i am getting ready because after this i am going to pour the stop bath down the drain and then i will get ready to use my fix
-eaisndrts4_0-5-rgb_front let is take our basic egyptian walk and travel in a circle with it
-eaisndrts4_1-5-rgb_front so let is start with the footwork
-eaisndrts4_10-5-rgb_front good
-eaisndrts4_11-5-rgb_front so we are going to travel to the right so we are going to step out with the right foot and feet together step back with the left foot feet together step together step together
-eaisndrts4_12-5-rgb_front so we are hitting the four corners of the room
-eaisndrts4_13-5-rgb_front let is try it again
-eaisndrts4_14-5-rgb_front ready and turn step together step hip step hip step and hip
-eaisndrts4_15-5-rgb_front good
-eaisndrts4_16-5-rgb_front try the other direction stepping left foot
-eaisndrts4_17-5-rgb_front left hip step face the back step face the side and step face forward
-eaisndrts4_18-5-rgb_front good
-eaisndrts4_19-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that everytime you turn that your knees line up in the same direction so that our knees are not going in two different directions
-eaisndrts4_2-5-rgb_front right foot left up on toe
-eaisndrts4_20-5-rgb_front you want to keep your body nice and align
-eaisndrts4_3-5-rgb_front left right on toe
-eaisndrts4_4-5-rgb_front make sure you are putting pressure on that ball of that foot
-eaisndrts4_5-5-rgb_front so it is going to be step touch so arms just out palms down facing away from the body
-eaisndrts4_6-5-rgb_front we call this a low ibis arm
-eaisndrts4_7-5-rgb_front step touch step and touch
-eaisndrts4_8-5-rgb_front and as you touch you are going to lift that hip
-eaisndrts4_9-5-rgb_front step touch
-egx2qfnmvi_0-5-rgb_front next step is to put on concealer
-egx2qfnmvi_1-5-rgb_front now a lot of women do not realize this but when you put concealer on the eyelid and put a little bit of powder on top it keeps your eyeshadow on all day and it keeps it from creasing
-egx2qfnmvi_10-5-rgb_front then you want to put it up over the whole lid close this is just going to even out the whole skin tone and make a beautiful pallet to start with and then on the other eye
-egx2qfnmvi_11-5-rgb_front tap it in
-egx2qfnmvi_12-5-rgb_front always make sure that everything is blended so you can take a peak and we are ready to go on to the next step
-egx2qfnmvi_2-5-rgb_front i know i have a lot of women that say they have there mascara on running or there eyeshadow creases or this would be keep it from doing that
-egx2qfnmvi_3-5-rgb_front when you put the concealer and the powder it keeps the oils from coming through and it will keep your mascara and keep everything in place
-egx2qfnmvi_4-5-rgb_front most important you definitely need to put on a eye cream
-egx2qfnmvi_5-5-rgb_front putting on a concealer on a dry eye is only going to make your eye look really dry because the eye would suck up the moisture from the concealer and it would start to go into the lines
-egx2qfnmvi_6-5-rgb_front so you just put your eye cream right at the corner edge and alway tap gently with your index finger
-egx2qfnmvi_7-5-rgb_front no rubbing or tugging or pulling on the eye
-egx2qfnmvi_8-5-rgb_front then you want to use a concealer about a shade lighter and i alway recommend just brushing it on
-egx2qfnmvi_9-5-rgb_front i recommend brushes for pretty much everything and tapping it with a finger afterwards just to smooth it out
-eryxkkckv8_0-5-rgb_front kirk vickers in the fitness world and the rehab world these physioballs have become real popular
-eryxkkckv8_1-5-rgb_front some people call them swiss balls
-eryxkkckv8_10-5-rgb_front we are just going to raise the leg and hold it for a count
-eryxkkckv8_11-5-rgb_front if we want to make this more challenging we can put our arms over our head and do the same thing
-eryxkkckv8_12-5-rgb_front switch legs hold it for a count
-eryxkkckv8_13-5-rgb_front for those of you that are just starting this it might be nice to have a wall close to you or put your ball close into a corner making sure that the ball does not touch the corner so you still have that stability and that movement through the ball
-eryxkkckv8_2-5-rgb_front but these balls can be a great training tool especially when we talk about core strengthening and core stability
-eryxkkckv8_3-5-rgb_front i am going to demonstrate a fairly simple movement that you can do on this to create more stability and control through the body and through the hips and the pelvis through that core region
-eryxkkckv8_4-5-rgb_front i want to set the ball down
-eryxkkckv8_5-5-rgb_front a quick note when we sit on the ball or when we are doing any seated motions on a physioball we want to make sure that our knees are in line with our hips
-eryxkkckv8_6-5-rgb_front we do not want our knees too high but we do not want to let knees too low
-eryxkkckv8_7-5-rgb_front as we put our feet straight out from under us and we have got this nice angle we should have a ball that stabilizes our hips
-eryxkkckv8_8-5-rgb_front it should come off straight off with the ball
-eryxkkckv8_9-5-rgb_front the movement that we are going to do here is we are going to activate the hip flexor and create a lot of core stability
-eumrdzvo74_0-5-rgb_front in this series i will talk about middleweight bicycles
-eumrdzvo74_1-5-rgb_front a lot of people confuse middleweight bicycles with balloon tire bicycles
-eumrdzvo74_10-5-rgb_front the tanks are slimmer
-eumrdzvo74_11-5-rgb_front the frames have thinner tubes and are much lighter and the gearing on the bicycle is different than on a balloon tire bicycle
-eumrdzvo74_12-5-rgb_front the front chain ring on these cycles is larger
-eumrdzvo74_13-5-rgb_front i will show you how to look at that and how you determine the general gear ratio of these cycles
-eumrdzvo74_14-5-rgb_front i will show you what manufacturers were successful and what items were not successful
-eumrdzvo74_2-5-rgb_front they use a generic term cruiser which could apply to a balloon tire bicycle or a middleweight bicycle but i will show you the difference between the two and what makes it a cruiser and not a cruiser
-eumrdzvo74_3-5-rgb_front i will talk about how to identify a true middleweight bicycle from a reproduction bicycle
-eumrdzvo74_4-5-rgb_front i will talk about the design influences
-eumrdzvo74_5-5-rgb_front the balloon tire bikes were designed like streamlined art deco motorcycles
-eumrdzvo74_6-5-rgb_front the middleweight bicycles have more of a space age look to them
-eumrdzvo74_7-5-rgb_front the rear racks will be more pointed
-eumrdzvo74_8-5-rgb_front the headlights will be integrated
-eumrdzvo74_9-5-rgb_front usually you have double headlights
-f0h1j3poag_0-5-rgb_front and welcome to the beautiful studios of valley free radio located in a basement
-f0h1j3poag_1-5-rgb_front anyway we are going to show you today the basics of how to do old school analog style broadcasting and a very low tech ancient style broadcasting studio
-f0h1j3poag_10-5-rgb_front all here at beautiful valley free radio
-f0h1j3poag_2-5-rgb_front so let is take a look at what we have got here
-f0h1j3poag_3-5-rgb_front of course the heart of any studio is your broadcast board so we are going to talk about all that in a minute
-f0h1j3poag_4-5-rgb_front and most of the rest of what you see are different things that are going to be inputs to the board
-f0h1j3poag_5-5-rgb_front got some cd players we have got another mixing board that goes as one input to the to the a to the board
-f0h1j3poag_6-5-rgb_front we have got a couple cassette players
-f0h1j3poag_7-5-rgb_front and we have a computer that we play is to and of course the telephone
-f0h1j3poag_8-5-rgb_front and we will also see how to put callers on the air
-f0h1j3poag_9-5-rgb_front other features of the station are some very kicking monitors microphones we will be talking about headphones you need when you are talking on the mike and some turntables
-f7htdz3kk0_0-5-rgb_front hello
-f7htdz3kk0_10-5-rgb_front so that is why they alternate and put in the direct quotations to begin with
-f7htdz3kk0_2-5-rgb_front let is look at candidates
-f7htdz3kk0_3-5-rgb_front here is another story about dan moraine of the los angeles times about the presidential race
-f7htdz3kk0_4-5-rgb_front we have got our lead here and we have got a quote immediately
-f7htdz3kk0_5-5-rgb_front then we have got another fact another fact then we have got a quote here a fact here a fact a fact and the rest of the story is a fact
-f7htdz3kk0_6-5-rgb_front so as you can see there are probably going to be more facts from there than direct quotations
-f7htdz3kk0_7-5-rgb_front you may ask why do you need direct quotations
-f7htdz3kk0_8_9-5-rgb_front why do not you just put the whole story in facts it breaks the monotony up and what people say exactly is going to be more exciting than just a bunch of facts
-f8uhzww9zs_0-5-rgb_front hello i am bruce marshall fashion designer and emmy award nominated costume designer here to talk to you about how you might want to dress to go hear the orchestra at the symphony da da da da da that is right
-f8uhzww9zs_1-5-rgb_front now one thing you should remember when you are at the symphony you are going to be sitting and you are going to be sitting for quite some time so really the most important thing is you want to wear something where you are going to be comfortable
-f8uhzww9zs_2-5-rgb_front and also you know it is pretty much a formal occasion so you want to be formal but not like black tie it is not necessary
-f8uhzww9zs_3-5-rgb_front but you definitely want to be comfortable so something with real soft fabrics that are pliable that will actually sit well is something you might want to think about wearing such as a velveteen or a velour just like demonstrated here
-f8uhzww9zs_4-5-rgb_front now you know the most important thing at the symphony is of course the music but you can also take some accessories to accessorize not just the music but yourself
-f8uhzww9zs_5-5-rgb_front for instance you can have a nice little flower in your boutonniere and you can make that really nice and shiny and flashy and fun
-f8uhzww9zs_6-5-rgb_front it could be as simple as a carnation even and it would still work or you could have a pocket square with nice little handkerchief or something with a detail that is gives it a little accent that would make the evening even a little bit more special because face it you do not wear stuff like this everyday
-f8uhzww9zs_7-5-rgb_front it is the symphony
-fc91wqrxio_0-3-rgb_front in this clip we will talk about what causes ocd or obsessive compulsive disorder
-fc91wqrxio_1-3-rgb_front although it is not really known exactly what does cause ocd we do know that environmental and biological factors do play a major role in the development of ocd
-fc91wqrxio_2-3-rgb_front when i talk about environmental factors what i am actually talking about are things that occur either in the individuals immediate environment such as your family your workspace or in the surrounding community or world
-fc91wqrxio_3-3-rgb_front so it is things such as major traumatic events environmental things such as tornadoes hurricanes any kind of things that might lead to traumas
-fc91wqrxio_4-3-rgb_front things as simple as sometimes getting married changing a job or losing a job having a baby anything that is related to your environment can be a trigger
-fc91wqrxio_5-3-rgb_front now it does not mean that if you decide to get married and have a hurricane in the same year that you will automatically develop ocd
-fc91wqrxio_6-3-rgb_front they just noticed a link that between environmental stressors there is an elevated link in risk that you might develop ocd
-fc91wqrxio_7-3-rgb_front but then again there is always the thought that you would have to be prone to developing ocd to begin with so the environmental factors are actually a trigger and not necessarily a cause
-fngnonv_3i_1-5-rgb_front this episode we are talking about snake bunkers
-fngnonv_3i_10-5-rgb_front it is a crawl everybody is familiar with
-fngnonv_3i_11-5-rgb_front but we are going to modify it because of this thing a paintball marker that you probably do not want to let go of and the rules do not let you just throw it in front of you and go to town
-fngnonv_3i_12-5-rgb_front so it is going to be two knees one hand and you are just going to crawl all the way along
-fngnonv_3i_13-5-rgb_front except in this bunker it is not really an option because you will notice in the tiger crawl the position i am in right now i am actually over the top of the bunker so which means my pack my head and yeah everything is pretty much exposed
-fngnonv_3i_14-5-rgb_front so the best crawl for this is a leopard crawl which is down on your knees and down on your elbows and you are going to crawl pretty much like that
-fngnonv_3i_15-5-rgb_front i am not doing that again
-fngnonv_3i_16-5-rgb_front one more thing to mention about crawling and this is more of a health issue than anything else
-fngnonv_3i_17-5-rgb_front when you are crawling on one good hand make sure that you do not go palm down
-fngnonv_3i_18-5-rgb_front it is a natural to want to do when you are want to put your palm down like this
-fngnonv_3i_19-5-rgb_front the problem is you can hyper extend yourself
-fngnonv_3i_2-5-rgb_front every field every air ball field every arena field has a snake bunker
-fngnonv_3i_20-5-rgb_front you can actually blow out your wrist if you are not careful
-fngnonv_3i_21-5-rgb_front that being said what i try to do when i am crawling is i make my hand into a fist and walk on my fist and my knees
-fngnonv_3i_22-5-rgb_front it does not always work out that way but that is what you want to try to do
-fngnonv_3i_23-5-rgb_front one other thing speaking of health issues if you think you are going to be crawling on a particular day and you have bad wrists or you have bad joints take preventative measures
-fngnonv_3i_24-5-rgb_front i have got my wrist taped up from here to here using some medical tape
-fngnonv_3i_25-5-rgb_front some of the stretchy stuff that is pretty good
-fngnonv_3i_26-5-rgb_front if you think you are going to do any crawling and you are afraid of blowing out your ankles or blowing out your wrists or something like that be prepared
-fngnonv_3i_3-5-rgb_front it might not look as straight as this snake bunker but trust me there is always a low crawling area for you sneaky crawly types
-fngnonv_3i_4-5-rgb_front when you find the snake and you want to take the snake bunker you want to get in here first thing you want to do before the game walk the field get down to the snake level and inspect the field
-fngnonv_3i_5-5-rgb_front you are looking for what position you need to be in what large bunker you need to be behind in order to do the most damage to the other team
-fngnonv_3i_6-5-rgb_front sometimes it is not going to be the position you think it is
-fngnonv_3i_7-5-rgb_front you do not know until you get down here and you put your eyeball on this bunker
-fngnonv_3i_8-5-rgb_front when you are calling a snake what you want to do is a modified tiger pun intended that is actually what it is called
-fngnonv_3i_9-5-rgb_front tiger crawl is two hands two knees and you are just going to go like this
-for83fbsp4_1-3-rgb_front i wanted to talk to you about some things not to do when training your bird
-for83fbsp4_2-3-rgb_front when you decide to train your bird do not switch locations that you train your bird every time you train them stick to one place have a set area in which you train your bird and they are familiar with if your switching it around every time you switch their training area it is going to confuse them they are going to be more distracted by their environment than they are interested in learning any new behaviors
-for83fbsp4_3-3-rgb_front birds need to be very comfortable in their environment to preform especially shyer birds like greys i have had a very difficult time showing any behaviors that these birds know today because there is lights and camera and unfamiliar people in the household and it is a very very good way to get no response out of your bird at all
-for83fbsp4_4-3-rgb_front other things you do not want to have in the household at the same time is a lot of other activities going on obviously you do not want people cooking at the same time in the background you do not want the dog running through the house at the same time
-for83fbsp4_5-3-rgb_front you want to make sure that at the very begining and the end of every training session you start and end on a positive note no matter what happens the bird does not understand whats going on
-for83fbsp4_6-3-rgb_front always make sure do not end that session with the bird does not get it you are frustrated you are angry and you just put the bird away that is the very worst way that you could ever end that for one you are not going to try training your bird again anytime soon and your bird is certainly not going to want to be trained again anytime soon because last time he tried and set out in that location and was with you he did not have a good time
-for83fbsp4_7-3-rgb_front you want to make sure that just your household environment is conducive to learning it is the same thing as having a child you just do not want tons of distractions television on and that sort of thing when trying to teach new behaviors to your bird
-fprgga3qyy_0-5-rgb_front laura banford now i am going to illustrate some basic hand positions and movements with the chef is knife
-fprgga3qyy_1-5-rgb_front this is my chef is knife
-fprgga3qyy_10-5-rgb_front so we are going to make kind of a uniform it is not too uniform uniform dices there
-fprgga3qyy_11-5-rgb_front i have my knife in my hand okay
-fprgga3qyy_12-5-rgb_front knife lies like this across your fingers
-fprgga3qyy_13-5-rgb_front you wrap your fingers around
-fprgga3qyy_14-5-rgb_front turn your knife perpendicular to your cutting board
-fprgga3qyy_15-5-rgb_front make sure your cutting board is not going to move
-fprgga3qyy_16-5-rgb_front anchor it nice and tight there okay
-fprgga3qyy_17-5-rgb_front with your left hand or your hand you are going to have your fingers curved
-fprgga3qyy_18-5-rgb_front and you are going to slice starting with about an inch from the tip and rocking down
-fprgga3qyy_19-5-rgb_front you are going to use a rocking motion
-fprgga3qyy_2-5-rgb_front it is the one i go to for most utilitarian tasks
-fprgga3qyy_20-5-rgb_front and then you are going to slide your knife slightly ahead
-fprgga3qyy_21-5-rgb_front as you do that and do it slowly to learn you are going to move your hand your fingers or your hand back so they are always out of range of the knife
-fprgga3qyy_22-5-rgb_front again they are curved under and the knife you have a rocking motion
-fprgga3qyy_23-5-rgb_front as you pick up confidence you can increase your speed
-fprgga3qyy_24-5-rgb_front i made a mistake there
-fprgga3qyy_25-5-rgb_front never drag the edge of your knife along the cutting board
-fprgga3qyy_26-5-rgb_front it dulls it
-fprgga3qyy_27-5-rgb_front always use the spine of the knife
-fprgga3qyy_28-5-rgb_front let is turn them over this time so that they do not move as much
-fprgga3qyy_29-5-rgb_front a little rocking motion
-fprgga3qyy_3-5-rgb_front and i have selected celery because it has nice even stalks and it is a good good way to practice
-fprgga3qyy_30-5-rgb_front those are coming out more uniform
-fprgga3qyy_31-5-rgb_front i guess we should do it cupped down see
-fprgga3qyy_32-5-rgb_front those are coming out nice and uniform
-fprgga3qyy_33-5-rgb_front always moving your fingers back
-fprgga3qyy_34-5-rgb_front when we come back we are going to use a cleaver
-fprgga3qyy_4-5-rgb_front and again celery is inexpensive so if you want to practice yourself it is a good way to do it
-fprgga3qyy_5-5-rgb_front okay
-fprgga3qyy_6-5-rgb_front i have two celery stalks with the bottoms and the tops bottoms and tops cleaned off
-fprgga3qyy_7-5-rgb_front what i am going to do actually it should be like this
-fprgga3qyy_8-5-rgb_front let is say you want to make diced celery
-fprgga3qyy_9-5-rgb_front i am going to cut down with the tip of my knife
-fsi2e1pqky_0-5-rgb_front hello
-fsi2e1pqky_10-5-rgb_front paint rag is going to be your best friend
-fsi2e1pqky_11-5-rgb_front especially if working oils oftentimes you will have hours to days to fix this
-fsi2e1pqky_12-5-rgb_front if you are working on acrylics your window is down to minutes
-fsi2e1pqky_13-5-rgb_front they are so fast drying
-fsi2e1pqky_14-5-rgb_front take your towel basically very simply wipe the paint away
-fsi2e1pqky_15-5-rgb_front be thorough with this keep wiping until basically very little paint is coming off on your paper towel
-fsi2e1pqky_16-5-rgb_front if your paper towel is saturated get another one
-fsi2e1pqky_17-5-rgb_front do not stop just because you ran out of paper towels
-fsi2e1pqky_18-5-rgb_front now your canvas is relatively pure again
-fsi2e1pqky_19-5-rgb_front it is not going to be exactly how a bare canvas is but it is going to be good enough for you to start coming back in here with your red
-fsi2e1pqky_2-5-rgb_front the next technique we are going to cover is simply correcting
-fsi2e1pqky_20-5-rgb_front i am going to come back in here and blend her up over the blue however you like it now the blue is a lot more subdued
-fsi2e1pqky_21-5-rgb_front you have a red here and all because you took the time basically to wipe it away and repaint
-fsi2e1pqky_22-5-rgb_front that is the biggest thing
-fsi2e1pqky_23-5-rgb_front do not ever think of a painting as a static thing
-fsi2e1pqky_24-5-rgb_front i have even seen paintings entirely dry where an artist goes no i am not happy and they will paint even over the dry under painting completely
-fsi2e1pqky_3-5-rgb_front it is how to make up for those little mistakes or when your painting does not quite go in the direction you imagined it should go in
-fsi2e1pqky_4-5-rgb_front take for example this area here
-fsi2e1pqky_5-5-rgb_front let is say the blue looks really really great but you know what
-fsi2e1pqky_6-5-rgb_front i d want this to be a lot more red up here and i do not if i blend the red in here it is going to look like a red purple and it is not what i want to do
-fsi2e1pqky_7-5-rgb_front what do i do
-fsi2e1pqky_8-5-rgb_front how do i fix this
-fsi2e1pqky_9-5-rgb_front mr paper towel or mr
-fqh6k6uous_0-5-rgb_front hi in the segment we are going to be talking about a trick catch called the flamingosis
-fqh6k6uous_1-5-rgb_front now a flamingosis is very similar to the flamingo
-fqh6k6uous_10-5-rgb_front spin around swing your leg over the top of the frisbee
-fqh6k6uous_11-5-rgb_front that is very important i am going to try another one
-fqh6k6uous_12-5-rgb_front i am going to set it here spin around and catch it there
-fqh6k6uous_13-5-rgb_front flamingosis you can do you can add spins before them
-fqh6k6uous_14-5-rgb_front you could do it off of a roll set
-fqh6k6uous_15-5-rgb_front you can do it off of a lot of different sets or even a throw but the flamingosis is a really cool catch
-fqh6k6uous_2-5-rgb_front with the flamingo actually going to be catching it with one leg
-fqh6k6uous_3-5-rgb_front on one leg with the other leg lifted
-fqh6k6uous_4-5-rgb_front this is a flamingo catch
-fqh6k6uous_5-5-rgb_front you also want to keep the leg nice and straight and the toe pointed as much as possible
-fqh6k6uous_6-5-rgb_front now with a flaming is your going to be spinning the opposite direction rather than spinning into the catch your going to be spinning away from the catch and catching it here
-fqh6k6uous_7-5-rgb_front so in order to do that you need to have the set come right on the outside of your knee
-fqh6k6uous_8-5-rgb_front so when you turn the first view will be right here
-fqh6k6uous_9-5-rgb_front so we are going to try that one now with a self set i am going to have the frisbee here i am going set it
-fyftnt9w9q_0-5-rgb_front okay if you as you have watched these segments you will see that tennis is a very athletic game and i want you to think about if i am hitting a forehand like this well one of the great poses in martial arts or in yoga is a pose like this
-fyftnt9w9q_1-5-rgb_front so this is very good for you to do
-fyftnt9w9q_10-5-rgb_front so i want you to think about holding some poses and developing that type of fitness because tennis is a very very it demands a lot out of you and you have got to put a lot into it
-fyftnt9w9q_2-5-rgb_front so you will hold this pose it is going to strengthen your legs and it is going to do so without any risk of injury because you are not moving any weights you are not on a hard surface
-fyftnt9w9q_3-5-rgb_front so you just hold this pose ideally hold it for a minute or longer and that means you are going to be pretty strong in the mid section and in the upper legs and you will have good endurance and then just go to other side
-fyftnt9w9q_4-5-rgb_front so just think of your backhand now
-fyftnt9w9q_5-5-rgb_front so in martial arts or in yoga they call this a warrior pose
-fyftnt9w9q_6-5-rgb_front so you can see i am getting and i am hitting the ball and you end up like this
-fyftnt9w9q_7-5-rgb_front so you have to be strong in the legs and in this part of the legs
-fyftnt9w9q_8-5-rgb_front so you hold this pose and you will be amazed once again how much better your balance gets
-fyftnt9w9q_9-5-rgb_front a lot of people because they are not strong when they are going for a ball they are balance is bad they are weak
0-0kx3xompq_0-3-rgb_front alright folks in this series we are drawing magical objects and in this clip i am going to teach you how to draw a magic lamp
0-0kx3xompq_1-3-rgb_front i am going to do that right down here
0-0kx3xompq_10-3-rgb_front come on down just like that and then obviously we will add some details to it just to make it look more interesting just like that and then you know if you want to you can add a polished sort of shine to it if you want and texture it a bit just to make it look a bit more interesting but that is basically it
0-0kx3xompq_11-3-rgb_front the genie is magic lamp
0-0kx3xompq_2-3-rgb_front so obviously you know the story roughly behind the magic lamp
0-0kx3xompq_3-3-rgb_front everyone is sort of familiar with the little genie thing
0-0kx3xompq_4-3-rgb_front what we are going to do is we are going to start by drawing the rough shape and i would say the rough shape of a lamp a magic lamp is almost like the head of an elephant
0-0kx3xompq_5-3-rgb_front it has got a little head and then what we will do you might equate to a long snout trunk
0-0kx3xompq_6-3-rgb_front so we will come in here and we will draw the tip of the lamp first and that is obviously where the magic happens right there
0-0kx3xompq_7-3-rgb_front then we will come up here and we will draw the top the little lid where they have obviously pour in the oil and things like that
0-0kx3xompq_8-3-rgb_front and then we come in here and we will draw the handle something like this right there
0-0kx3xompq_9-3-rgb_front then the base which would be something like this that it has got to be able to stand on
0-4j8fghnoe_1-5-rgb_front so now were going to get fresh garlic here is our fresh garlic definitely go out and get some fresh garlic
0-4j8fghnoe_2-5-rgb_front there is no other way to make some fresh bruschetta than to use the whole fresh ingredients you have your garlic were going to use a lot of it
0-4j8fghnoe_3-5-rgb_front just take your butchers knife and just give it a good from the point down slam it like so give it a good punch like that
0-4j8fghnoe_4-5-rgb_front you will see it will break apart real easy were going to use about cloves sounds like a lot of garlic but it is a great dish i know listen about the good thing about garlic is very good for you
0-4j8fghnoe_5-5-rgb_front it is very good for you and if everybody eats garlic nobody has garlic breath so make sure everybody eats a little bit of this
0-4j8fghnoe_6-5-rgb_front when i get back were going to start chopping up the individual garlic putting it together make sure you get some fresh garlic for this
0-4j8fghnoe_7-5-rgb_front it is very important you want about cloves this is a clove inside your garlic so you want about of those when i come back we will start chopping it up and i will show you how to get it out of there as well
0-ch0nkregk_0-5-rgb_front let is talk about why acupuncture can help us control weight
0-ch0nkregk_1-5-rgb_front the first mechanism we already mentioned balancing the nervous system to control the appetite
0-ch0nkregk_2-5-rgb_front and the second one is acupuncture help induce the endorphin
0-ch0nkregk_3-5-rgb_front we mentioned that about make us feel good and it relieve the pain
0-ch0nkregk_4-5-rgb_front but another effect of can have is control our appetite
0-ch0nkregk_5-5-rgb_front for instance when you run miles and you pass your second wind then you feel so good so energetic then you do not want to eat for a while
0-ch0nkregk_6-5-rgb_front but if you do not exercise you sit in front of tv for the whole evening then you just keep eating
0-ch0nkregk_7-5-rgb_front it seems you never get satisfied with the food
0-ch0nkregk_8-5-rgb_front and if you eat the wrong food then it is very easy for you to gain pounds within a year
0-i67scsfie_1-5-rgb_front and in this segment i am just going to explain a little bit how we are going to wrap up our mural
0-i67scsfie_10-5-rgb_front so as soon as i get my letters painted in then i can in with a pencil then i can paint it in
0-i67scsfie_2-5-rgb_front we are doing a construction sign here and it is going to going to put another put coat on it so it is a solid orange like a real construction sign
0-i67scsfie_3-5-rgb_front and then we are going to put caution boys at work and we will do that in black writing so it looks like one
0-i67scsfie_4-5-rgb_front and then i have taped it off right here so when i paint in my post for this to be in the foreground then it looks like it is standing on a post in the foreground and then you have got the construction in the background
0-i67scsfie_5-5-rgb_front after we are done with that i am just going to put in a little bit of shadows on the bottom
0-i67scsfie_6-5-rgb_front you can use a stencil to put in your lettering if you ever do lettering
0-i67scsfie_7-5-rgb_front i like to my mine in
0-i67scsfie_8-5-rgb_front i will usually ruler it out and tape it in line so your words are really straight on there but stencils work too
0-i67scsfie_9-5-rgb_front and what i would do is i would do another coat on this let it dry and then i would pencil in my letters so i get it right with my paint
0-qttpowp_8_0-5-rgb_front the next step once you have your wreath up here on a horizontal surface excuse me a vertical surface is you need to start going ahead and anchoring your flowers in
0-qttpowp_8_1-5-rgb_front again what i use is the wire and i make sure that everything that is holding horizontal is wrapped and i will even wrap the wire up a stem of the flower to make sure that it is held on correctly come down and wrap it around the main frame
0-qttpowp_8_2-5-rgb_front this is something you need to make sure you do when you are outside in the weather because you do not want it to be blown away so you can create all these little tracks of wire and wrap it around the flowers to help hold it stable
0-qttpowp_8_3-5-rgb_front the next thing you do after that is you can go ahead and start adding any other kind of flowers or fill into it with a hot glue gun and then you can tuck them into your little pockets of wire and base material that you started
0-qttpowp_8_4-5-rgb_front so the next part is going ahead and anchoring all your flowers on a vertical place so that they will stay and you have to deal with the wind and elements of the weather
0-_hooxzsww_0-5-rgb_front so in this segment we are going to continue with the idea of testing rooting with a partner
0-_hooxzsww_1-5-rgb_front so as in the last one we already the idea is that ray is using his mind to redirect my force downward
0-_hooxzsww_10-5-rgb_front again it is not win lose it is the idea to increase the sensitivity of our rootedness
0-_hooxzsww_11-5-rgb_front so as i push he roots he roots he roots and i am pushing pretty hard right now
0-_hooxzsww_12-5-rgb_front now why do we do it this way
0-_hooxzsww_13-5-rgb_front it is the most vulnerable position
0-_hooxzsww_14-5-rgb_front so if he just stands up and does not try and root and i push him it takes no effort to push him over
0-_hooxzsww_15-5-rgb_front that is why we do it here so you can really see that you really were rooting that energy
0-_hooxzsww_2-5-rgb_front but as i start pushing harder and harder there is a mind set that you want to resist that
0-_hooxzsww_3-5-rgb_front so what what a lot of times happens is the person leans into it to not let you push them
0-_hooxzsww_4-5-rgb_front they think that that is rooting
0-_hooxzsww_5-5-rgb_front but really it is not rooting because look at what happened
0-_hooxzsww_6-5-rgb_front right so also the other mistake is that you are pushing hard and not able to root so you start leaning back leaning back and then you could push that person over
0-_hooxzsww_7-5-rgb_front so it is very important that it is a good partner relationship
0-_hooxzsww_8-5-rgb_front so as i start pushing if i start pushing too hard he is not able to root and he feels himself resisting he tells me back off a little bit
0-_hooxzsww_9-5-rgb_front or if i find that he is resisting then i back off a little bit
0-br2rq-qps_0-5-rgb_front harmonie krieger astringent is really important and i do not think people do this enough
0-br2rq-qps_1-5-rgb_front this is something that is so easy
0-br2rq-qps_10-5-rgb_front so you are going to take cotton swabs and you can use one or two
0-br2rq-qps_11-5-rgb_front now the thing to be careful about astringent it is very piercing to your skin
0-br2rq-qps_12-5-rgb_front so you feel kind of like a tingle so you do not want to put too much on it once
0-br2rq-qps_13-5-rgb_front so basically you are going to just do a couple of drops almost like eye makeup remover
0-br2rq-qps_14-5-rgb_front and you are going to take it and you are going to go all over the face
0-br2rq-qps_15-5-rgb_front so you are going to take this and you are going to rub it all over everywhere your nose over your eyes on your forehead
0-br2rq-qps_16-5-rgb_front make sure you get every single place because this is what is going to clean all of the excess dirt that you did not get with your exfoliator
0-br2rq-qps_17-5-rgb_front so even if you take a shower and you feel your face is super clean always use the astringent after
0-br2rq-qps_18-5-rgb_front and it does tingle but i like the tingle because it makes me feel that i am getting all dirt off my face
0-br2rq-qps_19-5-rgb_front does not that feel refreshing
0-br2rq-qps_2-5-rgb_front after you have washed your face or you come out of the shower i love this because it is so refreshing
0-br2rq-qps_20-5-rgb_front and then if you look at your cotton swab you will see just how much dirt you really have on your face
0-br2rq-qps_21-5-rgb_front we will not look at yours do not worry
0-br2rq-qps_22-5-rgb_front and then just make sure you throw that away
0-br2rq-qps_23-5-rgb_front and just have a stack of cotton swabs that you can always use
0-br2rq-qps_24-5-rgb_front i always buy a pack of like a hundred or so and it looks like this
0-br2rq-qps_25-5-rgb_front again i got this at rite aid
0-br2rq-qps_26-5-rgb_front the whole package was a and it will last to about two months
0-br2rq-qps_27-5-rgb_front so again use your astringent twice a day after the shower after you wash your face
0-br2rq-qps_3-5-rgb_front this is to prevent acne
0-br2rq-qps_4-5-rgb_front now a lot of people need to prevent acne
0-br2rq-qps_5-5-rgb_front and when they do have acne it is a great way to prevent more acne
0-br2rq-qps_6-5-rgb_front so this is by clean amp clear and you can get this in the drugstore for about
0-br2rq-qps_7-5-rgb_front clean amp clear is just as good as any of those products from the spa and i love to do this probably three times a day
0-br2rq-qps_8-5-rgb_front now what you are going to do is make sure you have a bunch of cotton swabs
0-br2rq-qps_9-5-rgb_front this is also a great way to take off your makeup and i am going to show you that in a second
0-n5ybn2iza_0-5-rgb_front once we have sealed one end of the rain stick were ready to pour our rice inside and close off the other end
0-n5ybn2iza_1-5-rgb_front the easiest way to do this is to put your rice into a plastic bag and then just put the mouth of the paper bag inside of the paper towel roll and tilt the bag over so all the rice will spill right inside
0-n5ybn2iza_10-5-rgb_front so we go ahead and put it around and fold the excess right over the top and once we have gone around and we feel that its in place then we can go ahead and put some tape right along the bottom
0-n5ybn2iza_11-5-rgb_front so now our rain stick has been totally sealed we have the rice inside and as we move it back and forth we will see that it going to its going to sound like the rain falling
0-n5ybn2iza_12-5-rgb_front hitting a window
0-n5ybn2iza_13-5-rgb_front hitting a roof or just falling outside
0-n5ybn2iza_14-5-rgb_front so now i shown you how to place the rice inside our rain stick and seal the end with the lid and masking tape
0-n5ybn2iza_2-5-rgb_front if you do not do it this way then you can use some type of funnel or something where the mouth fits inside the end of the rain stick and you can just pour the rice right inside
0-n5ybn2iza_3-5-rgb_front but this is easiest way
0-n5ybn2iza_4-5-rgb_front so once all the rice is inside were going to go ahead and seal the top of the stick
0-n5ybn2iza_5-5-rgb_front we put the other lid the other circle that we cut out over the top and we do the same thing it should fit right on it should not slip inside because of the thickness of the roll will help keep it on
0-n5ybn2iza_6-5-rgb_front just sitting on the outside and then we go ahead and take some masking tape and put it around the outside of the lid
0-n5ybn2iza_7-5-rgb_front around the roll and that helps create a seal
0-n5ybn2iza_8-5-rgb_front we should put a few layers just like we did before and again this is going to help prevent any of the rice from falling out
0-n5ybn2iza_9-5-rgb_front it creates a nice tight seal and really want to make sure that that lid stays place
0-vro9sz5ow_0-5-rgb_front the next thing we are going to do is we are going to stretch out our back
0-vro9sz5ow_1-5-rgb_front so anytime you work your abs you want to stretch your back work your back and then stretch your back out
0-vro9sz5ow_10-5-rgb_front but for right now this is good
0-vro9sz5ow_11-5-rgb_front and once you have held this for about twenty to thirty seconds you want to slowly come up bring in your head up first then your hands then come back up to that seated position
0-vro9sz5ow_12-5-rgb_front and that is a great way to stretch out your abs and your back on the stability ball
0-vro9sz5ow_2-5-rgb_front so this is going to be a really great stretch for your abs and for your back
0-vro9sz5ow_3-5-rgb_front it is a modified back bend on the ball it feels really great on your spine
0-vro9sz5ow_4-5-rgb_front and anybody of any age can do this
0-vro9sz5ow_5-5-rgb_front if you need some assistance please use somebody to help you if you are a little nervous or if you get sick going backwards cause sometimes that can happen too
0-vro9sz5ow_6-5-rgb_front you want to take your feet they are out they are about hip width apart and you want to slowly go back especially if you have not done this before rolling your butt forward slowly come back bring your hands down
0-vro9sz5ow_7-5-rgb_front some people are going to be a little more nervous than others but eventually what you want to do is you want to get both of your hands flat on the floor just like this and both of your feet are flat on the floor
0-vro9sz5ow_8-5-rgb_front now different stability balls will give you different different opportunities to stretch your back at different levels
0-vro9sz5ow_9-5-rgb_front this is actually really good what i have here i could go for a little bit of a larger stability ball but i wanted to go for a little bit of a deeper stretch
0-wloko5znw_1-5-rgb_front in this kitchen we are going to be putting down wood flooring and we need to calculate how much flooring to buy
0-wloko5znw_2-5-rgb_front the first thing i did was draw up a basic floor plan of the kitchen now my wood floors are going to go in the areas with red they do go below the stove and the fridge but not underneath the cabinetry
0-wloko5znw_3-5-rgb_front what i need to do to calculate the flooring is figure out the square footage so i am going to break the kitchen up into four different sections
0-wloko5znw_4-5-rgb_front this one will be number one number two number three and number four i am going to go through and measure the width and the length of each section and record the data
0-wloko5znw_5-5-rgb_front so what i done is come up with my four sections i have measured each section and wrote down my measurements on this last one it was feet x feet
0-wloko5znw_6-5-rgb_front i have then multiple those two measurements together which gave me my total square footage for each section
0-wloko5znw_7-5-rgb_front then i am going to go ahead and add all of those up and that is going to give me square feet
0-wloko5znw_8-5-rgb_front now it is always good to add about to your materials for waist so i have my materials of square feet i am going to add so i am going to multiple it by
0-wloko5znw_9-5-rgb_front that is going to give me a total of square feet and i might as well rounded right up to square feet
0-zewtxhur8_0-5-rgb_front hi
0-zewtxhur8_2-5-rgb_front in this segment we will be talking about supplies needed
0-zewtxhur8_3-5-rgb_front the first thing that you will need will be the galvanic spa unit from nu skin
0-zewtxhur8_4-5-rgb_front you will also need the treatment face gels
0-zewtxhur8_5-5-rgb_front you will need the pretreatment and the treatment gel for the application
0-zewtxhur8_6-5-rgb_front you will need scissors if going off site to open up the gels cotton rounds to remove makeup headband to keep the hair off the face and a washcloth to cleanse the face in between applications
0-zewtxhur8_7-5-rgb_front always remember to have water because our hand will need to be moist at the back of the galvanic spa unit
0-zewtxhur8_8-5-rgb_front watch our next segment on reading the display
001evy9d-mw_1-5-rgb_front now we are going to talk about the smallest of all of the stripes on the food pyramid the yellow one right here which you can barely see
001evy9d-mw_10-5-rgb_front and that is all there is for the oils group
001evy9d-mw_2-5-rgb_front that is the oils food group
001evy9d-mw_3-5-rgb_front it is not technically a food group but some oils an contribute to good health if you are getting the right ones
001evy9d-mw_4-5-rgb_front healthy oils can be found in fish nuts corn oil soybean oil olive oil or canola oil
001evy9d-mw_5-5-rgb_front now most kids get enough of their daily intake from this category without actually having to make an effort to add things in
001evy9d-mw_6-5-rgb_front the recommended daily allowance for children four to five years old is four to five teaspoons
001evy9d-mw_7-5-rgb_front a teaspoon is that big
001evy9d-mw_8-5-rgb_front as you can see it is not very big
001evy9d-mw_9-5-rgb_front now one teaspoon is half a tablespoon of mayo half a tablespoon of margarine or butter eight olives without the pits one tablespoon of italian salad dressing or half an ounce of nuts
002phlzgeq8_0-5-rgb_front this edged weapon defense is a straight stab once again
002phlzgeq8_1-5-rgb_front it is a wrist control
002phlzgeq8_10-5-rgb_front now i can either throw him to the ground
002phlzgeq8_11-5-rgb_front i can kick him in the leg
002phlzgeq8_12-5-rgb_front i can blast him in the side with the hilt of this other knife
002phlzgeq8_13-5-rgb_front the thousand things i can do but before we do that we have got to get the knife away
002phlzgeq8_14-5-rgb_front so i am inside
002phlzgeq8_15-5-rgb_front he starts to pull it back
002phlzgeq8_16-5-rgb_front it is fine i go with it
002phlzgeq8_17-5-rgb_front here i have the whole hand locked up
002phlzgeq8_18-5-rgb_front he is exposed his center is raised up
002phlzgeq8_19-5-rgb_front twist that grab the blade here turn it out of his hand
002phlzgeq8_2-5-rgb_front we previously went to the outside
002phlzgeq8_20-5-rgb_front more than likely i would have simply throw him to the ground project him as far away from me as possible
002phlzgeq8_21-5-rgb_front before any of that happens you have got to be off the line
002phlzgeq8_22-5-rgb_front he pulls back and we go
002phlzgeq8_23-5-rgb_front zonk you for wrist control inside wrist turn pull it away slam into the ground and that is a good technique for an inside wrist control
002phlzgeq8_3-5-rgb_front let is say that we are going to be forced to the inside this time and i come in
002phlzgeq8_4-5-rgb_front i still am going to hook it and catch it
002phlzgeq8_5-5-rgb_front i do not want catch the blade obviously
002phlzgeq8_6-5-rgb_front make for a short defense
002phlzgeq8_7-5-rgb_front i want to grab as much as i can here
002phlzgeq8_8-5-rgb_front daniel is already spread out but as with our other technique he is not going to leave his hand out there
002phlzgeq8_9-5-rgb_front he is going to start to fight to get it back and as he does i am going to go with him and spiral that hand back around inside turn this completely back into him and yank the knife away
003d1chlnqs_0-5-rgb_front let is do a quick example of the game ship captain and crew and then for the rest of this series we will work on it in detail
003d1chlnqs_1-5-rgb_front in a turn of ship captain and crew you get three rolls and you are trying to build first a ship then have a captain assigned to it and then collect a crew and then cargo
003d1chlnqs_10-5-rgb_front and it is six plus five which is eleven plus four which is fifteen plus eight more
003d1chlnqs_11-5-rgb_front and there you have it
003d1chlnqs_12-5-rgb_front that is ship captain and crew
003d1chlnqs_13-5-rgb_front we will go into detail in this series
003d1chlnqs_2-5-rgb_front well the ship equals number six
003d1chlnqs_3-5-rgb_front on my first roll i have no sixes
003d1chlnqs_4-5-rgb_front so i have to roll again
003d1chlnqs_5-5-rgb_front aha there i rolled a six so i have my ship
003d1chlnqs_6-5-rgb_front alas there are no fives no captain
003d1chlnqs_7-5-rgb_front and i only get one more roll so let is hope this goes better
003d1chlnqs_8-5-rgb_front well there is a five so there is my captain and a die with four on it equals the crew and then once you have that once you have ship which is six captain which is five and crew which is four you can use the remaining dice for your cargo
003d1chlnqs_9-5-rgb_front in this case it is a five and a three and so now i would score my points
005j20-polw_0-5-rgb_front o k
005j20-polw_1-5-rgb_front now that we have got this set i am going to go ahead and get the side walls a little damp
005j20-polw_10-5-rgb_front i can tell the thickness on the bottom was perfect because i can see this moving through the bottom alright
005j20-polw_11-5-rgb_front and then you want to get it off the wheel head we are going to set it up then we are going to put some ears on it
005j20-polw_2-5-rgb_front alright so picking it up just a little bit we can keep it nice and thick on top there o k
005j20-polw_3-5-rgb_front bring it up about right there let me grab some more clay from the bottom
005j20-polw_4-5-rgb_front it can be a little thinner on the inside but these rims right here they need to stay nice and fat o k
005j20-polw_5-5-rgb_front at this point i got the height that i want and there is another things this tools great for not only is it great for going back putting your mark in see look a little swirl alright
005j20-polw_6_7-5-rgb_front come in give it that classic casserole body right there classic o k just like that and then do some wheel trimming here and there is going to be a lot of goop that comes out of the bottom there
005j20-polw_8-5-rgb_front with a form like this i do not like to get it too funky i like it to be a little civilized
005j20-polw_9-5-rgb_front but that is it right there and you want to go ahead take this tool needle the wire tool nice and flat and like this out off to the left
006dxpj9erw_1-5-rgb_front now headshots are the most important thing that you can add to your resume in the industry
006dxpj9erw_2-5-rgb_front not going to get anywhere without a headshot they can tell you to take a couple of flashes a couple of quick pictures and send it to them but ultimately going to come back and call you back and say you know what we need a professional headshot of in order to submit it to their client

006dxpj9erw_4-5-rgb_front not the school picture headshot a professional acting modeling headshot
006dxpj9erw_5-5-rgb_front now the headshot is going to cover about that much of your head its not a full body shot its more like a length shot you want to have your shoulders in the headshot in order to submit it
006dxpj9erw_6-5-rgb_front you can submit it in either a black and white or a color but you want to have a headshot with your resume
006dxpj9erw_7-5-rgb_front so make sure you find a good photographer research them on the internet maybe you know one in your town but make sure its professional

006llgdkkgm_0-5-rgb_front how to master the tunnel technique just as i have mentioned previously with the over and the table command will come through dedication commitment routine and repetition
006llgdkkgm_1-5-rgb_front after watching this video series you are going to understand and have a better idea of what agility is and how to prepare your dog
006llgdkkgm_2-5-rgb_front i would suggest like i have mentioned be creative on your walks find a parking curb a picnic bench or a fallen log to practice over a sewer block a picnic table to practice the table and as far as the tunnel if you have any chairs in the home with an actual bed sheet you can practice that as a tunnel as well
006llgdkkgm_3-5-rgb_front by exposing your dogs to these things every day they are going to become a lot less spooked and afraid and in no time will be hitting all of the obstacles on one simple run through
006llgdkkgm_4-5-rgb_front as i mentioned with the tunnel it is best to start in small increments and do a little bit each day to ensure you do not spook your dog which will also get a better result when you begin them with agility tournaments
00cal635wno_0-5-rgb_front allyn christopher all right we are getting close
00cal635wno_1-5-rgb_front it is almost a completely brand new cleaner just some of the exterior accessories and we are going to be ready to pick some dirt up
00cal635wno_10-5-rgb_front it actually goes over here and just sits on and as you can tell by the fact that this is augered we are just going to spin it on
00cal635wno_11-5-rgb_front again older frame be careful because this motion of the spinning could snap it here then you are into a whole other repair that includes glues and expoxys you have going to buy on your own and also it is a nonsense
00cal635wno_12-5-rgb_front i am going to leave it just about a finger is length away from the top of the mast
00cal635wno_13-5-rgb_front when you actually put this back in the pool and adjust and install like you did when it was new you will go through the process of seeing whether it is a little too way your center of floatness is in the right position
00cal635wno_14-5-rgb_front but once it is on there it is nice and stiff and you are good to go that is your float head
00cal635wno_2-5-rgb_front all right
00cal635wno_3-5-rgb_front oh actually heavy leaves
00cal635wno_4-5-rgb_front it is what it is designed for
00cal635wno_5-5-rgb_front all right
00cal635wno_6-5-rgb_front what i am going to do is a new float head
00cal635wno_7-5-rgb_front new float head the old float head had water in it sometimes that they get all cracked
00cal635wno_8-5-rgb_front i always like the fact that they will get water in them and you will splash them here and squeeze and the water does not come out
00cal635wno_9-5-rgb_front i do not know how gets in and why it is not coming out but that is for other minds to decide
00dkfksyvnq_0-5-rgb_front adobe photoshop is a registered trademark of adobe systems inc and i am in no way affiliated with adobe
00dkfksyvnq_1-5-rgb_front ok guys
00dkfksyvnq_10-5-rgb_front so what you can do is actually drop your opacity down to fifty percent and your spread to about sixteen pixels
00dkfksyvnq_11_12_13-5-rgb_front not your spread i am sorry the size to about sixteen pixels and the spread at zero so as you can see here distance five opacity fifty spread zero size sixteen
00dkfksyvnq_14-5-rgb_front now you are going to hit ok
00dkfksyvnq_15-5-rgb_front i am going to go over here up to the top and you can see my piece of tape
00dkfksyvnq_16-5-rgb_front it is starting to actually look like tape now
00dkfksyvnq_17-5-rgb_front now what we are going to do is we are going to move on to the next clip and i am going to show you how to actually make little cuts into the tape to make it look even more realistic
00dkfksyvnq_2-5-rgb_front on this tutorial i am going to show you how to make a drop shadow on your tape to make it look a little more realistic
00dkfksyvnq_3-5-rgb_front so you want to make sure your tape one layer is selected as you can see right here
00dkfksyvnq_4-5-rgb_front it is selected
00dkfksyvnq_5-5-rgb_front you want to come down over here to your effects layer style effects tool and click
00dkfksyvnq_6-5-rgb_front now you can go either straight down to drop shadow or you can actually hit burning options
00dkfksyvnq_7-5-rgb_front i am just going to hit drop shadow
00dkfksyvnq_8-5-rgb_front as you can see it automatically brought me a drop shadow on my piece of tape
00dkfksyvnq_9-5-rgb_front for some people they would argue that that looks a little too much
00fc7czx1gm_0-5-rgb_front one of the main problems with illnesses in box turtles is going to be vitamin a deficiency
00fc7czx1gm_1-5-rgb_front this is the underlying cause of several different conditions that box turtles can get
00fc7czx1gm_10-5-rgb_front her eyes were the only real apparent illness at the time so that is what i was treating at the moment
00fc7czx1gm_11-5-rgb_front then when i started seeing the bubbles coming from her nose i realized there might be something more to it
00fc7czx1gm_12-5-rgb_front so after further research i found that vitamin a deficiency fit all of the symptoms that she had and i immediately began to treat her for that condition
00fc7czx1gm_13-5-rgb_front now a good source of vitamin a like i had mentioned before is cod liver oil
00fc7czx1gm_14-5-rgb_front added to her daily diet or at every feeding will prevent vitamin a deficiency
00fc7czx1gm_15_16-5-rgb_front now in her case i her with vitamin a i had to receive veterinary care for her she had to receive a shot of vitamin a and she also had a fungus growing in her mouth and down her throat which caused her to lose her appetite completely
00fc7czx1gm_17-5-rgb_front so that led to the malnourishment
00fc7czx1gm_18-5-rgb_front and the antibiotics were used to treat the fungus and then the vitamin a injections plus my care at home
00fc7czx1gm_19-5-rgb_front i had to force feed her for quite a while by sticking a tube down into her stomach with a mixture
00fc7czx1gm_2-5-rgb_front this turtle in particular i got her as a rescue
00fc7czx1gm_20-5-rgb_front which you can probably find on the internet some sort of force feeding recipe for any type of reptile that you may have
00fc7czx1gm_21-5-rgb_front now she is completely well again
00fc7czx1gm_22-5-rgb_front this is something that is this is the first time she is been healthy since i have had her
00fc7czx1gm_23-5-rgb_front and she looks wonderful now but just in case i always want to make sure i put the cod liver oil on her veggies
00fc7czx1gm_24-5-rgb_front that way i am sure to not have this issue again
00fc7czx1gm_3-5-rgb_front she had been in a pet store that was abandoned and she was left without food and water therefore she did not have access to enough vitamin a
00fc7czx1gm_4-5-rgb_front by the time i received her she was extremely dehydrated
00fc7czx1gm_5-5-rgb_front she was malnourished
00fc7czx1gm_6-5-rgb_front she was basically skin and bones
00fc7czx1gm_7-5-rgb_front her eyes were infected both of her eyes were infected and very pussy
00fc7czx1gm_8-5-rgb_front she has respiratory infection and she was just in horrible condition
00fc7czx1gm_9-5-rgb_front and so i treated her a long time by myself just her eyes
00t6xk82a7k_1-5-rgb_front in these clips we are going to talk about the proper way to remove and replace your vehicle is thermostat
00t6xk82a7k_10-5-rgb_front in order to remove the serpentine belt what we have to do is release this tension that is applied by the tensioner
00t6xk82a7k_11-5-rgb_front the tensioner is in a clockwise direction
00t6xk82a7k_12-5-rgb_front as you can see i have my double wrench here and you can see as i work it and let it go the belt gets tighter and looser
00t6xk82a7k_13-5-rgb_front so what i am going to do is take and put enough tension on it so i can slip the belt off of my alternator and let it relax back down
00t6xk82a7k_14-5-rgb_front once i have this guy out of the way i can take and remove my belt
00t6xk82a7k_15-5-rgb_front now if my completely off of the engine but out of the way enough that i can get at the tensioner is mounting bolts
00t6xk82a7k_16-5-rgb_front there is one here and there is one here on the bottom
00t6xk82a7k_17-5-rgb_front i got my drive crafts and ratchet with my mm socket
00t6xk82a7k_18-5-rgb_front we will take and slip it on the mounting bolt there and give it a pop to break it loose
00t6xk82a7k_2-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about removing the serpentine belt and the serpentine belt tensioner in order to gain access to our vehicle is thermostat
00t6xk82a7k_20-5-rgb_front you are going to go ahead and repeat the same procedure for the other mounting bolts if there are any present
00t6xk82a7k_3-5-rgb_front this yellow component right here is my thermostat housing
00t6xk82a7k_4-5-rgb_front it is got a small portion of pipe on it as you can see and goes down to the actual housing here
00t6xk82a7k_5-5-rgb_front it has three bolts that hold it down
00t6xk82a7k_6-5-rgb_front and unfortunately enough ford decided to bury one of them behind my serpentine belt tensioner
00t6xk82a7k_7-5-rgb_front on your particular vehicle you may not necessarily have to remove a serpentine belt tensioner
00t6xk82a7k_8-5-rgb_front however you may have to remove say an alternator or an compressor what i am going to do is go over with you the general removal procedures for a couple of these devices
00t6xk82a7k_9-5-rgb_front in order to remove the serpentine belt what you have to do is relax the tensioner
00ybzfwomz8_0-5-rgb_front hi the drink we are about to make is called pineapple cocktail
00ybzfwomz8_1-5-rgb_front let is go ahead and put some ice in a glass here and measure out one shot of light rum
00ybzfwomz8_10-5-rgb_front and if you like you can garnish that with a pineapple or you can just serve it up as is
00ybzfwomz8_11-5-rgb_front bottoms up
00ybzfwomz8_2-5-rgb_front with one ounce of light rum two ounces of pineapple juice and one shot of lemon juice one ounce and follow that up with a half a shot of grenadine which i have right here
00ybzfwomz8_3-5-rgb_front and we will go ahead and shake that up
00ybzfwomz8_4-5-rgb_front get everything mixed together
00ybzfwomz8_5-5-rgb_front there we go
00ybzfwomz8_6-5-rgb_front and we have got our glass here
00ybzfwomz8_7-5-rgb_front let is go ahead and pour it in
00ybzfwomz8_8-5-rgb_front the last thing we will do is just top it off with some club soda
00ybzfwomz8_9-5-rgb_front alright and we will add a straw
00kppw3aqus_0-3-rgb_front i just want to say a little bit about allergic reactions and aroma therapies
00kppw3aqus_1-3-rgb_front you know most people they just enjoy the aroma therapies and they they will not have any reaction
00kppw3aqus_10-3-rgb_front they are wonderful but you know use them use them a little sparingly when you have to
00kppw3aqus_11-3-rgb_front the other thing to know is if there is any if you are feeling disoriented or a little bit fuzzy headed or confused that could be a sign that you are getting a little bit high from the essential oil blends but not the right way
00kppw3aqus_12-3-rgb_front and so just kind of look for some of those signs and if you have any of them just stop using whatever it is
00kppw3aqus_13-3-rgb_front if it seems like it is still an agreeable formula for you to use use it in a smaller amount use it less frequently and you know use your best judgment and follow your intuition because aroma therapies they are very personal and you can kind of tell what is working for you and what is not
00kppw3aqus_2-3-rgb_front but one thing to bare in mind is everybody is different and the kinds of scents people like vary from one person to the next
00kppw3aqus_3-3-rgb_front it is just like getting a haircut everybody wants something a little bit different but there are certain common themes
00kppw3aqus_4-3-rgb_front so really something to look out for when you are making aroma therapies is headaches nausea rashes and even a kind of rash where maybe your whole maybe your skin is not totally broken out but your skin feels kind of a little bit dry or itchy
00kppw3aqus_5-3-rgb_front that might be an indication that you are either using the wrong aroma therapies or that you are using too much or that you are using them too frequently
00kppw3aqus_6-3-rgb_front for example if you are taking baths every night and you are putting you know essential oils into your bath every night that is probably too much
00kppw3aqus_7-3-rgb_front you may toxify your system by using too much essential oil
00kppw3aqus_8-3-rgb_front because again this is something that when it touches your skin it is going into your blood stream
00kppw3aqus_9-3-rgb_front so you know if you love bath salts maybe three nights a week is good maybe four nights a week at the most but you got to give yourself a little time to rest and to not have to interact with the aroma therapies
00m1mqff5zo_0-3-rgb_front alright now let is talk about taking messages
00m1mqff5zo_1-3-rgb_front and your whole job might be about taking messages or you might just simply answer the phone for another person and you will need to take a message for them
00m1mqff5zo_10-3-rgb_front i will make sure that he gets the message
00m1mqff5zo_11-3-rgb_front and then you have to make sure that that person gets the message
00m1mqff5zo_12-3-rgb_front it is very very important that business messages not get dropped through the cracks
00m1mqff5zo_13-3-rgb_front so take accurate information and pass the message on immediately not three days later but immediately after you record the message
00m1mqff5zo_2-3-rgb_front it is absolutely crucial that you get a certain amount of information from the person on the other end of the phone
00m1mqff5zo_3-3-rgb_front and the information must be accurate
00m1mqff5zo_4-3-rgb_front you need to have their name the business that they are calling from if that is applicable the telephone number and a brief message
00m1mqff5zo_5-3-rgb_front now i said it is crucial that this information be accurate
00m1mqff5zo_6-3-rgb_front well how do you make sure it is accurate
00m1mqff5zo_7-3-rgb_front you repeat it
00m1mqff5zo_8-3-rgb_front okay this is john smith from xyz corporation and your phone number is and you want to talk to bob about the planning meeting on friday
00m1mqff5zo_9-3-rgb_front okay great
00xgnw3m4-4_0-3-rgb_front hi this is yolanda vanveen from vanveenbulbs com
00xgnw3m4-4_1-3-rgb_front and in this segment we are going to learn about how to plant sunflowers
00xgnw3m4-4_10-3-rgb_front the easiest way that i found to grow seeds is to take the container and open it up
00xgnw3m4-4_11_12-3-rgb_front then take a napkin or a paper towel and put some seeds into there and once you have got them into the middle kind of spread them out just a bit because you do not want to be too crowded and then i double it up and i will wet that down and then put it into a plastic bag
00xgnw3m4-4_13-3-rgb_front and leave it in the house in a warm spot
00xgnw3m4-4_14-3-rgb_front so the best time to do this is april or may of every year
00xgnw3m4-4_15-3-rgb_front you can also grow a second crop of sunflowers into the summer
00xgnw3m4-4_16-3-rgb_front so you can start another crop of them in july and august as well
00xgnw3m4-4_17-3-rgb_front but the first crop i usually start in april may and i give it water put some water in it and leave it just in a drawer
00xgnw3m4-4_18-3-rgb_front and then i will check on it every couple days and eventually the little seed will start growing and you will see just a little sprout
00xgnw3m4-4_19-3-rgb_front and it is at that time i take the sprouts and i put them right into the ground
00xgnw3m4-4_2-3-rgb_front so there is different ways that you can buy your sunflowers
00xgnw3m4-4_20-3-rgb_front and make sure the green is out of the ground and the roots are covered and i just cover them up
00xgnw3m4-4_21-3-rgb_front and they will grow very quickly from there
00xgnw3m4-4_22-3-rgb_front you just put some seed starter mix in here and sprinkle just a few seeds in each one
00xgnw3m4-4_23-3-rgb_front and give it lots of water and make sure to mist it
00xgnw3m4-4_24-3-rgb_front do not just pour water on it the key is to mist the starter mist the seeds and they will start growing
00xgnw3m4-4_25-3-rgb_front and once they get a pretty good root base then i will turn around and plant them in the ground
00xgnw3m4-4_26-3-rgb_front either way i have had great success with sunflowers
00xgnw3m4-4_27-3-rgb_front i have put them right into the ground before and i did not even start them ahead of time and they have grown well
00xgnw3m4-4_28-3-rgb_front these came in from the neighbor is yard
00xgnw3m4-4_29-3-rgb_front the birds brought them or they just flew over here
00xgnw3m4-4_3-3-rgb_front a lot of times you buy them in containers already growing and when they are already growing you really do not have too much but turn around and transplant that pot right into the ground
00xgnw3m4-4_30-3-rgb_front either way they are so easy to grow and such a rewarding plant
00xgnw3m4-4_4-3-rgb_front so just make sure that it gets enough sun
00xgnw3m4-4_5-3-rgb_front that is the key it is got to have full hot sun
00xgnw3m4-4_6-3-rgb_front sunflowers will not do well in the shade
00xgnw3m4-4_7-3-rgb_front when you purchase a sunflower in a pot they are easy you just transplant them
00xgnw3m4-4_8-3-rgb_front you can leave them in the pot or you can put them right into the ground either way but make sure that you leave the dirt around the root so that they do not get too dried out
00xgnw3m4-4_9-3-rgb_front when you are growing sunflowers from seed there is a lot of easy tricks that you can do
01dnm-s8rni_0-3-rgb_front hi i am jeanette welker
01dnm-s8rni_1-3-rgb_front i am a family nurse practitioner practicing in eugene oregon at oregon optimal health and i can tell you about one of the funniest times that i came to work
01dnm-s8rni_2-3-rgb_front the very first job that i got as a nurse practitioner was with the university of new mexico in their maternity and infant care project
01dnm-s8rni_3-3-rgb_front doing that particular job we did not only prenatal care for pregnant women but we also were able to do wellness follow up visits for their babies and infants up to the age of about two years of age
01dnm-s8rni_4-3-rgb_front i arrived early in a rural part of new mexico to do cancer screening and opened up the doors and lo and behold there were two clients already waiting there for me
01dnm-s8rni_5-3-rgb_front they were bats attached to the walls
01dnm-s8rni_6-3-rgb_front i had to get brooms out and encourage them to go outward so that we could bring our real clients in and that was the start of a day of a batty start to a day
01g_nwgayaq_1-3-rgb_front today i would be talking about how to tack up a horse
01g_nwgayaq_10-3-rgb_front as you put the nose band on the nose band should be snugged
01g_nwgayaq_11-3-rgb_front as we put the throat latch on you still want to be able to fit about a fist right here
01g_nwgayaq_12-3-rgb_front it is important that you do not make this one too tight cause then when they go to flex it can cut off some circulation
01g_nwgayaq_2-3-rgb_front now that the bridle is on you want to make sure that it is fitted well
01g_nwgayaq_3-3-rgb_front you want to make sure that the bit is high enough that there is wrinkle in the corner of his mouth
01g_nwgayaq_4-3-rgb_front right now there is non
01g_nwgayaq_5-3-rgb_front so tighten that up
01g_nwgayaq_6-3-rgb_front so now you can see that there is wrinkles in the corner of his mouth and it always important to put the pieces in the keepers
01g_nwgayaq_7-3-rgb_front now adjusting the nose band you want to make sure that the nose band goes underneath the cheek pieces
01g_nwgayaq_8-3-rgb_front it is just a little higher of the bit but just underneath his cheek bone there
01g_nwgayaq_9-3-rgb_front so i am going to put that up a couple of holes once again tucking each piece under its keeper
01kr04fe7fw_0-3-rgb_front hi
01kr04fe7fw_2-3-rgb_front i am soaking my feet in a plain plastic basin with the epsom salt in bath temperature water
01kr04fe7fw_3-3-rgb_front you could also purchase basin that plug into the wall that have a warmer in them and vibrate and tingle your feet which also feels really really good to your feet
01kr04fe7fw_4-3-rgb_front you soak for about minutes although you want to stay longer because it feels so good
01kr04fe7fw_5-3-rgb_front but i have been here for about minutes and now i am going to take one of my feet out of the water and use the pumice stone on the heels and just scrap the dead skin of the heels
01kr04fe7fw_6-3-rgb_front because i have soaked and because i have used the epsom salt the pumice stone works really well removing the dead skin and makes the heels feel very very soft
01kr04fe7fw_7-3-rgb_front i will continue on doing this one sometimes you have dry skin and person has dry skin up in this area from shoes
01kr04fe7fw_8-3-rgb_front basically you could do the right foot and i will continue on with the other one
01j1uveqzte_0-3-rgb_front we are talking about the home office and how to be productive
01j1uveqzte_1-3-rgb_front so for me i have found that environment is very important
01j1uveqzte_10-3-rgb_front i got things done but i can tell you it was not nearly to the level where i am able to be productive now so i would highly recommend even if you do not have an entire room that you can stake out for yourself
01j1uveqzte_11-3-rgb_front i do think that is idea
01j1uveqzte_12-3-rgb_front even if you can not do that though make sure that there is a corner or an area of the house that is yours
01j1uveqzte_13-3-rgb_front that is your work station
01j1uveqzte_14-3-rgb_front that is where you go when you are working and that your family and your loved ones your children whoever might be a distraction know that when you are there working you are working and that is your work time and just kind of if you set those boundaries right from the start then it should be a lot easier for you down the road and when you sit there you will have that psychological trigger of oh this is my work station this is where i work
01j1uveqzte_15-3-rgb_front it just kind of helps you over time be a lot more productive
01j1uveqzte_2-3-rgb_front when i first started working remotely or from home i found that i just kind of would work wherever i could
01j1uveqzte_3-3-rgb_front i had a laptop
01j1uveqzte_4-3-rgb_front i was sitting on the couch with the tv on one day and maybe i would be sitting in my room writing typing while i am sitting on my bed another day and what i came to find out was that just really was not conducive for me being productive so what i did was i got a room all to myself
01j1uveqzte_5-3-rgb_front this is my home office
01j1uveqzte_6-3-rgb_front i designate it as my space
01j1uveqzte_7-3-rgb_front i decorated it the way i wanted to in a way that made me feel calm and allows me to think clearly
01j1uveqzte_8-3-rgb_front i think that environment is very important for productivity
01j1uveqzte_9-3-rgb_front looking back i do not even know how i got anything done sitting on the couch with people walking around talking to me interrupting me

01ucr6xrejw_1-5-rgb_front my name is brandon
01ucr6xrejw_10-5-rgb_front take the very end of the rope pass it to the front of the loop pull through
01ucr6xrejw_11-5-rgb_front when you pull the knot tight it should come out looking like an
01ucr6xrejw_12-5-rgb_front this called the figure knot
01ucr6xrejw_13-5-rgb_front what you are going to do next is retrace this knot to your harness tying yourself in
01ucr6xrejw_3-5-rgb_front the first step to getting on the wall is to tie in
01ucr6xrejw_4-5-rgb_front when you approach the wall look up separate the ropes and grab the rope closest the wall
01ucr6xrejw_5-5-rgb_front this is going to be the climber is rope
01ucr6xrejw_6-5-rgb_front next grab the very end of that rope in your right hand
01ucr6xrejw_7-5-rgb_front pull an arm is span of slack through
01ucr6xrejw_8-5-rgb_front next step make a pinch in the rope with the end of the rope on the right side and drop it from your right hand
01ucr6xrejw_9-5-rgb_front double check to make certain that the end of the rope is in the right side of the loop wrap the rope clock wise around the loop
025gakrciky_0_1-3-rgb_front how are you doing my name is lars eric robinson i am with larser arts all around i am a freelance illustrator
025gakrciky_10-3-rgb_front it should come straight off there is other cleaning mediums out there that you can look for too they have a powder form that should be able to take your paint right off
025gakrciky_11-3-rgb_front hope that explains to you what we go through as artists to try to get our paint off our clothes
025gakrciky_12-3-rgb_front thank you so much
025gakrciky_2-3-rgb_front today i am going to talk about something that is you probably want to know about if you are painting and you are working and you are having clothes and you do not want to get anything on it
025gakrciky_3-3-rgb_front as you can tell right here i have a paint stain right here on my pants
025gakrciky_4-3-rgb_front you take mineral spirits the same medium thinner that you are using for your oils
025gakrciky_5-3-rgb_front you dab it on both sides you put it on there
025gakrciky_6-3-rgb_front once you notice it dropped on there you let it soak
025gakrciky_7-3-rgb_front then maybe when you are done at the end of the day you could take this same stain that you have on there and you put your dish washing soap on both sides and rub it in
025gakrciky_8-3-rgb_front and then wash it just like a normal clothes
025gakrciky_9-3-rgb_front it should definitely be able to come out so just remember you use this paint thinner that you had that you were painting with and just dab it on there you can scrub it a little bit and then when you are done just wash it like a normal clothes
028cpyjmyak_1-8-rgb_front my name is leta koontz
028cpyjmyak_10-8-rgb_front to come out of the pose just release your fingers and release your foot
028cpyjmyak_2-8-rgb_front i am a yoga instructor at schoolhouse yoga located in pittsburgh pennsylvania
028cpyjmyak_4-8-rgb_front mermaid pose
028cpyjmyak_5-8-rgb_front from here you are going to bring your right knee in front of you
028cpyjmyak_6-8-rgb_front again keeping the belly drawn in you are going to reach back and take your left ankle
028cpyjmyak_7-8-rgb_front start to draw the heel of your left foot in towards your left hip
028cpyjmyak_8-8-rgb_front you can stay here for a breath or two to get a nice long quadricep
028cpyjmyak_9-8-rgb_front then you can bring the hand into the armpit or into the edge of the elbow bring your right hand back release your fingers and look forward
02cpakicrl4_1-8-rgb_front learning the cross body throw begins with grip the thumb is on the top and the fingers are on the bottom
02cpakicrl4_2-8-rgb_front you can extend your index finger out on the side when you release the outside edge the edge away from your hand should be up
02cpakicrl4_3-8-rgb_front this edge cuts into the air and gives the disc it is lift the arm and follow through point towards the target
02cpakicrl4_4-8-rgb_front this throw put right spin on the disc for a lefty all the right and left things are opposite
02cpakicrl4_5-8-rgb_front the legs make a line into the target when we release our right foot is forward this is probably the most common throw in the one that most of us start with
02cpakicrl4_6-8-rgb_front by throwing the cross body like slightly up hill sort of speak it slows the disc down and makes it easier to catch and do tricks
02cpakicrl4_7-8-rgb_front using a pass catch we can get set up for the cross body throw for the pass catch just step aside and as it is passing you grab it on the back side
02cpakicrl4_8-8-rgb_front i will cover it in detail in another clip this is a great throw when your playing close together
02lnullxds4_0-8-rgb_front color is relative
02lnullxds4_1-8-rgb_front and that is the one rule that you really need to remember
02lnullxds4_10-8-rgb_front but in a different ground this pink looks different
02lnullxds4_11-8-rgb_front that means that you have got an awful lot of color testing in front of you
02lnullxds4_12-8-rgb_front i am just going to show you again a dark pink here
02lnullxds4_13-8-rgb_front and again the same thing happens
02lnullxds4_14-8-rgb_front this is looking more purple
02lnullxds4_15-8-rgb_front this is looking very purple actually
02lnullxds4_16-8-rgb_front and this again looks more orange
02lnullxds4_17-8-rgb_front this is happens something to do a with the fact that the colors are mixed
02lnullxds4_18-8-rgb_front i mean the blue is straight out of the jar as is the red
02lnullxds4_19-8-rgb_front the pink i had to mix
02lnullxds4_2-8-rgb_front every time you change a color in a painting you change everything else that is happening around it
02lnullxds4_20-8-rgb_front now i mixed the pink with white
02lnullxds4_21-8-rgb_front you know got to get it lighter
02lnullxds4_22-8-rgb_front and i put in a little blue
02lnullxds4_23-8-rgb_front what happens is the red sucks up all the colors in the light spectrum except red
02lnullxds4_24-8-rgb_front then you have got this on top and it is going to respond more blue
02lnullxds4_25-8-rgb_front on the blue where every color but blue is being sucked up
02lnullxds4_26-8-rgb_front then this responds differently
02lnullxds4_27-8-rgb_front there is sort of no more blue so it becomes more on the orange side
02lnullxds4_28-8-rgb_front so weather it is a dark or a light color the fact that it is a mixed color when it is next to something different
02lnullxds4_29-8-rgb_front again i am going to move this down here
02lnullxds4_3-8-rgb_front this is just a very simple test
02lnullxds4_30-8-rgb_front that is the same color
02lnullxds4_31-8-rgb_front but you would not think it to look up here
02lnullxds4_32-8-rgb_front so that is the foot of the very basic idea behind color adjust position
02lnullxds4_4-8-rgb_front this color looks sort of like a blue pink
02lnullxds4_5-8-rgb_front this looks kind of like a orange corral pink
02lnullxds4_6-8-rgb_front these are in fact the same pink
02lnullxds4_7-8-rgb_front let me prove it
02lnullxds4_8-8-rgb_front the same pink
02lnullxds4_9-8-rgb_front i cut them off out off of the same stripe
02m-xcs3x30_0-3-rgb_front hi i am william richey i am the executive manager for american eagle security in springfield oregon
02m-xcs3x30_1-3-rgb_front the reason i became a security officer was to use it as a stepping stone to get into law enforcement
02m-xcs3x30_2-3-rgb_front a lot of people when they get out of high school or out of college or right out of the military want to work in law enforcement
02m-xcs3x30_3-3-rgb_front and security is a good stepping stone it gets them out onto the street it gets them some experience dealing with the public and seeing the type of crimes that happens and helps them with their career path moving towards law enforcement
02m-xcs3x30_4-3-rgb_front i myself ended up enjoying security so much that i ended up making it a career and never pursued the law enforcement aspect of it
02m-xcs3x30_5-3-rgb_front and i have been doing security now for about years and i have enjoyed every year of it
02m-xcs3x30_6-3-rgb_front and that is why i became a security officer
02qgtjljynm_0-8-rgb_front i am now going to pursue working on pam is bikini line
02qgtjljynm_1-8-rgb_front in many times incidences in my salon i have women that want all the hair off
02qgtjljynm_10-8-rgb_front but the nice thing about pam is that she has light skin
02qgtjljynm_11-8-rgb_front so this would work on a laser
02qgtjljynm_12-8-rgb_front but not at the best potential like a white skinned person and a dark dark haired person
02qgtjljynm_13-8-rgb_front so she wants electrology
02qgtjljynm_14-8-rgb_front she really believes in it
02qgtjljynm_15-8-rgb_front she is had great success with it and that is what we are going to do
02qgtjljynm_16-8-rgb_front so now we are just going to slide each one of these down this probe down each one of these follicles
02qgtjljynm_17-8-rgb_front and this hair is a little heavier
02qgtjljynm_18-8-rgb_front and this is they call terminal sexual hair
02qgtjljynm_19-8-rgb_front it is deeper and it is a little stronger
02qgtjljynm_2-8-rgb_front and when the hair is dark like i said before i am going to tell them i think and this is my opinion i think laser is going to be the better choice for you
02qgtjljynm_20-8-rgb_front as you can see if i was to hold up that hair that it is deeper than a lot of the other hairs in the body
02qgtjljynm_21-8-rgb_front if you measure on the probe how deep it is so that tells you just how deep your insertion should be
02qgtjljynm_3-8-rgb_front but when it is a woman that has sporadic hair on the side or here and there strays and some cleanup work i would advise electrology
02qgtjljynm_4-8-rgb_front and especially if that hair is light in color because energy of a laser is not going to work on lighter hair
02qgtjljynm_5-8-rgb_front it does not have the melanin for the laser to be attracted to it and cause the heat to go into the follicle and destroy the germitive cells
02qgtjljynm_6-8-rgb_front but when it comes to electrology each hair no matter what the color is it is going to work on
02qgtjljynm_7-8-rgb_front so in that fashion we are going to go in and we are going to look assess the area
02qgtjljynm_8-8-rgb_front pam is hair is not very dark
02qgtjljynm_9-8-rgb_front it really is kind of a dark blonde
02wrxawx-bo_1-8-rgb_front now i am going to show you how to make one of my favorite holiday punches
02wrxawx-bo_10-8-rgb_front and we are going to get our wooden spoon
02wrxawx-bo_11-8-rgb_front just mix all of the ingredients together
02wrxawx-bo_12-8-rgb_front so you can get acquainted with one another
02wrxawx-bo_13-8-rgb_front and we are going to take it over to our stove top where our sauce pan will be ready to go and on medium
02wrxawx-bo_14-8-rgb_front let is go over there
02wrxawx-bo_15-8-rgb_front so in the pan we are going to be heating our four cups of cranberry juice with the cloves the hint of nutmeg and the cinnamon sticks
02wrxawx-bo_16-8-rgb_front and we are going to add some honey
02wrxawx-bo_17-8-rgb_front we need to make sure that we stir until the honey as completely dissolved
02wrxawx-bo_18-8-rgb_front and of course the juice is nice and warm
02wrxawx-bo_19-8-rgb_front that should be enough
02wrxawx-bo_2-8-rgb_front this is called the spiced punch and it is very quick and easy to make
02wrxawx-bo_20-8-rgb_front but if you like honey feel free to add a little more
02wrxawx-bo_21-8-rgb_front now we are going to bring the punch over to our bowl
02wrxawx-bo_22-8-rgb_front make sure you do it very gently so you do not get burned
02wrxawx-bo_23-8-rgb_front the spiced punch serves six to eight people
02wrxawx-bo_24-8-rgb_front and typically it would be served in a mug or a teacup garnished with about two little sticks of cinnamon and that is it
02wrxawx-bo_25-8-rgb_front the spiced punch
02wrxawx-bo_3-8-rgb_front but so good
02wrxawx-bo_4-8-rgb_front you are going to need four cups of cranberry juice honey just for the taste a few sticks of cinnamon a pinch of nutmeg and about three to four cloves
02wrxawx-bo_5-8-rgb_front now i am going to bring over here my punch bowl to mix all the things in
02wrxawx-bo_6-8-rgb_front and you can start your stove top at about medium
02wrxawx-bo_7-8-rgb_front now i am going to mix the two cinnamon sticks with the four cups of cranberry juice
02wrxawx-bo_8-8-rgb_front like i said just a little hint of nutmeg and a few cloves
02wrxawx-bo_9-8-rgb_front like so
02afykvwx6m_0-8-rgb_front off season training for football outdoor conditioning
02afykvwx6m_1-8-rgb_front right now we are going to do another superset a combination of burpies and
02afykvwx6m_10-8-rgb_front jones is going to take it at full speed
02afykvwx6m_11-8-rgb_front we are working down and up
02afykvwx6m_12-8-rgb_front we are going to do ten and ten
02afykvwx6m_13-8-rgb_front he is going to do ten burpies
02afykvwx6m_14-8-rgb_front we are going to do five and five
02afykvwx6m_15-8-rgb_front we are going to do a combination of five burpies for ten
02afykvwx6m_16-8-rgb_front we want to repeat this for five sets
02afykvwx6m_17-8-rgb_front we will be doing five burpies and ten each set for a total of burpies and fifty
02afykvwx6m_18-8-rgb_front that is for our superset of burpies and
02afykvwx6m_19-8-rgb_front next we are going to work on some exercises single leg exercises that will help develop stability and agility
02afykvwx6m_2-8-rgb_front jones is going to demonstrate what a burpie is
02afykvwx6m_3-8-rgb_front can we take it slow real fast
02afykvwx6m_4-8-rgb_front we want to hit the ground and then jump back into a plank position lowered down for a and then we are going to spring forward and then get into a squat deep squat position and then we finish by ending up on top
02afykvwx6m_5-8-rgb_front then we are going to combine that with
02afykvwx6m_6-8-rgb_front can you show us some please
02afykvwx6m_7-8-rgb_front jones is showing us what we mean about
02afykvwx6m_8-8-rgb_front we are going to work full so that we are getting the hip flexors involved and when we come up on top we open up the chest open up the shoulders and push the chest out
02afykvwx6m_9-8-rgb_front now we are going to work a combination of it
02gzhnpz1w4_0-8-rgb_front now i am going to demonstrate the double figure of eight hitch loop however you want to look at it
02gzhnpz1w4_1-8-rgb_front its really just a constrictor knot is all it is
02gzhnpz1w4_10-8-rgb_front now what i am going to do is since my overhand loop my initial loop i created my working end
02gzhnpz1w4_11-8-rgb_front bring it back around and create another loop here another just overhand loop
02gzhnpz1w4_12-8-rgb_front and then i am going to take my standing end that i have here and we will bring it back around as well
02gzhnpz1w4_13-8-rgb_front and we will create another overhand loop as well on the other side
02gzhnpz1w4_14-8-rgb_front now how this is going to be used is i am going to take my block of wood here and i am going to pick both of these pieces up and i am going to slide my wood through
02gzhnpz1w4_15-8-rgb_front and i am just going to pull them through like so
02gzhnpz1w4_16-8-rgb_front and constrict these knots around this piece of wood
02gzhnpz1w4_17-8-rgb_front now i will have to work it just a little bit because there you go pull
02gzhnpz1w4_18-8-rgb_front my square piece of wood is going to create problems but if this was a round piece like a broomstick or something this would actually tighten up a lot tighter
02gzhnpz1w4_19-8-rgb_front now as you can see here this is how your figure of eight loop should look
02gzhnpz1w4_2-8-rgb_front it s used to tie around something you know if you want to
02gzhnpz1w4_20-8-rgb_front kind of weaving around you know weaving around through and of itself
02gzhnpz1w4_21-8-rgb_front create this nice constrictor type knot
02gzhnpz1w4_3-8-rgb_front it s kind of like a decorative or an ornamental knot
02gzhnpz1w4_4-8-rgb_front so if you look down here you can see i have got my line that i am going to use
02gzhnpz1w4_5-8-rgb_front and what i am going to do is i am going to pull a little bit more out because i am going to need a lot of it
02gzhnpz1w4_6-8-rgb_front this is going to be my working end over here
02gzhnpz1w4_7-8-rgb_front i am just going to loop just a nice overhand loop over here on my working end
02gzhnpz1w4_8-8-rgb_front i am going to bring over here and i am going to create an underhand loop not like that but like that
02gzhnpz1w4_9-8-rgb_front so that they are kind of making this nice figure of eight as it comes around
02yxvi1vmpi_0-8-rgb_front hello
02yxvi1vmpi_10-8-rgb_front but if they have been painted in the last or years you probably just can use an electric one
02yxvi1vmpi_11-8-rgb_front once you have got that pressure washed then you want to go ahead and dust that all down do your caulking do your spackling and do all of your sanding
02yxvi1vmpi_12-8-rgb_front then once you have got that basic crepe work done then you are going to be ready to start priming
02yxvi1vmpi_13-8-rgb_front once we have all of that preparation done we will talk a little bit about the types of paints we are going to want to choose and how to pour that paint up
02yxvi1vmpi_14-8-rgb_front once we have gone over that then we are going to actually show how to apply this paint both on the interior eaves and the fascia
02yxvi1vmpi_15-8-rgb_front then when we are done we will talk a little bit how to clean everything up and how to maintain this work throughout the year to have a long lasting paint job that will really beautify your house
02yxvi1vmpi_16-8-rgb_front so when you get done with this series today you are going to know everything you need to know for painting the exterior eaves on your house
02yxvi1vmpi_2-8-rgb_front now we would like to talk in this series about painting the exterior eaves on your house
02yxvi1vmpi_3-8-rgb_front now whenever you are painting exterior eaves a couple things you want to look at
02yxvi1vmpi_4-8-rgb_front first of all make sure you wear a hat to kind of keep the sun off of your head and your face and some kind of sunglass
02yxvi1vmpi_5-8-rgb_front now the sunglasses do things
02yxvi1vmpi_6-8-rgb_front they are going to protect any chips or paint from falling in your eyes and they are going to keep that glare out of your face because usually you are painting some kind of white or pastel because of the heavy heavy reflection
02yxvi1vmpi_7-8-rgb_front now when you are painting the eaves of your house a few things you need to consider
02yxvi1vmpi_8-8-rgb_front first of all how bad do they look
02yxvi1vmpi_9-8-rgb_front if they are peeling really really bad then you are going to want to get a really strong pressure washer on that like a gas powered one
032pdxai5ge_1-8-rgb_front it is very important that you hold your weapon correctly
032pdxai5ge_10-8-rgb_front otherwise to hold it includes holding it deep in the hand a little lower depending on what your goals are
032pdxai5ge_11-8-rgb_front again watch carefully
032pdxai5ge_12-8-rgb_front i am holding it in the fingers basic position and depending on what i do it changes its position in my hand and that is key
032pdxai5ge_13-8-rgb_front it is not locked into place
032pdxai5ge_14-8-rgb_front the fingers manipulate the weapon
032pdxai5ge_15-8-rgb_front i can make thrusts
032pdxai5ge_16-8-rgb_front i can make cuts
032pdxai5ge_17-8-rgb_front i can make parries like so
032pdxai5ge_2-8-rgb_front there are multiple ways to hold your sabre correctly
032pdxai5ge_3-8-rgb_front the very basic way we start with the thumb opposite of curl on the guard about half an inch or so
032pdxai5ge_4-8-rgb_front the index finger opposite the thumb the other fingers curl around like so i will show you without the glove on
032pdxai5ge_5-8-rgb_front hold it right on the fingers
032pdxai5ge_6-8-rgb_front notice that my hands are not split open like so just here
032pdxai5ge_7-8-rgb_front this allows me to make cuts
032pdxai5ge_8-8-rgb_front i can make thrusts
032pdxai5ge_9-8-rgb_front i can change the position of the weapon in my hand depending on what i am doing
034pv2rsk8e_0-8-rgb_front hamstring curls in a quad prone position
034pv2rsk8e_1-8-rgb_front we are going to put the weight behind our knee
034pv2rsk8e_10-8-rgb_front leave the ankle the foot nice and soft do not excessively point or flex
034pv2rsk8e_11-8-rgb_front it is not going to put any more workload in there
034pv2rsk8e_12-8-rgb_front you have already got resistance to the movement you have got position of the movement
034pv2rsk8e_13-8-rgb_front nice slow and controlled up two down two
034pv2rsk8e_14-8-rgb_front working within ten to fifteen reps three sets
034pv2rsk8e_2-8-rgb_front make sure you have got a weight that you are going to be able to control and keep in there
034pv2rsk8e_3-8-rgb_front some people like the you can get balls medicine balls little weighted balls to put in there as well but this will work just fine with our hands underneath our shoulders
034pv2rsk8e_4-8-rgb_front knees square with the hips
034pv2rsk8e_5-8-rgb_front and we are going to contract exhale and inhale release
034pv2rsk8e_6-8-rgb_front it is not necessary to come all the way back down because then i lose neutral posture
034pv2rsk8e_7-8-rgb_front you want to maintain neutral posture this is kind of a half plank
034pv2rsk8e_8-8-rgb_front so we exhale we contract we do not want to go any higher than the hip after that we are involving the low back and the exercise is over
034pv2rsk8e_9-8-rgb_front primary focus remember is hamstring passes into the glut
03513v6_5tu_0-8-rgb_front choosing a saddle can be not only a difficult decision but one that requires a lot of time and patience in shopping
03513v6_5tu_1-8-rgb_front it helps if we start out understanding what we are buying and what we might expect to pay
03513v6_5tu_10-8-rgb_front we move on up to a nice barrel saddle of a name brand that is going to be better probably upwards of eight hundred dollars
03513v6_5tu_11-8-rgb_front this saddle in its original show condition could bring it up to near a thousand
03513v6_5tu_12-8-rgb_front as we move on forward some of these more showy saddles as well as a really good functional cutting saddle you can go with name brands that will take you as high as three thousand and upward i have seen them as high as six thousand
03513v6_5tu_13-8-rgb_front so you can see you have got a wide variety of choices and you are going to have to decide within your budget what is your best option
03513v6_5tu_2-8-rgb_front i usually coach my clients in trying to find the very best used saddle possible
03513v6_5tu_3-8-rgb_front if they are in fact in a bit of a budgeted plan
03513v6_5tu_4-8-rgb_front if we buy a brand new saddle one we have to break it in and sometimes it is fun to have that happen before we get it
03513v6_5tu_5-8-rgb_front but it is also going to be very pricey and it may become even more pricey as we look at the time that we have to spend shopping
03513v6_5tu_6-8-rgb_front we want to start out with thinking about a synthetic saddle although not my very favorite it does fall in the more budgeted category
03513v6_5tu_7-8-rgb_front we will talk about the merits of the synthetic versus leather down the road
03513v6_5tu_8-8-rgb_front but these saddles can be found even brand new for as low as two hundred fifty to three hundred dollars
03513v6_5tu_9-8-rgb_front as i move into my youth saddles a brand new saddle of this type might be about three hundred and fifty dollars to four hundred dollars
038ve9jsu9i_0-8-rgb_front here is some tools and supplies that you need to maintain your saxophone
038ve9jsu9i_1-8-rgb_front first off i am going to start off with a little baby powder
038ve9jsu9i_2-8-rgb_front we will use a dollar bill in conjunction with the baby powder
038ve9jsu9i_3-8-rgb_front we have got a little bit of soap here some contact cement as you can get at any hardware store key oil we also have some thread locker
038ve9jsu9i_4-8-rgb_front i like the blue because it is removable
038ve9jsu9i_5-8-rgb_front we have cork grease here which is a necessity we have a little cleaning brush a regular old paintbrush a small flathead screwdriver a large flathead screwdriver or a phillips head screwdriver you might need depending on what brand of saxophone you have
038ve9jsu9i_6-8-rgb_front some pliers some four ought steel wool some round nosed pliers a cleaning snake as well as a lacquer cloth
038ve9jsu9i_7-8-rgb_front and those are the tools and supplies needed for saxophone maintenance
03ezcosp2pc_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about penalty kicks
03ezcosp2pc_1-8-rgb_front in indoor soccer there are two types of penalty kicks
03ezcosp2pc_10-8-rgb_front the ball is placed at the penalty kick dot that is on the field a little bit in front of the penalty box
03ezcosp2pc_11-8-rgb_front at that point the keeper must stay on the goal line the official will blow his whistle and once the ball is touched the keeper is allowed to move from the line to save the ball
03ezcosp2pc_12-8-rgb_front it is a very short shot so usually it is taken with some sort of accuracy or power
03ezcosp2pc_13-8-rgb_front once the ball is kicked if the ball hits the wall but does not touch another person then the person kicking the penalty kick is not allowed to touch the ball it must touch someone else before hand
03ezcosp2pc_14-8-rgb_front if it does go off the keeper then the player is allowed to then try to get the rebound into the goal
03ezcosp2pc_15-8-rgb_front but once it is touched or once the ball is kicked towards the goal everybody else is allowed to enter the play of field
03ezcosp2pc_2-8-rgb_front what i am going to tell you about is the run up pad
03ezcosp2pc_3-8-rgb_front now basically this is very different than the outdoor version of a pk
03ezcosp2pc_4-8-rgb_front this is when a flagrant foul usually a blue card style foul is committed and there was possibly an offensive chance for a goal
03ezcosp2pc_5-8-rgb_front so the referee will pull all the players back behind the red line and the person who gets awarded the kick gets the ball started at the red line and the goal keeper has to start with his heels on the goal line and once the referee blows his whistle those two can come out and then it is basically one v one
03ezcosp2pc_6-8-rgb_front when the shot is taken if it is missed the play is dead and i believe the team that was awarded the kick automatically gets a free kick after the pk
03ezcosp2pc_7-8-rgb_front the other pk is just one of your standard penalty kicks where everybody is placed outside the red line
03ezcosp2pc_8-8-rgb_front you get one of these kicks when a penalty or a foul occurs inside the goalie box
03ezcosp2pc_9-8-rgb_front again it is a smaller goalie box so these are a little bit rarer than the one v one penalty kicks
03sgrpijksw_0-8-rgb_front o k
03sgrpijksw_1-8-rgb_front we have our gloves on
03sgrpijksw_10-8-rgb_front we are not doing this randomly this is very clear and very precise about which pores we are cleaning out
03sgrpijksw_11-8-rgb_front so we will go ahead and get started
03sgrpijksw_12-8-rgb_front everything is moving nicely
03sgrpijksw_13-8-rgb_front the thing about an acne facial is you never want to force anything from the skin
03sgrpijksw_14-8-rgb_front you want it all to come easily because the less irritated that the skin is the better
03sgrpijksw_2-8-rgb_front and we are going to cover the eyes again
03sgrpijksw_3-8-rgb_front a little bit more water
03sgrpijksw_4-8-rgb_front you want to cover the eyes for the protection of the light
03sgrpijksw_5-8-rgb_front so there we are stay away turn the light bright light
03sgrpijksw_6-8-rgb_front grab some tissue
03sgrpijksw_7-8-rgb_front and you want to use tissue just a little more protection so that you are not irritating the skin as much
03sgrpijksw_8-8-rgb_front move the light over
03sgrpijksw_9-8-rgb_front this is diopter scope so the magnifying glass is really gonna help us get into every single pore
03vktv6bl7c_0-8-rgb_front alright the last thing you want to take a look at is context
03vktv6bl7c_1-8-rgb_front and when i am talking about context i am talking about the actual space that you are going to speak in
03vktv6bl7c_2-8-rgb_front first of all how big is your audience
03vktv6bl7c_3-8-rgb_front are you going to be speaking to twenty people
03vktv6bl7c_4-8-rgb_front are you going to be speaking to five hundred people
03vktv6bl7c_5-8-rgb_front the topic that you choose and the level of intimacy in which you present it will vary dramatically for twelve or twenty people versus five hundred people
03vktv6bl7c_6-8-rgb_front you also need to take a look at the time of day that you are giving your speech
03vktv6bl7c_7-8-rgb_front if you are doing the speech right before lunch you might not want to do a speech about delicious food
03vktv6bl7c_8-8-rgb_front because your audience might not be able to concentrate because they are so hungry that they want to go get some delicious food
03vktv6bl7c_9-8-rgb_front or you might not want to do something that might be boring to them because they are so hungry they have got that internal noise going on and they are not listening to anything you say because they are hungry
03wue9zzqy4_0-8-rgb_front alright now that you are good and inspired
03wue9zzqy4_1-8-rgb_front ready to get designing itching to draw
03wue9zzqy4_10-8-rgb_front this is one of mine from awhile back
03wue9zzqy4_11-8-rgb_front this is my design
03wue9zzqy4_12-8-rgb_front this is the basic figure
03wue9zzqy4_13-8-rgb_front it is a skinny stretched out version of a human
03wue9zzqy4_14-8-rgb_front it is very important before you start designing any collection and every collection to have a stable of these croquis where you can just have them in a sketch pad and then you can just draw and sketch little designs on each one
03wue9zzqy4_15-8-rgb_front you do not want to have to spend your whole time doing the figuring getting it right which is why we are going to work on that right now
03wue9zzqy4_16-8-rgb_front and i will show you how to have a perfect figure in which to design your designs upon
03wue9zzqy4_2-8-rgb_front you got ideas circling in your head
03wue9zzqy4_3-8-rgb_front the first thing you need to do is have a croquis which is the basic figure to design upon
03wue9zzqy4_4-8-rgb_front it comes from the french word to sketch
03wue9zzqy4_5-8-rgb_front so i am sure you have probably never heard it
03wue9zzqy4_6-8-rgb_front if you have more power to you cause i had not
03wue9zzqy4_7-8-rgb_front this is the word
03wue9zzqy4_8-8-rgb_front visual
03wue9zzqy4_9-8-rgb_front and the basic figure when it is finished without color is going to look like this
03jabw2mkkk_0-8-rgb_front hi i am jay french at jayfrenchstudios com and i am going to show you how to draw clasped hands
03jabw2mkkk_1-8-rgb_front okay to draw clasped hands of course there are many angles you can do this from we are going to do it from pretty much the forward angle like this so what you have is i am going to draw the back of the hands
03jabw2mkkk_10-8-rgb_front and that is how to do the clasped hand from that angle until you see just the hint of the pinkie finger there
03jabw2mkkk_11-8-rgb_front then show your knuckle line from there you can add shading
03jabw2mkkk_12-8-rgb_front fingernails
03jabw2mkkk_13-8-rgb_front and you have the front view of clasped hands
03jabw2mkkk_14-8-rgb_front and that is one way to draw clasped hands
03jabw2mkkk_15-8-rgb_front remember to look for photo sources as your best bet
03jabw2mkkk_2-8-rgb_front we have your basic wedge of a hand give the impression of that but and i have done them too far apart so we want them clasped tight so let is do this
03jabw2mkkk_3-8-rgb_front start with your thumbs and draw the thumb that is going to go over the top first
03jabw2mkkk_4-8-rgb_front and one underneath second and from here you would think you would just be drawing something like this
03jabw2mkkk_5-8-rgb_front but it does not work that way because they overlap so draw your top finger again and it is going to be the same hand if you clasp your own fingers you will notice this
03jabw2mkkk_6-8-rgb_front it is going to be the same hand that has the thumb on top
03jabw2mkkk_7-8-rgb_front it is your top finger in there
03jabw2mkkk_8-8-rgb_front now you have a smaller because it is half covered by the other hand ring finger or index finger from that hand
03jabw2mkkk_9-8-rgb_front and the same thing is happening here it is half covered until it comes out here
03lzv6ozjhe_1-8-rgb_front yep we are going to deep fry this and we are going to have a breading on it that is just going to taste great
03lzv6ozjhe_10-8-rgb_front here we go alright so we would finish this up up here
03lzv6ozjhe_11-8-rgb_front i will these into the deep fryer and see how long it take to get them fry
03lzv6ozjhe_12-8-rgb_front clean off my fingers
03lzv6ozjhe_13-8-rgb_front okay we are goign to put these into the basket here
03lzv6ozjhe_14-8-rgb_front next segment we are going to do we are going to do something very interesting we are going to do some oysters
03lzv6ozjhe_15-8-rgb_front so when we come with this we see how many minutes it took to cook it and when it is golden brown it is done and then we would start on the oysters for you
03lzv6ozjhe_16-8-rgb_front okay i think these are ready now they have been in here for minutes we had the temperature up about and it depends on your taste if you like them a little bit darker then you could leave them a little longer but really watch them
03lzv6ozjhe_17-8-rgb_front cause once they start to get really brown they go fast
03lzv6ozjhe_18-8-rgb_front alright here you go simple easy delicious deep fried calamari
03lzv6ozjhe_19-8-rgb_front find your you special sauce and go dipping go eat it
03lzv6ozjhe_20-8-rgb_front the next thing you see from us the next segment would be oysters deep fried in breading
03lzv6ozjhe_2_3-8-rgb_front i will show you how to do it first off this is calamari that has been cut we had it cut first and we are going to go ahead and use these
03lzv6ozjhe_4-8-rgb_front i did not drain them very well i am going to get a paper towel and get them a little dryer in there
03lzv6ozjhe_5-8-rgb_front so our breading has salt pepper a little bit of garlic and then we put a little bit of italian seasoning so it gives it that extra kick
03lzv6ozjhe_6-8-rgb_front you could put anything you want into it it could be something hot and spicy it is jsut whatever your taste is
03lzv6ozjhe_7-8-rgb_front okay so we are just going to throw some in here and i am going to do this by hand instead of trying to use the utensils my kitchen my food my fingers
03lzv6ozjhe_8-8-rgb_front so i am going to put that like that this is flour and i threw a little bit of the pepper and salt in there and this is our breading this is a great dry batter it is just bread crumbs and breading that has just been made especially for this type of thing
03lzv6ozjhe_9-8-rgb_front we are going to put it right there and then we are going ot do this one and this is just eggs this is just eggs right there just beat up to make it sticky
03pzaot7rpm_0-8-rgb_front to continuing with the energy of virabhadrasana ii or hero pose when you inhale lift up through the crown
03pzaot7rpm_1-8-rgb_front you might imagine that your best friend is palm is right on the crown of your head and you are just lifting up to touch
03pzaot7rpm_2-8-rgb_front that is going to accentuate a lengthening of the whole spine but particularly in the cervical spine in the neck
03pzaot7rpm_3-8-rgb_front so everytime you inhale think about lifting up through the crown of the head and then as you exhale stretch the arms more
03pzaot7rpm_4-8-rgb_front reach those arms out remember to keep them on the same plane
03pzaot7rpm_5-8-rgb_front and once again turning the chin along the horizon to look out over your longest right fingertip
03pzaot7rpm_6-8-rgb_front inhaling lengthening exhaling sitting down a little bit more and stretching out through the fingertips
03pzaot7rpm_7-8-rgb_front stretching in all directions and breathing
03pzaot7rpm_8-8-rgb_front you can always check that back hand before you come over to check the forward hand to make sure that they are on the same plane
03w0fj9vlpo_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to make a polymer clay bowl
03w0fj9vlpo_10-8-rgb_front you are going to mold them down or pull some out but you are going to try to make it so that even
03w0fj9vlpo_11-8-rgb_front what we are making is a flower shaped cane and in order to do that we need to have a nice flower center and it looks really pretty if the center is a swirl
03w0fj9vlpo_12-8-rgb_front so now what we are going to do we are going to maybe take a rolling pin do an extra little roll we are going to roll this lengthwise
03w0fj9vlpo_13-8-rgb_front you want to make sure you have that first on in pretty tight
03w0fj9vlpo_14-8-rgb_front then you can bring it in a little and roll it but you want to press too hard
03w0fj9vlpo_15-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that its a nice even log but you want to smush it too much or stretch it too much because we are trying to keep that swirl shape that we made
03w0fj9vlpo_2-8-rgb_front in this next step we are going to create the canes to decorate our polymer bowl
03w0fj9vlpo_3-8-rgb_front so what we are going to do we are going to take two contrasting colors
03w0fj9vlpo_4-8-rgb_front i am going to use black and white
03w0fj9vlpo_5-8-rgb_front there is nothing more contrasting than that
03w0fj9vlpo_6-8-rgb_front and we are going to roll our black soften it up and then we are going to roll our white soften it up
03w0fj9vlpo_7-8-rgb_front we are going to roll our white piece and then we are going to do the same thing to our black piece
03w0fj9vlpo_8-8-rgb_front so basically we are going to get two flat pieces of contrasting color and it have to be perfectly shaped
03w0fj9vlpo_9-8-rgb_front and you are going to place one on top of the other and then you are going to try to remove any edges
03xd5bhcg94_0-8-rgb_front in doing side lying leg work you want to make sure that your entire body is stacked so that the hips are stacked one on the top of each other and you are not curled back or rolling forward
03xd5bhcg94_1-8-rgb_front the legs are stacked
03xd5bhcg94_10-8-rgb_front point down we are working the back
03xd5bhcg94_11-8-rgb_front so we are going to take a nice inhale and float the leg up
03xd5bhcg94_12-8-rgb_front exhale
03xd5bhcg94_13-8-rgb_front we are going to flex the foot
03xd5bhcg94_14-8-rgb_front pull the band and squeeze that inner thigh to bring the leg down
03xd5bhcg94_15-8-rgb_front point the toe down
03xd5bhcg94_16-8-rgb_front inhale
03xd5bhcg94_17-8-rgb_front up
03xd5bhcg94_18-8-rgb_front exhale
03xd5bhcg94_19-8-rgb_front flex and squeeze down
03xd5bhcg94_2-8-rgb_front the abs are pulled in
03xd5bhcg94_20-8-rgb_front point
03xd5bhcg94_21-8-rgb_front down
03xd5bhcg94_22-8-rgb_front inhale
03xd5bhcg94_23-8-rgb_front up
03xd5bhcg94_24-8-rgb_front exhale
03xd5bhcg94_25-8-rgb_front flex and squeeze down
03xd5bhcg94_3-8-rgb_front the ribcage is pulled in
03xd5bhcg94_4-8-rgb_front and you make a little pillow for your head with your elbow bent so that the head is fairly in line with the spine
03xd5bhcg94_5-8-rgb_front whenever you are doing legwork and you find yourself rolling to one side or the other try and straighten yourself out by engaging your abs
03xd5bhcg94_6-8-rgb_front so in this exercise we have the band around our foot covering the toes
03xd5bhcg94_7-8-rgb_front we are going to point the toe down
03xd5bhcg94_8-8-rgb_front and the reason we do that is that we want to work the back of the leg as opposed to the quadriceps
03xd5bhcg94_9-8-rgb_front if we point up we will be working this muscle
04-j8jucixg_0-8-rgb_front hi this is john stewart and this is how to raise the tent when setting up your tent
04-j8jucixg_1-8-rgb_front once you have got your poles inserted into the tent you can then raise up your tent
04-j8jucixg_10-8-rgb_front yes it can get frustrating but just take your time and it will go up nice and smoothly
04-j8jucixg_11-8-rgb_front and if you do have that friend grab him and they can help you out
04-j8jucixg_12-8-rgb_front and this is how to raise the tent
04-j8jucixg_2-8-rgb_front once you have got the poles crisscrossed at the center most of the time they are tied together to where they are standing and you do not have to hold them any longer you can then go into raising the tent
04-j8jucixg_3-8-rgb_front the tent is going to have two things to put it through you can either have the poles that have sleeves that velcro over the pole or you will have clips
04-j8jucixg_4-8-rgb_front both of them are very fast and efficient to set up
04-j8jucixg_5-8-rgb_front the clips seem to be a little bit sturdier
04-j8jucixg_6-8-rgb_front you just go along the pole and clip them one by one until you get them all clipped
04-j8jucixg_7-8-rgb_front once you have got them clipped the tent should be stood upright
04-j8jucixg_8-8-rgb_front and then you can go into staking out your tent
04-j8jucixg_9-8-rgb_front one thing to remember is that setting up a tent you can do this with one person
04dtdcu2kfg_0-5-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson
04dtdcu2kfg_1-5-rgb_front right now we are talking about the defense
04dtdcu2kfg_10-5-rgb_front what if my guy is still standing out there
04dtdcu2kfg_11-5-rgb_front well right now he is the farthest person away to getting the ball we are not really concerned about that
04dtdcu2kfg_12-5-rgb_front so what we want this defender to do is to drop all the way in fact we want him underneath the basket splitting his body should be splitting the middle of the floor even over a little bit
04dtdcu2kfg_13-5-rgb_front because what is going to happen is if this guy beats his man on the drive the only person back to help is this guy right here on defense and he is going to have to come out and try to either take a charge or stop this guy is drive
04dtdcu2kfg_14-5-rgb_front now you say but what about my man on the other side
04dtdcu2kfg_15-5-rgb_front well sometimes you get beat on that with the simple fact that if he has to close up here on the drive and his man comes in then this guy could dish off
04dtdcu2kfg_16-5-rgb_front you have just got to be a good enough defender that you could come out and play defense here and get back on here
04dtdcu2kfg_17-5-rgb_front but the main thing is we want to be in help side deep here and even if this guy skips the ball back you are going to be able to recover
04dtdcu2kfg_18-5-rgb_front so make sure when the ball is opposite your man that you get all the way into the half court
04dtdcu2kfg_19-5-rgb_front you see how he is dropped low enough too that he could see ball and his man when he is looking up the court
04dtdcu2kfg_2-5-rgb_front we are talking about the positioning of our defensive man as the ball moves around the perimeter
04dtdcu2kfg_20-5-rgb_front that is very very important to know where the ball and your man is in the defense
04dtdcu2kfg_3-5-rgb_front obviously when they have the ball we are on the ball with our defense
04dtdcu2kfg_4-5-rgb_front then as the ball moves one pass away we changed into deny defense
04dtdcu2kfg_5-5-rgb_front then as the ball moved to the top we talked about being in help side
04dtdcu2kfg_6-5-rgb_front the main thing is we want this guy to pointing to the ball and his man
04dtdcu2kfg_7-5-rgb_front what we want to talk about now is a little bit different style of help side
04dtdcu2kfg_8-5-rgb_front that is when the ball actually swings all the way to the opposite side away from the side of your man
04dtdcu2kfg_9-5-rgb_front a lot of people are concerned what happens to my guy
04vkildulsm_0-8-rgb_front if you want to go to vegas and make some money at the crap table
04vkildulsm_1-8-rgb_front my name is dean hale and i am going to teach you how to win at craps
04vkildulsm_10-8-rgb_front so that is going to give you a better chance to hedge your bet
04vkildulsm_11-8-rgb_front what you are going to want to do is eventually have money on three different numbers
04vkildulsm_12-8-rgb_front this takes down the casino advantage to it is lowest point
04vkildulsm_13-8-rgb_front that is the easiest way to try to win some money at craps is to minimize the casino is advantage
04vkildulsm_14-8-rgb_front so pass line if they do not hit their seven eleven initially try to get it on the come out line your money on two different numbers so you can minimize the casino is advantage
04vkildulsm_15-8-rgb_front my name is dean hale and i have just given you the best advice you can get about winning at craps
04vkildulsm_2-8-rgb_front craps is a game where if you roll as the shooter comes out and shoots and he rolls a seven or eleven you win
04vkildulsm_3-8-rgb_front but there is also other ways to win at craps
04vkildulsm_4-8-rgb_front there is a pass line and if you put the money on the pass line and the shooter rolls a seven or an eleven you win automatically
04vkildulsm_5-8-rgb_front unfortunately if they roll two three or twelve you lose
04vkildulsm_6-8-rgb_front now what you are going to want to do is the safest way to hedge your bet in craps is to try to have your money on three different numbers
04vkildulsm_7-8-rgb_front so what you are going to do is you are going to put money down on the pass line and if they roll a seven or eleven great you win
04vkildulsm_8-8-rgb_front take the money off and you can bet again
04vkildulsm_9-8-rgb_front if they do not and they hit their point or say they roll an eight and that is their point you want to put some money on the come out line
04hnjlkhh2g_0-5-rgb_front now i will show you how to use a pastry bag
04hnjlkhh2g_1-5-rgb_front first you want to hold the pastry bag in your hand like this and with your thumb and your finger gather up the excess bag on the top
04hnjlkhh2g_10-5-rgb_front we are just going to use a star tip and make little stars for our border
04hnjlkhh2g_11-5-rgb_front and how you do that is you squeeze holding the tip just slightly above the cake
04hnjlkhh2g_12-5-rgb_front you are not touching the cake you are not pushing the tip into the cake
04hnjlkhh2g_13-5-rgb_front you are holding it just a tiny bit above maybe an eighth of an inch above the cake and squeezing
04hnjlkhh2g_14-5-rgb_front and then before you lift the tip away you want to release pressure
04hnjlkhh2g_15-5-rgb_front now if you continue with pressure while you are lifting you are going to end up with a big tip
04hnjlkhh2g_16-5-rgb_front okay let me show you that again nice and close up
04hnjlkhh2g_17-5-rgb_front first i am going to clean off the tip there
04hnjlkhh2g_18-5-rgb_front now you hold the tip about an eighth of an inch over the surface
04hnjlkhh2g_19-5-rgb_front and you squeeze until you get a little star
04hnjlkhh2g_2-5-rgb_front the fullness of the bag is going to sit in the palm of your hand like that
04hnjlkhh2g_20-5-rgb_front and you release the pressure of your hand and lift up at the same time
04hnjlkhh2g_21-5-rgb_front now here is what you do not do
04hnjlkhh2g_22-5-rgb_front i am squeezing squeezing squeezing and then i am lifting
04hnjlkhh2g_23-5-rgb_front and i end up with a big tip here that we do not want
04hnjlkhh2g_24-5-rgb_front you want to hold it squeeze release pressure and pull up
04hnjlkhh2g_25-5-rgb_front and then you get a nice star
04hnjlkhh2g_3-5-rgb_front now you can twist the bag while pinching that top pinching the twist with your thumb and your finger in your hand like that
04hnjlkhh2g_4-5-rgb_front and that causes a pressure in the bag
04hnjlkhh2g_5-5-rgb_front you can feel that it gets full and tight and you really want to hold on tightly with your thumb and finger like that
04hnjlkhh2g_6-5-rgb_front now you will use your fingers the other four fingers and your palm to squeeze the bag
04hnjlkhh2g_7-5-rgb_front and as it squeezes the frosting out you will have to continue to turn and twist the bag while holding on tightly with your thumb and the edge of your hand right here
04hnjlkhh2g_8-5-rgb_front you can see here how as i twist it i am holding tightly here and when i squeeze the frosting will come out
04hnjlkhh2g_9-5-rgb_front and i am squeezing with my fingers and my palm
05lwn7tideo_0-5-rgb_front if i hit a shot and i have this right hand so i hit a shot i am already slower if i have got my left hand i can turn and be going or i can grab across like this
05lwn7tideo_1-5-rgb_front so while this hand is free i am moving but if i have to hit and then grab and then turn in like this i have lost a half a second getting to that corner and i am three feet further this way instead of if i would have hit the ball and spun this way
05lwn7tideo_2-5-rgb_front now much better position right here
05lwn7tideo_3-5-rgb_front and those are little things that you just have to learn over the years unless somebody watches you and says get your butt out of this part of the court you know
05lwn7tideo_4-5-rgb_front but i am not a pro tennis player these are just little things i know in my head in a wheel chair you can not cover a court as fast as some you know we ought to put some of you in that chair and we ought to play you know
05lwn7tideo_5-5-rgb_front it is different it is a whole different world
05lwn7tideo_6-5-rgb_front now your strokes would be better than mine even right now but you would be all fouled up with the with the wheel chair
05lwn7tideo_7-5-rgb_front but a good player that has the strokes once they get the wheel chair down you are in trouble
05gjcxakphc_1-5-rgb_front for starters you have to know how to pair your shoes with the right outfit
05gjcxakphc_10-5-rgb_front you can wear them over jeans under jeans or here you can pair them with leggings and they have a slenderizing affect
05gjcxakphc_11-5-rgb_front join us in the next segment and we are going to be talking about how to accessorize with a belt
05gjcxakphc_2-5-rgb_front if you are wearing a dress such as a short dress you can wear large clunky shoes that may or may not match your outfit
05gjcxakphc_3-5-rgb_front one of my favorite things to do is to wear large wedge shoes with a short cute cocktail dress
05gjcxakphc_4-5-rgb_front also what you can do is this today i am wearing a pair of jeans that i paired up with some heels
05gjcxakphc_5-5-rgb_front if you take a look at these shoes which i actually got from a fashion sale directly from the designer
05gjcxakphc_6-5-rgb_front they are kind of fun
05gjcxakphc_7-5-rgb_front they may not go with every outfit but i have a pretty plain top and jeans on
05gjcxakphc_8-5-rgb_front and since they are heels they can actually make your legs look longer and that can help out any body and any figure when you wear jeans
05gjcxakphc_9-5-rgb_front boots are also a versatile and popular thing this winter
05plyhexjeo_0-5-rgb_front here i have another style of a criss cross strap in a back view
05plyhexjeo_1-5-rgb_front what i have done here is show that the garment that it is criss crossing and attached to
05plyhexjeo_10-5-rgb_front only they are not braided
05plyhexjeo_11-5-rgb_front but they criss cross each other
05plyhexjeo_12-5-rgb_front they do not just cross
05plyhexjeo_13-5-rgb_front they criss cross
05plyhexjeo_14-5-rgb_front so there is cross and there is criss cross
05plyhexjeo_15-5-rgb_front and then it does not have to have necessarily this many straps
05plyhexjeo_16-5-rgb_front it could have more straps than this
05plyhexjeo_17-5-rgb_front what it is showing is that somehow probably they are going to be sewn in to the back of it
05plyhexjeo_18-5-rgb_front and maybe they attach in the front
05plyhexjeo_19-5-rgb_front or maybe they are stretchy
05plyhexjeo_2-5-rgb_front is going straight across the back
05plyhexjeo_20-5-rgb_front and it just gets put over the head
05plyhexjeo_21-5-rgb_front but this is just another version of a criss cross strap for neck
05plyhexjeo_3-5-rgb_front there is your seam lines
05plyhexjeo_4-5-rgb_front but the criss cross factor and remember this is a back view
05plyhexjeo_5-5-rgb_front because i cut off her head
05plyhexjeo_6-5-rgb_front when you see that that means it is on the back
05plyhexjeo_7-5-rgb_front i also have indicated back view if you can not read it
05plyhexjeo_8-5-rgb_front but the criss cross means that over under over under
05plyhexjeo_9-5-rgb_front like they are braided
05snmpwcv98_0-5-rgb_front the next variation of a vest that you can design or that you can build on as far as your design process goes and again all this stuff is for you to just try
05snmpwcv98_1-5-rgb_front do not take my ideas literally because what i am doing now and do not take them as who i am as a designer either
05snmpwcv98_10-5-rgb_front there is not really a term for that
05snmpwcv98_11-5-rgb_front it is just too short for being long and too long for being shrunken
05snmpwcv98_12-5-rgb_front shrunken is just shrunken all around
05snmpwcv98_13-5-rgb_front ribbing you know what a ribbing is knit contrast to the regular knit that is there
05snmpwcv98_2_3-5-rgb_front i need to say that because they are just shapes for you to build on i am doing the most basic and elementary things that i can think of that give my concept a way of establishing itself in your head and then letting you build on that concept
05snmpwcv98_4-5-rgb_front this is a shrunken sweater vest with ribbing
05snmpwcv98_5-5-rgb_front everybody knows what that is
05snmpwcv98_6-5-rgb_front it is going to hit to be shrunken and needs to hit above above the hips
05snmpwcv98_7-5-rgb_front it needs to hit above the waist typically or right at the waist
05snmpwcv98_8-5-rgb_front that is technically shrunken
05snmpwcv98_9-5-rgb_front if it hits a little bit below the waist well you just do not need to try it because it shrinks
05svbr3fjd4_1-5-rgb_front this one is called x marks the spot and it is a little routine you do to try to give your child a chill with goose bumps all over ruckel is going to help us turn around so that i can see your back hand motion x marks the spot with a circle and a dot shrivel up shrivel down shrivel all around with a pinch and a squeeze and a nice cool breeze blow these are the chills laughing did you get goose bumps ya this one is called crack an egg on your head hand motions crack an egg on your head let the yolk drip down let the yolk drip down let the yolk drip down crack an egg on your head let the yolk drip down squeeze an orange on your shoulders let the juice drip down let the juice drip down squeeze an orange on your shoulders let the juice drip down let the juice drip down spiders crawling up your back spiders crawling down spiders crawling up your back spiders crawling down with a pinch and a squeeze and a cool ocean breeze blow did you feel the chills ya
06s7xxxhwis_0-5-rgb_front the final area to massage for a dog with especially with problems with the front legs is going to be the side of the face between the eye and the jaw
06s7xxxhwis_1-5-rgb_front again this may be an area that a dog will object to
06s7xxxhwis_10-5-rgb_front you get them used to it over time work them into it
06s7xxxhwis_11-5-rgb_front just get them used to a little bit of face touching and then as they get calmer you can do a little bit more and a little bit more
06s7xxxhwis_2-5-rgb_front some dogs will really like it
06s7xxxhwis_3-5-rgb_front if your dog will allow you to do it those cheek muscles right between the eye and the bottom of the jaw just a nice circular motion
06s7xxxhwis_4-5-rgb_front you want to be a little bit more gentle in this area than you have been on the back
06s7xxxhwis_5-5-rgb_front there is not as thick a muscle and this is a good relaxing pain relieving particularly works down the front legs
06s7xxxhwis_6-5-rgb_front it is a continuation of one of those nice front leg meridians
06s7xxxhwis_7-5-rgb_front so again you are going to do the same on the other side
06s7xxxhwis_8-5-rgb_front if the dog is nice and relaxed and quiet you can do both cheeks at once and you are just going to do a nice broad fingertip or palm of the hand circular motion and just relax that whole area
06s7xxxhwis_9-5-rgb_front this is one again if your dog is really not up for or really does not want their face rubbed do not worry about it
06st8w_jhok_0-5-rgb_front the first step of our seascape is surprise surprise not supplies
06st8w_jhok_1-5-rgb_front actually what we first want to do is decide what we want to paint
06st8w_jhok_10-5-rgb_front and this is kind of the next step what makes a good picture
06st8w_jhok_11-5-rgb_front for example this picture here on the left oh that tree there and that gnarled piece of driftwood which has been pushed up right by the current in the sand
06st8w_jhok_12-5-rgb_front that is pretty interesting
06st8w_jhok_13-5-rgb_front but the problem is the framing is all wrong
06st8w_jhok_14-5-rgb_front this here in the foreground is kind of blocking out and distracting from the very interesting landscape back here behind
06st8w_jhok_15-5-rgb_front most of which is water
06st8w_jhok_16-5-rgb_front seascapes do not have to purely be just the sea
06st8w_jhok_17-5-rgb_front actually if you are ever painting just water it is kind of boring
06st8w_jhok_18-5-rgb_front it is nice to have a shoreline some shore items some froth and foam some out cropping rocks
06st8w_jhok_19-5-rgb_front but this here is just too distracting
06st8w_jhok_2-5-rgb_front there are a variety of ways you can do this
06st8w_jhok_20-5-rgb_front despite it being interesting it is a no go
06st8w_jhok_21-5-rgb_front so this one that is out
06st8w_jhok_22-5-rgb_front now this one on the other hand this one holds promise
06st8w_jhok_23-5-rgb_front you again have a prominent sea on the side a lot of water and beach and waves breaking in the surf here
06st8w_jhok_24-5-rgb_front and you have a really cool geological basically out cropping here which has been eroded around by the water but it is so tall it has fertile soil on the top
06st8w_jhok_25-5-rgb_front so this is great
06st8w_jhok_26-5-rgb_front this is like a little island
06st8w_jhok_27-5-rgb_front it is an island right in the middle of the sea with nice shears strong lines which is going to make for a very interesting subject for your seascape
06st8w_jhok_3-5-rgb_front first and foremost if you can paint outdoors you have a great beach nearby get out of your house
06st8w_jhok_4-5-rgb_front heck you can stop watching this right now and run out after you see the remaining steps
06st8w_jhok_5-5-rgb_front that is the best way to do it
06st8w_jhok_6-5-rgb_front up there live close and personal
06st8w_jhok_7-5-rgb_front so go down to the beach and paint
06st8w_jhok_8-5-rgb_front paint whatever strikes you as interesting
06st8w_jhok_9-5-rgb_front now if you are not so lucky to live near the ocean then you have to rely on pictures
06yvm4x81wi_0-5-rgb_front let is start by talking about one of the most basic and archaic ways to cut a hole in the ice and that is using a hand chisel
06yvm4x81wi_1-5-rgb_front now safety again is always the most important aspect
06yvm4x81wi_10-5-rgb_front but they are great to have especially for checking the ice close to shore when you come out on a water body
06yvm4x81wi_11-5-rgb_front there is really nothing much to it other than simply taking a firm grasp on it and just starting to cut into the ice
06yvm4x81wi_12-5-rgb_front chipping it out as you go rotate the blade and just continue with it until you hit that water
06yvm4x81wi_13-5-rgb_front one good tip is and i do not have it here today but is to always attach a rope with a tied loop to the top of this
06yvm4x81wi_14-5-rgb_front you can put that around your wrist put it around your shoulders so just in case when you finally go through if you loose your grip on your chisel you are not going to lose it because your rope will help save it
06yvm4x81wi_2-5-rgb_front the blades are these chisels are typically pretty sharp
06yvm4x81wi_3-5-rgb_front you always want to cover them when they are not in use
06yvm4x81wi_4-5-rgb_front you always want to be conscious of where that blade is in relation to where you are where your kids where your friends are when you are fishing
06yvm4x81wi_5-5-rgb_front now these chisels are great to have
06yvm4x81wi_6-5-rgb_front i always bring one with me especially early and late season when the ice is thin
06yvm4x81wi_7-5-rgb_front it is a great way to chop a quick hole probably only take you a minute or so
06yvm4x81wi_8-5-rgb_front during when the ice is thick say even thicker than six seven inches using a hand chisel can be quite a task
06yvm4x81wi_9-5-rgb_front taking maybe upwards of five six minutes to cut a decent hole
06bq_dxqgju_0-5-rgb_front okay in this segment i am going to serve to ken he is going to return his forehead up the line he is going to return them down the middle and he is going to return them cross court
06bq_dxqgju_1-5-rgb_front it is very important that you practice hitting all your server turns to the different parts of the court
06bq_dxqgju_2-5-rgb_front for example if you are playing doubles you are going to want to learn to return all your balls cross court because if you go up the line there is going to be player there ready to volley the ball
06bq_dxqgju_3-5-rgb_front now there is exceptions to that because sometimes they will mix up where they stand but in singles your best return is generally down the middle but if you the player you are playing is serving and he is rushing the net you might not want to give it right to him you might want to be on a hit an angle cross court or go down the line
06bq_dxqgju_4-5-rgb_front so ken is going to demonstrate how to serve or turn the serve down the line okay again
06bq_dxqgju_5-5-rgb_front okay that one went up the middle because he did not turn enough on the ball
06bq_dxqgju_6-5-rgb_front down the line ken turn turn turn good okay now return it to me
06bq_dxqgju_7-5-rgb_front okay that one is right up the middle right up the middle good shot
06bq_dxqgju_8-5-rgb_front cross court so you see how ken has to move his body to go cross court and one more okay so that is the idea is you want to be able to return to all different spots of the court and as you get more proficient you can hit them short wider angled you can return them deep so you can move you can keep the server off balance with a high quality return
06d7cio6ksa_0-5-rgb_front from time to time many cats will have an episode of diarrhea
06d7cio6ksa_1-5-rgb_front so one of the things that you want to do is check your litter box daily to see if the stool is normal
06d7cio6ksa_2-5-rgb_front this stool in the middle of the box here is a completely normal stool
06d7cio6ksa_3-5-rgb_front it is formed and it is not too hard it is definitely and and not so firm that you can not deform it
06d7cio6ksa_4-5-rgb_front this on the other hand is definitely diarrhea
06d7cio6ksa_5-5-rgb_front this is soft there is hardly any form to it and you can see that it is almost a pudding consistency
06d7cio6ksa_6-5-rgb_front if at home your cat has diarrhea just one time and it seems to be otherwise healthy it is playing its eating normally everything else is going well you can try adding some soft cooked rice to your cat is food for a day or two and if you are feeding a lot of treats or if it is been getting any table food you would want to discontinue that
06d7cio6ksa_7-5-rgb_front definitely if the diarrhea continues for more than a day then you should consult with your veterinarian about further treatment options
06jk1stvwmi_0-5-rgb_front bridge pose is a classic finishing pose that can be done in prenatal yoga
06jk1stvwmi_1-5-rgb_front as long as it is still comfortable for you to be lying on your back
06jk1stvwmi_10-5-rgb_front now press in the hips up to the sky
06jk1stvwmi_11-5-rgb_front nice gentle strengthening of the spine helps relieve some tension
06jk1stvwmi_12-5-rgb_front keep looking straight up
06jk1stvwmi_13-5-rgb_front whenever you have any constriction on the neck not looking side to side
06jk1stvwmi_14-5-rgb_front keep looking straight up to the sky pressing your arms down into the mat
06jk1stvwmi_15-5-rgb_front if it is comfortable for you if it is part of your practice you can bring the arms underneath you into moodrem
06jk1stvwmi_16-5-rgb_front i think she prefers to bring it into moodrem
06jk1stvwmi_17-5-rgb_front perfect
06jk1stvwmi_18-5-rgb_front clasp the fingers together press the arms into the mat
06jk1stvwmi_19-5-rgb_front you also have to come a little bit higher onto those shoulders lovely
06jk1stvwmi_2-5-rgb_front are you comfortable
06jk1stvwmi_20-5-rgb_front one more nice breath holding the pose
06jk1stvwmi_21-5-rgb_front long complete exhale
06jk1stvwmi_22-5-rgb_front release the hands out to your sides press up onto your tippy toes take a nice deep inhale exhale very slowly very gently lowering down one vertebrae at a time
06jk1stvwmi_23-5-rgb_front always going in and out of bridge as slow as you possibly can
06jk1stvwmi_24-5-rgb_front perfect
06jk1stvwmi_25-5-rgb_front whenever you are done you can release the heels back towards the earth
06jk1stvwmi_26-5-rgb_front beautiful
06jk1stvwmi_3-5-rgb_front i do have a blanket underneath her head for just a little bit of support on her neck
06jk1stvwmi_4-5-rgb_front alright bridge pose
06jk1stvwmi_5-5-rgb_front you want to bring your feet about hip width apart heels slightly closer to the hips than you normally would arms dropped down to your sides palms on the earth
06jk1stvwmi_6-5-rgb_front important to work with your breath in this pose
06jk1stvwmi_7-5-rgb_front take a nice deep inhale
06jk1stvwmi_8-5-rgb_front as you exhale press into the feet lift the hips up slightly
06jk1stvwmi_9-5-rgb_front now you do not want to take it to the full limit perfect
06k75hrlfqc_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is ashley ludman from seaside yoga here today to talk to you about hot yoga
06k75hrlfqc_1-8-rgb_front so a few years ago bikram yoga was developed and franchised by bikram chadroy
06k75hrlfqc_10-8-rgb_front so hot yoga hot room hot practice hope you enjoy it
06k75hrlfqc_2-8-rgb_front from that branched out a lot of styles of hot yoga that did not really have anything to do with the franchise of bikram yoga
06k75hrlfqc_3-8-rgb_front but in essence hot yoga is a yoga style that is practiced within a room that is deliberately heated
06k75hrlfqc_4-8-rgb_front sometimes up to temperatures of a hundred and ten degrees
06k75hrlfqc_5-8-rgb_front and the purpose of heating the room in a hot yoga class is to create greater detoxification benefits
06k75hrlfqc_6-8-rgb_front so not only are you internally heating through your breath and through the movement of postures from one posture to the next but the room is externally heated
06k75hrlfqc_7-8-rgb_front and there should be a little bit of humanity within that that sphere of the room
06k75hrlfqc_8-8-rgb_front you may find various sequences in a hot yoga class where bikram yoga is one particular sequence and one particular class of twenty six postures
06k75hrlfqc_9-8-rgb_front in the hot yoga class you may find that you are moving through postures in a more flowing way
06ta1xvast8_0-5-rgb_front now you will notice with our edges already sort of peeled away you are like well you know some of the toners coming off it all looks a little rugged
06ta1xvast8_1-5-rgb_front first off some of the rugged harder edged effects that is part of the transfer
06ta1xvast8_10-5-rgb_front cause yeah some of the toner will come off that is part again part of sort of part of the effect but you should still be able to very easily recognize the picture underneath
06ta1xvast8_11-5-rgb_front and you should not be taking off big heaps of toner
06ta1xvast8_12-5-rgb_front that means you are scrubbing too hard
06ta1xvast8_13-5-rgb_front so with the smooth side we are going to work in here all through out the middle until we have all the paper that we want all the paper fiber is going to be off
06ta1xvast8_2-5-rgb_front you gotta keep in mind that a lot of those with smoother edges that the grays and the whites are going to be reduced down to like you know darker than wood
06ta1xvast8_3-5-rgb_front what is more if you discover if you think too much toner is coming off to the point where you are losing the image odds are you are scrubbing too hard
06ta1xvast8_4-5-rgb_front go from the rough side to the smooth side
06ta1xvast8_5-5-rgb_front what is more in terms of getting into like the really more detailed areas where you are just going to be on the basic shape of the shoulder
06ta1xvast8_6-5-rgb_front i strong strongly recommend just rubbing with the smooth side and having a lot of water cause this is going to help you get even more of the paper off
06ta1xvast8_7-5-rgb_front and you will notice that you know a lot of the toner underneath here is staying on much more so than what you had on lower below
06ta1xvast8_8-5-rgb_front but yeah if you find out that a lot of it is coming off stop scrubbing so hard
06ta1xvast8_9-5-rgb_front that is probably the big problem
072dgdbjfkq_0-5-rgb_front the next easter card i am going to show you is a lot of fun and it has a film strip technique
072dgdbjfkq_1-5-rgb_front here is the card that we are going to be making and does not that look like a cute little film strip
072dgdbjfkq_10-5-rgb_front when ever you are using the punches the punch always has to be up so you can see where you are punching
072dgdbjfkq_11-5-rgb_front so there is one two three for our film strip
072dgdbjfkq_12-5-rgb_front now i will not cut out the chick punches until i have stamped on them
072dgdbjfkq_13-5-rgb_front it makes it a lot easier for me to see the images where i need them
072dgdbjfkq_14-5-rgb_front so let me go ahead and stamp three chicks
072dgdbjfkq_15-5-rgb_front and i am just stamping my chicks in black
072dgdbjfkq_16-5-rgb_front and what i want to do i want to capture him i got a little smudge so i need to stamp one more time
072dgdbjfkq_17-5-rgb_front what i want to do here is capture him at three different stages
072dgdbjfkq_18-5-rgb_front where he is just peaking where he is got the middle of his body and then the top of his body kind of pulling out of the screen
072dgdbjfkq_19-5-rgb_front so by doing that what i am going to do is use my square line them up
072dgdbjfkq_2-5-rgb_front you can use this card again for any card any season but we are going to be doing easter
072dgdbjfkq_20-5-rgb_front the first one i want is just going to be his nose
072dgdbjfkq_21_22-5-rgb_front i am going to punch that out the middle one is going to be his body i am going to punch that out
072dgdbjfkq_23-5-rgb_front and the last one is going to be his body but he is going to be kind of leaving the scene
072dgdbjfkq_24-5-rgb_front so i need to get a little bit in here and i am just going to get the top of my chick
072dgdbjfkq_25-5-rgb_front sometimes you have to cut your little paper a little bit just to get your puncher and there is my third
072dgdbjfkq_26-5-rgb_front so i have all my punches done and now i can start coloring
072dgdbjfkq_3-5-rgb_front so let me get started
072dgdbjfkq_4-5-rgb_front first thing i am going to do is cut and score my paper
072dgdbjfkq_5-5-rgb_front i need a piece of wild wasabi at five and a half times four and a quarter where i am going to be scoring
072dgdbjfkq_6-5-rgb_front that is my card base
072dgdbjfkq_7-5-rgb_front and then i need a piece of the black which is going to be the film strip and i am going to cut that at two and three quarters times five and a half which is the length of the card
072dgdbjfkq_8-5-rgb_front alright now the next pieces that we are going to be using i do not need my cutters for we are going to have fun with punching
072dgdbjfkq_9-5-rgb_front i need three squares of the so saffron
075s9decj2k_1-5-rgb_front now i have shown you all of the drills that are necessary to master before you can get a nice clean backhand spring and move on to a more advance skill like a back tuck
075s9decj2k_10-5-rgb_front this is a backhand spring again on a floor
075s9decj2k_2-5-rgb_front so keeping in mind all of those drills that i have shown you watch my backhand spring on this floor and see how everything i have done up to this moment leads me up to right here
075s9decj2k_3-5-rgb_front it is very important to be implemented into my technique using my backhand spring
075s9decj2k_4-5-rgb_front watch how i jump off my toes last just like i did on the trampoline
075s9decj2k_5-5-rgb_front watch how i extend my arms past my shoulders just like i did in the jump back and swing my arms quickly as i did in the arm string drill
075s9decj2k_6-5-rgb_front my sit is going to be very similar if not identical to the set that i did up against the wedge mat
075s9decj2k_7-5-rgb_front my arms are going to be nice and straight as they were in all the drills that i have showed you
075s9decj2k_8-5-rgb_front i m going to block with my shoulders rather than bending my elbows like i did in all the blocking drills that i have showed you
075s9decj2k_9-5-rgb_front you are really going to be able to see how important it is to slow down take the time to master each element of the backhand spring before tackling the backhand spring as a whole
077iib5uucs_0_1_2-5-rgb_front alright juggling three clubs alright we discussed how to hold two in one hand we discussed every aspect now it is the time to do it
077iib5uucs_10-5-rgb_front if i stand sideways you will get a better look
077iib5uucs_11-5-rgb_front they are nice slow single rotations and it is not because of how i am spinning them it is because of how high i am throwing them
077iib5uucs_12-5-rgb_front of course it is possible to spin them faster but like i said before it is not necessary
077iib5uucs_13-5-rgb_front spinning them faster is another trick in itself just throwing them is hard enough for most people
077iib5uucs_3-5-rgb_front okay it is just like juggling three balls except you have to be careful because if you throw them so that they will go away from your body or towards your body there is a much greater chance of you hitting yourself in the face
077iib5uucs_4-5-rgb_front i have been hit in the mouth
077iib5uucs_5-5-rgb_front i have been hit in the eye
077iib5uucs_6-5-rgb_front i had seen people do both and it hurts
077iib5uucs_7-5-rgb_front so you got to be careful when you first start okay and it is like most things not as hard as it looks to you when you first start
077iib5uucs_8-5-rgb_front it is way slower than you think but this is how it looks okay
077iib5uucs_9-5-rgb_front if you notice it is nice slow single rotations
077rqk39ycg_1-5-rgb_front we are moving on to the next step in our quick thai curry
077rqk39ycg_10-5-rgb_front they are not going to be overdone
077rqk39ycg_11-5-rgb_front so everything that we are going to cook today is cooked very quickly
077rqk39ycg_12-5-rgb_front this is not a long cooking process that we are going to be doing
077rqk39ycg_13-5-rgb_front looks like our wok is ready to go
077rqk39ycg_14-5-rgb_front the first thing we are going to do is add at least one or two cloves of garlic
077rqk39ycg_15-5-rgb_front get that in and get that going
077rqk39ycg_16-5-rgb_front that is a nice base flavor for anything that we are going to be cooking today
077rqk39ycg_17-5-rgb_front and then the next thing we are going to add are our heavier vegetables like our carrot our onion and today we are using peppers
077rqk39ycg_18-5-rgb_front so let is get our peppers in there
077rqk39ycg_19-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that your vegetables are in
077rqk39ycg_2-5-rgb_front now we have got our vegetables ready to go that we have talked about
077rqk39ycg_20-5-rgb_front toss your vegetables around
077rqk39ycg_21-5-rgb_front okay
077rqk39ycg_22-5-rgb_front there is our vegetables
077rqk39ycg_23-5-rgb_front we are stirring them keeping them moving so that they cook evenly in the wok
077rqk39ycg_24-5-rgb_front it is important that you do keep them moving so that you do not end up with your vegetables cooked unevenly
077rqk39ycg_25-5-rgb_front if you were cooking with broccoli or another harder vegetable like that you would also want those in at this time
077rqk39ycg_26-5-rgb_front just keep moving that around
077rqk39ycg_27-5-rgb_front you can leave it periodically
077rqk39ycg_28-5-rgb_front let the vegetables heat up and in about thirty seconds or so come on back keep it moving again
077rqk39ycg_29-5-rgb_front in a minute we will be back and talk about the next step in our dinner
077rqk39ycg_3-5-rgb_front we are firing up our wok
077rqk39ycg_4-5-rgb_front a little bit of oil on the bottom of the wok
077rqk39ycg_5-5-rgb_front get that hot and ready to go
077rqk39ycg_6-5-rgb_front the first thing you want to add to your wok are your fresh vegetables
077rqk39ycg_7-5-rgb_front if you are using frozen vegetables you want to take those out of their package let them defrost for a couple of minutes
077rqk39ycg_8-5-rgb_front if you are mixing fresh and frozen you definitely want to get your frozen vegetables out so they are maybe up to almost room temperature so that everything is going to cook at the same pace
077rqk39ycg_9-5-rgb_front when we are cooking with a wok and cooking thai food your vegetables are going to be crispy
079tjgcukm4_0-5-rgb_front in this segment i am going to talk about unleashing your spirit from singing
079tjgcukm4_1-5-rgb_front as much as technique is important nothing can beat the importance of artistry
079tjgcukm4_2-5-rgb_front there is a point where you just have to let technique go you have to just let it sink down naturally in your body and then you have to forget about it
079tjgcukm4_3-5-rgb_front i mean if i where overly concerned about technique the place the opening of my mouth i will survive i will survive
079tjgcukm4_4-5-rgb_front i mean but i have to let it go
079tjgcukm4_5-5-rgb_front i have to be afraid to make mistakes
079tjgcukm4_6-5-rgb_front it feels like jumping off the cliff i will survive i will survive
079tjgcukm4_7-5-rgb_front here is the thing it feels terrifying i mean until you get really use to singing in front of people it is terrifying and there is a reason for that
079tjgcukm4_8-5-rgb_front you really are exposing your soul but just know that you are safe people generally do not judge people who take a risk
07egksimsl0_0-5-rgb_front now i am ready to treat
07egksimsl0_1-5-rgb_front i have prepped matt
07egksimsl0_10-5-rgb_front there we go
07egksimsl0_11-5-rgb_front it is treated perfect
07egksimsl0_12-5-rgb_front so now we continue
07egksimsl0_13-5-rgb_front now that i know what it takes i am off and running
07egksimsl0_14-5-rgb_front there we go
07egksimsl0_15-5-rgb_front another hair another hair and this is the blend
07egksimsl0_16-5-rgb_front so this is a little slower than if it was high frequency
07egksimsl0_17-5-rgb_front high frequency would be probably almost half the time to treat as it is the blend
07egksimsl0_18-5-rgb_front but it is the numbers on that treatment is somewhere in the forty percentile fifty percentile with high frequency vs up to eighty nine or ninety per cent kill ratio when you use the blend
07egksimsl0_19-5-rgb_front so i like those numbers
07egksimsl0_2-5-rgb_front i have got his hair ready
07egksimsl0_20-5-rgb_front so that is kind of why i go that direction and i do not like fast and hot and quick
07egksimsl0_21-5-rgb_front you have too much imperfection in the work as far as i am concerned
07egksimsl0_3-5-rgb_front we have spoke about what he had like and what treatment he wants
07egksimsl0_4-5-rgb_front he is made the decision of electrology
07egksimsl0_5-5-rgb_front so now we are going to start our work
07egksimsl0_6-5-rgb_front i have the timer on and we are working
07egksimsl0_7-5-rgb_front now these hairs are growing downward and there is a kind of this way that i hold the probe in my hand and i taunt that skin so i get that hair just at the right angle and then in we go and then to see what it takes to do matt is hair in the back
07egksimsl0_8-5-rgb_front this hair is a little bit different
07egksimsl0_9-5-rgb_front i need to go a little bit deeper and stay a little bit longer
07hhpnrotxs_0-5-rgb_front we have chosen a pink silver and black theme for this one and that can go anywhere
07hhpnrotxs_1-5-rgb_front and just want to let you know that you can be creative and take this theme wherever it can go
07hhpnrotxs_2-5-rgb_front like say you are having a hannah montana party which is one of the most popular themes going right now
07hhpnrotxs_3-5-rgb_front so you can grab anything hannah montana like these little blowouts and stick them in the centerpiece or just stick them on the top so her picture is showing
07hhpnrotxs_4-5-rgb_front you can even use an invitation or just anything with her picture and just put it on the top or another good idea is to get just the paper plates and tape them together just two plates like this faced out
07hhpnrotxs_5-5-rgb_front and just put them on the top and it like really lets your guests know really what your theme is
07hhpnrotxs_6-5-rgb_front and when they walk in they see the table and they know that they can be celebrating your birthday with hannah montana
07tdlphnhtu_0-5-rgb_front in order to string jewelry you are going to need something to put it on
07tdlphnhtu_1-5-rgb_front i actually started out with fishing line and you can make knots in it
07tdlphnhtu_10-5-rgb_front and you can just stretch it over your arm like that
07tdlphnhtu_11-5-rgb_front you do a full knot with both strands or a square knot with that
07tdlphnhtu_12-5-rgb_front and i also use memory wire
07tdlphnhtu_13-5-rgb_front memory wire goes back to its original form
07tdlphnhtu_14-5-rgb_front here is a necklace and a bracelet
07tdlphnhtu_15-5-rgb_front you do not have to have a clasp with it
07tdlphnhtu_16-5-rgb_front it just goes back like that
07tdlphnhtu_2-5-rgb_front but i do not have that today
07tdlphnhtu_3-5-rgb_front i use steel wire or tiger tail is what they call it
07tdlphnhtu_4-5-rgb_front and there are different diameters
07tdlphnhtu_5-5-rgb_front there is really thick and really thin depending on how heavy your necklace is or how heavy your beads are
07tdlphnhtu_6-5-rgb_front and here are some samples
07tdlphnhtu_7-5-rgb_front this is all done with tiger tail
07tdlphnhtu_8-5-rgb_front and that is basically what i use to make basic necklaces
07tdlphnhtu_9-5-rgb_front and there is also stretchy cord which everybody knows about power bracelets and that is what they are put on
07u8pef63pw_0-5-rgb_front now it is time for the first of the off body tricks
07u8pef63pw_1-5-rgb_front this trick is called the lasso
07u8pef63pw_10-5-rgb_front you can kind of isolate it spinning it around
07u8pef63pw_11-5-rgb_front if you would like to you can even drop down on the floor and strike some hot pinup girl poses in it
07u8pef63pw_12-5-rgb_front you can take your hands up in prayer
07u8pef63pw_13-5-rgb_front you can do the right
07u8pef63pw_14-5-rgb_front you can do the left
07u8pef63pw_15-5-rgb_front you can even take it and isolate it somewhat holding it there
07u8pef63pw_16-5-rgb_front have a lot of fun with this move
07u8pef63pw_17-5-rgb_front lifting it up and away from the body
07u8pef63pw_18-5-rgb_front squatting down
07u8pef63pw_19-5-rgb_front make this move your own
07u8pef63pw_2-5-rgb_front i wonder why
07u8pef63pw_20-5-rgb_front you ready to give it a try
07u8pef63pw_3-5-rgb_front
07u8pef63pw_4-5-rgb_front it kind of feels and looks like you are a cowboy
07u8pef63pw_5-5-rgb_front this is great move
07u8pef63pw_6-5-rgb_front it is strengthens the arms
07u8pef63pw_7-5-rgb_front it is nice and big so you can clear space with it
07u8pef63pw_8-5-rgb_front it is also one of the moves that you will move in and out of throughout your whole hooping routine
07u8pef63pw_9-5-rgb_front you can turn with it
07viw5bdesw_0-1-rgb_front hi it is dow here at the firehouse detail center today we are detailing the exterior of your car and we are teaching you how to be an expert at doing it as well
07viw5bdesw_1-1-rgb_front in a previous segment we applied wax
07viw5bdesw_10-1-rgb_front once its been hazed over and its had a chance to dry then we want to circle back using a microfiber towel and again have several towels turn it frequently use a clean area of the towel to remove it
07viw5bdesw_11-1-rgb_front you are going to want to remove it the same direction you put it on which is the way that the wind flows over the car back and forth
07viw5bdesw_12-1-rgb_front we are going to go back and forth covering new areas again flipping my towel frequently so that i have got a fresh new area as i go over it
07viw5bdesw_13-1-rgb_front now when i hit an area like this detail trim here where the headlight is
07viw5bdesw_14-1-rgb_front if i have got wax in there i can get a detail brush to go through and remove wax
07viw5bdesw_15-1-rgb_front i can even you know wrap a towel in it and go into the crevices or fold a towel if i have got a bumper line like that i can fold the towel and just press it along the crevice like that
07viw5bdesw_16_17-1-rgb_front when it comes out it is gone in and it is removed any excess wax you can move through the car wax removal pretty quickly but pay attention to details because when you have too much wax in a crevice that is an area that is going to make your customer disappointed and you are not going to like the way it looks on your own vehicle if you are a do it yourselfer
07viw5bdesw_18-1-rgb_front with that the microfiber towel will leave a nice shine and the paint finish is going to be just perfect for ninety to one hundred and twenty days
07viw5bdesw_19-1-rgb_front you can go back and reapply wax more often than that but we find that our customers are delighted for at least ninety or one hundred and twenty days
07viw5bdesw_2-1-rgb_front we talked about the selection of wax and picking the wax that is best for you
07viw5bdesw_3-1-rgb_front an important part of waxing the car is actually the removal of the wax
07viw5bdesw_4-1-rgb_front we want to use the right equipment to remove it and we want to make sure we remove wax in the crevices and cracks
07viw5bdesw_5-1-rgb_front so we do not want to fly through this too fast because you will have a disappointed customer or you will be disappointed at the look of your vehicle if you have got excess wax
07viw5bdesw_6-1-rgb_front so be cautious not to put too much wax to begin with
07viw5bdesw_7-1-rgb_front one of the common problems we have is people use too much wax
07viw5bdesw_8-1-rgb_front you just do not need a ton a tremendous amount of product
07viw5bdesw_9-1-rgb_front a little bit of wax goes a long ways
07mfg9turou_0-5-rgb_front so our next exercise is called the scissor as you might know or the correct pilates term would be the single straight leg stretch
07mfg9turou_10-5-rgb_front yes
07mfg9turou_11-5-rgb_front from here grab onto your right ankle
07mfg9turou_12-5-rgb_front if you can not reach you can grab onto your right knee as well
07mfg9turou_13-5-rgb_front scissor the left leg all the way down
07mfg9turou_14-5-rgb_front so you are going to use your exhale here as you pulse the leg in twice towards your face
07mfg9turou_15-5-rgb_front so your hand position should be onto your ankle
07mfg9turou_16-5-rgb_front if you are having trouble reaching your ankle you can come down to your calf or even back to the knee
07mfg9turou_17-5-rgb_front the most important thing is that your leg stays straight
07mfg9turou_18-5-rgb_front you do not want to pull in a bent leg
07mfg9turou_19-5-rgb_front you want to keep it long and lean
07mfg9turou_1_2_3_4-5-rgb_front ok that is a lot of ss in there so let is get started mark is going to lay all the way down beautiful
07mfg9turou_20-5-rgb_front so breathing is very important on this next exercise as well as the others
07mfg9turou_21-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that you are bell button scoops in in as you exhale
07mfg9turou_22-5-rgb_front so your belly button presses down down and then you switch
07mfg9turou_23-5-rgb_front belly button goes down down and switch
07mfg9turou_24-5-rgb_front you compact those muscles into that breath so you are contracting those muscles as well as working them at the same time
07mfg9turou_25-5-rgb_front it creates a longer leaner muscle
07mfg9turou_26-5-rgb_front so you have exhale whoo whoo and switch navel scoops
07mfg9turou_27-5-rgb_front see your navel pushing in in on that exhale
07mfg9turou_28-5-rgb_front press
07mfg9turou_29-5-rgb_front press
07mfg9turou_30-5-rgb_front long legs
07mfg9turou_31-5-rgb_front stretch and lengthen those legs
07mfg9turou_32-5-rgb_front pulse
07mfg9turou_33-5-rgb_front pulse
07mfg9turou_34-5-rgb_front stay curled up
07mfg9turou_35-5-rgb_front pulse
07mfg9turou_36-5-rgb_front pulse
07mfg9turou_37-5-rgb_front so notice mark is upper body is not moving here it is just the legs moving so you are getting those lower abs working
07mfg9turou_38-5-rgb_front good
07mfg9turou_39-5-rgb_front give me three more
07mfg9turou_40-5-rgb_front three and press and two straight out press last one and one
07mfg9turou_41-5-rgb_front draw the knees in towards the chest
07mfg9turou_42-5-rgb_front relax head neck and shoulders all the way down
07mfg9turou_43-5-rgb_front take a rest
07mfg9turou_44-5-rgb_front the next clip with be the single no the double straight leg stretch
07mfg9turou_5-5-rgb_front from here you are going to bend your knees into your chest
07mfg9turou_6-5-rgb_front again that proximal position curl the head neck and shoulders up
07mfg9turou_7-5-rgb_front from here the legs go straight up in the air
07mfg9turou_8-5-rgb_front reach the toes toward the ceiling
07mfg9turou_9-5-rgb_front if you have trouble straightening the back of your hamstrings flex the feet
07n9gntlvdi_0-5-rgb_front abe toke hi
07n9gntlvdi_10-5-rgb_front once you start shaping off the bottom a little bit you will notice that the stringer will start to pop up
07n9gntlvdi_11-5-rgb_front that is when it is a great time to break out this hand planer and just hit the stringer alone
07n9gntlvdi_12-5-rgb_front careful not do not want to reshape this bottom that much so you just really want to just take as consistent smooth cut off the stringer
07n9gntlvdi_13-5-rgb_front i usually start somewhere around the apex of the bottom contour which is generally around the middle of the board and just flow right off the nose
07n9gntlvdi_14-5-rgb_front once i am pretty happy with the relatively flat i got most of the marks out
07n9gntlvdi_15-5-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and flip it over
07n9gntlvdi_16-5-rgb_front the stringer is pretty hard to shape so i usually tend to get that down and then you can shape the foam to the stringer starting on the high points always first
07n9gntlvdi_2-5-rgb_front i am going to take you through step by step to shape yourself a complete surfboard
07n9gntlvdi_3-5-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and clean up this bottom a little bit and then we will go ahead and do the top
07n9gntlvdi_4_5-5-rgb_front and i am going to clean it up with the shearform again when you run your hands across the bottom you can really feel a high spot or a low spot
07n9gntlvdi_6-5-rgb_front i mean you can obviously see that we are a little low here still but just do not want to dig in to this and try to make it up right now
07n9gntlvdi_7-5-rgb_front so just keep on shaping the board is one whole thing
07n9gntlvdi_8-5-rgb_front do not stop in here and dig away and trying to hit a home run with every little stroke
07n9gntlvdi_9-5-rgb_front it is more important that it really stays flat
08jotxfsa4y_0-5-rgb_front now that we have a clean palette we are going to move on to the eyebrows
08jotxfsa4y_1-5-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and fill in amy is eyebrows you can use eyebrow liner in this case i am going to use powder
08jotxfsa4y_10-5-rgb_front same thing i put the puff down so i do not lift off of her skin on yourself you probably would not do this but if you are playing with somebody else s eyebrows and filling in somebody else s eyebrows if you it is a good little trick so that you do not lift off any of the foundation
08jotxfsa4y_11-5-rgb_front that is filling in eyebrows
08jotxfsa4y_2-5-rgb_front a lot of makeup artists that i know use powder as well instead of the actual liner it just gives it a softer more subtle look than the harshness of a liner
08jotxfsa4y_3-5-rgb_front so i am going to pick out the color that i think is closest to her eyebrow and i am going to use an angled brush like this and this is my favorite brush for filling in the eyebrows i use it on myself i use it on all of my clients this brush you can get this brush pretty much at every makeup counter
08jotxfsa4y_4-5-rgb_front i am not sure if you can get it at drugstores but i know you can get it at every makeup counter you can get it at you can get it at any beauty supply store
08jotxfsa4y_5-5-rgb_front so you are just going to take a little of that eye shadow is what i am using
08jotxfsa4y_6-5-rgb_front and another cool little trick is so that i do not lift makeup off of her skin i am going to apply the puff onto her cheek and rest my hand here while i apply the eye shadow onto her eyebrow or fill in her eyebrows
08jotxfsa4y_7-5-rgb_front so now i am just taking this angled brush and i am stroking upwards filling in her eyebrows where it is needed and then i will come back for more product once i run out and you want to just again slough off some of the excess eye shadow that you may have
08jotxfsa4y_8-5-rgb_front see how it is filling in really nicely
08jotxfsa4y_9-5-rgb_front the difference between the two eyebrows can i have your chin over here
08pdycn-pxi_1-5-rgb_front what we want to talk about right now is the importance of our linebackers in the set against a passing team
08pdycn-pxi_10-5-rgb_front the middle linebacker has to drop back and he is covering in this middle area
08pdycn-pxi_11-5-rgb_front this guys got a big job because he is got more receivers to his side
08pdycn-pxi_12-5-rgb_front so he is got to cheat to the strong side of the field where there are the majority of the receivers
08pdycn-pxi_13-5-rgb_front and this guy got to try to pick up to see if they are slipping anybody out of the backfield
08pdycn-pxi_14-5-rgb_front or if this wide receiver is going to cut off on a short route then this linebackers going to step up
08pdycn-pxi_15-5-rgb_front so he is got the outside responsibilities the middle linebacker has got anything back here
08pdycn-pxi_16-5-rgb_front but the main thing is once they read a pass they got to get in a back peddle pick up the quarterbacks eyes and then find somebody to cover
08pdycn-pxi_17-5-rgb_front and that is how you play linebacker dropping back in pass coverage
08pdycn-pxi_2-5-rgb_front now most of the time if you are running a defense you are running against a team that runs about as much as they pass
08pdycn-pxi_3-5-rgb_front so these linebackers have to be very athletic and very versatile to be able to adjust to whatever is going on
08pdycn-pxi_4-5-rgb_front so the first responsibility any time the ball is snapped is our linebackers have to take a step up they have to search the gaps they have to pick up to see whether to run the play or if its going to be a pass play
08pdycn-pxi_5-5-rgb_front and they are going to be reading the quarterback
08pdycn-pxi_6-5-rgb_front if the quarterback plays action fakes a lot of time the linebackers are going to sucked up another step
08pdycn-pxi_7-5-rgb_front so these guys have to be able to react quick
08pdycn-pxi_8-5-rgb_front if it s not a fake and the quarterback starts a drop back
08pdycn-pxi_9-5-rgb_front these guys first of all have to know their assignments
08udcmpntyu_0-5-rgb_front one arm row the goal of the exercise is to work posterior delt rhomboids and lats
08udcmpntyu_1-5-rgb_front so it is just kind of like you are starting a lawnmower is how i like to refer to it
08udcmpntyu_2-5-rgb_front make sure that you have got a good stable wide stance knee in line with the ankle do not show the chair the knee forward in front of the toe
08udcmpntyu_3-5-rgb_front we are going to bring it down slightly on the diagonal and our goal is to inhale and exhale and draw that elbow right up to the side to where we feel contraction back here we do not want to feel the shoulder try to compress to the ear we want to leave that nice and flat so inhale and boom right there put it right back here control it down
08udcmpntyu_4-5-rgb_front you are working against gravity here so it is a great exercise
08udcmpntyu_5-5-rgb_front make sure that your hand is above the knee joint on the supporting leg
08udcmpntyu_6-5-rgb_front working to reps sets on each side
08hx7lrgpzq_0-5-rgb_front hi i am kelli i am an aesthetician and a makeup artist at ulta salon and cosmetics and i am going to show you how you can apply a powder foundation
08hx7lrgpzq_1-5-rgb_front you have a couple of different ways that you can apply a powder foundation depending on how much coverage you want
08hx7lrgpzq_10-5-rgb_front so you can just see the difference between the two sides of her face lighter coverage fuller coverage
08hx7lrgpzq_11-5-rgb_front so those are two ways you can apply powder foundation
08hx7lrgpzq_2-5-rgb_front for a fuller coverage you would want to apply it with a sponge
08hx7lrgpzq_3-5-rgb_front for a lighter coverage you would want to apply it with a brush
08hx7lrgpzq_4-5-rgb_front so just to demonstrate going to do a lighter coverage on one half of her face and a darker coverage on the other half
08hx7lrgpzq_5-5-rgb_front so we are just going to dust this all over using a brush
08hx7lrgpzq_6-5-rgb_front just even out her skin tone
08hx7lrgpzq_7-5-rgb_front so you can see it gives her some coverage but it does not necessarily give her a really full coverage
08hx7lrgpzq_8-5-rgb_front so if i want a fuller coverage i am going to use a sponge
08hx7lrgpzq_9-5-rgb_front the sponge is going to pickup more pigment and in turn give a fuller coverage
08nsvhzlnfe_0-5-rgb_front hi i am joe cuenco with family resources
08nsvhzlnfe_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to be talking about not to live the rest of our life alone
08nsvhzlnfe_10-5-rgb_front do you want to be with somebody is who a university professor
08nsvhzlnfe_11-5-rgb_front do you want to work with somebody or be with somebody who is maybe in the architectural trades
08nsvhzlnfe_12-5-rgb_front or somebody is who involved in sports
08nsvhzlnfe_13-5-rgb_front perhaps you need to find somebody is who is who is a marathoner because those things are important to you
08nsvhzlnfe_14-5-rgb_front but you really need to really need to take a look at what your your life styles are and try and match those up with your potential partner
08nsvhzlnfe_15-5-rgb_front the first part is really doing an introspective look in improving your own self confidence
08nsvhzlnfe_16-5-rgb_front that comes from educating yourself being the best person that you can be and making sure that you radiate that self confidence
08nsvhzlnfe_17-5-rgb_front you need to find somebody that has the relationship fundamentals down
08nsvhzlnfe_18-5-rgb_front somebody who is going to love you you can trust communicate with you respect you and be your friend for life
08nsvhzlnfe_19-5-rgb_front and if these things are not there then you are really going to have a difficulty or difficult time moving the relationship relationship to the next level
08nsvhzlnfe_2-5-rgb_front specifically how to choose a partner for life
08nsvhzlnfe_20-5-rgb_front the other thing is find somebody who is going to treat you special
08nsvhzlnfe_21-5-rgb_front do the little things for you
08nsvhzlnfe_22-5-rgb_front brig you a cup of coffee in the morning
08nsvhzlnfe_23-5-rgb_front a martini at night
08nsvhzlnfe_24-5-rgb_front or a beer while you are watching a football game
08nsvhzlnfe_25-5-rgb_front or rub her shoulder or rub her feet
08nsvhzlnfe_26-5-rgb_front put gas in her car
08nsvhzlnfe_27-5-rgb_front make her eel very special
08nsvhzlnfe_28-5-rgb_front the other thing you need to take a look at is is what level of interaction takes place with the family
08nsvhzlnfe_29_30_31-5-rgb_front can you get along with the family that is an important important thing what are your short term goals your long term goals
08nsvhzlnfe_3-5-rgb_front well just how do we choose a partner or life
08nsvhzlnfe_32-5-rgb_front what does your retirement look like
08nsvhzlnfe_33-5-rgb_front do you want children
08nsvhzlnfe_34-5-rgb_front so you have to be aligned from that view point because if you are not then you are going to this discongruity is going to create problems for you later on down the road
08nsvhzlnfe_35-5-rgb_front so share the same goals
08nsvhzlnfe_36-5-rgb_front share the same goals in terms of your life life style but also you need to take a look at at cultural aspect
08nsvhzlnfe_37-5-rgb_front relationship work shops are very helpful here
08nsvhzlnfe_38-5-rgb_front family resources puts those on
08nsvhzlnfe_39-5-rgb_front and so this is how we learn how to choose a partner for life
08nsvhzlnfe_4-5-rgb_front well i wish i could say that it is just as ease as going behind isle in a grocery store but it is it is not that that that easy
08nsvhzlnfe_40-5-rgb_front i am joe cuenco with family resources relationships for life
08nsvhzlnfe_5-5-rgb_front the first thing we really need to do is take a look in the mirror
08nsvhzlnfe_6-5-rgb_front we really need to do an introspective look and say who are we from an inventory perspective
08nsvhzlnfe_7-5-rgb_front what do we want short term long term and then approach it from there
08nsvhzlnfe_8-5-rgb_front you really need to think about who we would like to be matched up with long term that is very similar to our short term goals and our long term goals and who we really are
08nsvhzlnfe_9-5-rgb_front are you looking to be with a professional
097l3r1jcfq_0_1-5-rgb_front and we are making chili verde we have got our chili verde sitting right there not boiling out of control it just is cooking let it be

097l3r1jcfq_14-5-rgb_front you can get some that you can that are not cooked
097l3r1jcfq_15-5-rgb_front you just take them they are already made and you can cook them yourself
097l3r1jcfq_16-5-rgb_front i like to do that but today we have just got some regular flour tortillas
097l3r1jcfq_17-5-rgb_front we got ten of them
097l3r1jcfq_2-5-rgb_front okay we have got out cabbage we got our lime on the side here we got that

09b_3nbfom8_0-5-rgb_front pain is one of those things that we see a lot of patients for as an acupuncturist and its probably what its best known for
09b_3nbfom8_1-5-rgb_front its funny i sometimes i get a phone call how much do you charge for elbow pain
09b_3nbfom8_10-5-rgb_front we may ask some more interesting questions
09b_3nbfom8_11-5-rgb_front we might say where on your arm exactly does it hurt because we have those lines of energy that run along the arms and legs in the body and so depending on exactly where your pain is in a particular place of your arm may guide us towards a particular organ or a particular area
09b_3nbfom8_12-5-rgb_front then there is things like is it better with massage or worse than massage
09b_3nbfom8_13-5-rgb_front is there a color associated with that pain
09b_3nbfom8_14-5-rgb_front so all of these are the types of questions your practitioner should be asking you and if you can give them good feedback on that you will get the best fastest treatment to alleviate you of any pains that you may have
09b_3nbfom8_2-5-rgb_front and what is important in chinese medicine is to know that everything is done through diagnostics
09b_3nbfom8_3_4-5-rgb_front so whilst most people would just think ehh my knee hurts my back hurts fix it there is much more to it than that
09b_3nbfom8_5-5-rgb_front some of the more important questions we ask in order to do good diagnostics on what type of pain and what is the best treatment approach are things like what makes it better or worse
09b_3nbfom8_6-5-rgb_front so we may say does cold make it better or does cold make it worse
09b_3nbfom8_7-5-rgb_front does heat help
09b_3nbfom8_8-5-rgb_front is it better with exercise or worse with exercise
09b_3nbfom8_9-5-rgb_front is there certain movements that are uncomfortable
09gn-xezujg_0-8-rgb_front what are the benefits of tutoring
09gn-xezujg_1-8-rgb_front the benefits of tutoring are for well okay
09gn-xezujg_10-8-rgb_front that is a pretty big responsibility though so you have to make sure that you you know that it that it makes sense that it is pretty
09gn-xezujg_11-8-rgb_front that is the benefit to tutoring as a job
09gn-xezujg_2-8-rgb_front there is the benefit to the student getting to learn things and then there is the benefit to the tutor getting to make a living
09gn-xezujg_3-8-rgb_front but also as opposed to any other job let is say the tutor gets to make his own hours a little bit more than most other people
09gn-xezujg_4-8-rgb_front so there is easier scheduling
09gn-xezujg_5-8-rgb_front there is easier scheduling
09gn-xezujg_6-8-rgb_front there is a decent pay usually
09gn-xezujg_7-8-rgb_front a lot of times if there is a middle man involved your pay cut is pretty steep but then your middle man is getting you getting you clients so that is a that you have to make sometimes
09gn-xezujg_8-8-rgb_front it is also a pretty fun job if you like explaining things and it makes you feel smart
09gn-xezujg_9-8-rgb_front there is also the ego boost of having your having your paradigm your thought pattern you know put out into the world and adopted by somebody else
09kiqmdcskc_0-8-rgb_front now that the face is done we are going to move on to the eyes
09kiqmdcskc_1-8-rgb_front this is the fun part and the hard part
09kiqmdcskc_10-8-rgb_front that is just going to give a really creamy cream look
09kiqmdcskc_11-8-rgb_front it is going to be like drawing on a white piece of paper when i am done
09kiqmdcskc_12-8-rgb_front the next color i put on is going to go on so smooth and look beautiful
09kiqmdcskc_13-8-rgb_front this is just a very very natural look

09kiqmdcskc_19-8-rgb_front whatever i do on top i normally do a little bit on the bottom just so that it is all blended and smooth looking
09kiqmdcskc_2-8-rgb_front the first step is eye shadow base
09kiqmdcskc_20-8-rgb_front close again
09kiqmdcskc_21-8-rgb_front if you get a little powder dust underneath just clean it up with a brush
09kiqmdcskc_22-8-rgb_front now i am ready to put the lid color on
09kiqmdcskc_3-8-rgb_front that is really easy
09kiqmdcskc_4-8-rgb_front you can not mess this up
09kiqmdcskc_5-8-rgb_front you want to take a nice big brush
09kiqmdcskc_6-8-rgb_front i am not using something so shimmery because i am using a lot of shimmer on the rest of her face so i am using a very matte kind of nude neutral vanilla color
09kiqmdcskc_7-8-rgb_front it is so natural that you do not have to worry about using too much
09kiqmdcskc_8-8-rgb_front you just really want to pile it on
09kiqmdcskc_9-8-rgb_front i am taking it right to her eye and i am just putting it all over the whole entire lid

09pimpqifau_13-8-rgb_front if it gets to a point where it is just not going through because maybe you have pulled the wire too tight
09pimpqifau_14-8-rgb_front if you push the crochet hook all the way up through the loop it will make it a little bit bigger so it will make it easier to get through

09pimpqifau_6-8-rgb_front we have added one single stitch to the end of the second row and now we are going to flip over the bracelet and go back the other way
09pimpqifau_7-8-rgb_front what we do is put our hook into the first loop

09wc1lfk_p4_5-8-rgb_front you could do a buffet or station style
09wc1lfk_p4_6-8-rgb_front in that you could do like a raw bar setup on blocks of ice or you can do ice sculpture that is part of a center piece of a buffet with like your seafood adorning that
09wc1lfk_p4_7-8-rgb_front but mainly most of the time for an elegant beach theme wedding you are probably going to do a seated dinner
09wc1lfk_p4_8-8-rgb_front for appetizer of course you could start off with like a lobster bisque or crab cakes and then roll into your salad
09wc1lfk_p4_9-8-rgb_front and then for your entree you could do a surf and turf whether it be steak and shrimp or steak and lobster
0acei3_jn3k_0_1_2_3-8-rgb_front hi i am amy erinberger i am with option model management i have been a commercial model for many many years some of the tools that a model needs always are for the ladies you need to have a bag
0acei3_jn3k_10-8-rgb_front being comfortable with yourself is a huge tool
0acei3_jn3k_11-8-rgb_front confidence is a major benefit to your work
0acei3_jn3k_12-8-rgb_front so bring that with you on every job you have
0acei3_jn3k_13-8-rgb_front and be consistent
0acei3_jn3k_14-8-rgb_front get to know your clients
0acei3_jn3k_15-8-rgb_front make that get them to know you a little bit so they feel comfortable working with you
0acei3_jn3k_16-8-rgb_front you will often be asked to bring certain shoes maybe a pair of heels that blend in with your skin or a pair of heels that are black something that will work with the clothing or even individual clothing items themselves
0acei3_jn3k_17-8-rgb_front this will always be clear in advance of a job
0acei3_jn3k_18-8-rgb_front but having a wardrobe is a nice thing to present yourself and also because you may need it from time to time on your shoots
0acei3_jn3k_19-8-rgb_front other tools i would say i think i might have covered most of it
0acei3_jn3k_20-8-rgb_front oh i know that women are required to have nude underwear and men as well
0acei3_jn3k_21-8-rgb_front you need to have something that is not going to be very visible under the clothing
0acei3_jn3k_22-8-rgb_front it is especially important for women because you will wear much more thin fabrics and things like that so you have to have nude thongs and bras
0acei3_jn3k_23-8-rgb_front something that some people may not expect when they get into modeling but it is important
0acei3_jn3k_4-8-rgb_front you need to be able to do full and hair whenever the client requests it
0acei3_jn3k_5-8-rgb_front this is a common request
0acei3_jn3k_6-8-rgb_front especially lately it seems like not as many clients are budgeting for hair and artists
0acei3_jn3k_7-8-rgb_front so be prepared to know how to do this yourself
0acei3_jn3k_8-8-rgb_front and men you should know how to make your hair look good and take care of your skin and teeth just like women do
0acei3_jn3k_9-8-rgb_front inner beauty i talked about earlier but that is a really important thing
0al_w4fp-va_0-8-rgb_front training for football
0al_w4fp-va_1-8-rgb_front single leg lateral hop
0al_w4fp-va_10-8-rgb_front you can work ten to fifteen reps per leg so you can work anywhere from twenty to thirty reps for the set
0al_w4fp-va_11-8-rgb_front and then next we are going to do single leg forward hops
0al_w4fp-va_2-8-rgb_front jonsey is going to demonstrate what we mean by single leg lateral hop which is going to work stability for you and also power
0al_w4fp-va_3-8-rgb_front okay
0al_w4fp-va_4-8-rgb_front he is going to start on one foot he is going to jump to the side onto the other foot and stabilize himself by landing only on one foot and then jump back and forth
0al_w4fp-va_5-8-rgb_front so when we are beginning this exercise and your series of exercises on the single leg we want to take this approach of going from one leg to the other and then we are going to work in a variation
0al_w4fp-va_6-8-rgb_front do you want to show them the single leg where we do not alternate
0al_w4fp-va_7-8-rgb_front so now we are not going to alternate legs he is going to still jump to the side laterally but land on the same leg
0al_w4fp-va_8-8-rgb_front this exercise is going to be a lot harder so when working with this exercise work for anywhere from eight to twelve reps on this one leg before switching over to the other leg
0al_w4fp-va_9-8-rgb_front if you are alternating legs you can work on a different rep scheme
0azfdfnzrog_0-8-rgb_front tip number personal taste
0azfdfnzrog_1-8-rgb_front of course the most important thing in choosing any form of style whether it is clothing a hairstyle makeup or in this case jewelry is your personal taste
0azfdfnzrog_2-8-rgb_front what you like is the most important thing
0azfdfnzrog_3-8-rgb_front if you like something and somebody tells you it does not look good on you unless you really really trust their opinion just ignore it
0azfdfnzrog_4-8-rgb_front because really if you like something chances are you are going to feel confident in it and be able to pull off the look
0azfdfnzrog_5-8-rgb_front then again if you do not like something and you are only wearing it perhaps because it was a gift or a family heirloom chances are you are not going to enjoy wearing it as much as if you liked it
0azfdfnzrog_6-8-rgb_front because jewelry is so diverse you do not really have to stick with a certain style all the time
0azfdfnzrog_7-8-rgb_front personal taste is absolutely up to you completely subjective and the most important guideline in picking out your jewelry
0ahtd4uppjq_0-5-rgb_front i do not want you to think to get an impression that feng shui is all about the rules and about the elements
0ahtd4uppjq_1-5-rgb_front so what you also got to do you have to feel the energy there
0ahtd4uppjq_10-5-rgb_front you want to play some music burn some candles open the windows once in a while to let that fresh chi come in
0ahtd4uppjq_11-5-rgb_front so this way you create a movement of energy in the area and this way energy does is not stagnant
0ahtd4uppjq_2-5-rgb_front what kind of energy is in the room
0ahtd4uppjq_3-5-rgb_front so if for example if there is clutter in the room the energy is definitely not good enough
0ahtd4uppjq_4-5-rgb_front it is too ying so it is stagnant
0ahtd4uppjq_5-5-rgb_front you want to clear that clutter
0ahtd4uppjq_6-5-rgb_front so if there is certain like heavy piece of furniture or piece of furniture that you do not like is in the southeast that is not not going to give you a very good supportive energy also
0ahtd4uppjq_7-5-rgb_front so another thing that you you want to look you want to see do you use the room often enough
0ahtd4uppjq_8-5-rgb_front even if it is a beautiful room but you do not use it often enough so the energy becomes stagnant
0ahtd4uppjq_9-5-rgb_front so what you want to do is to move the energy
0c16xfubt3c_0-3-rgb_front hi
0c16xfubt3c_10-3-rgb_front another part is you have your turn table the wheels
0c16xfubt3c_11-3-rgb_front you are going to remove this as well because for the most part it is clean
0c16xfubt3c_12-3-rgb_front you have got it protected by the glass turn table most of the time so you do not have to worry about this being cleaned
0c16xfubt3c_13-3-rgb_front you also do not want to use harsh chemicals on it
0c16xfubt3c_14-3-rgb_front not that we are going to but you just want to keep it as clean as possible
0c16xfubt3c_15-3-rgb_front we are going to remove it and set it to the side
0c16xfubt3c_16-3-rgb_front we have left our microwave
0c16xfubt3c_17-3-rgb_front you see we have got some crumbs on the inside here so we are going to just kind of sweep those out while we get ready for our next step
0c16xfubt3c_2-3-rgb_front before we start cleaning it is always important to remove removable parts
0c16xfubt3c_3-3-rgb_front generally you do not want to keep your metal rack in your microwave unless you are using it
0c16xfubt3c_4-3-rgb_front it can cause problems with the microwave
0c16xfubt3c_5-3-rgb_front after we finish cleaning this we are going to put it away instead of keeping it in our microwave
0c16xfubt3c_6-3-rgb_front let is take this out
0c16xfubt3c_7-3-rgb_front next you are going to take out the glass tray which enables everything to work on the turn table
0c16xfubt3c_8-3-rgb_front this definitely needs some cleaning
0c16xfubt3c_9-3-rgb_front we are going to clean that separately
0c6tsfqie_y_0-8-rgb_front hitman blood money is a registered trademark of io interactive a company which with i have no affiliation
0c6tsfqie_y_1-8-rgb_front okay so we just saved our game because the hardest part of the level is actually the very first part and it is one of the six gang members that we have to take out and his walking toward us here and what we want to do is literally just push him over the rail as he walks pass
0c6tsfqie_y_2-8-rgb_front but the thing is we have to get him close enough to the rail just by kind of nudging him that we can push him in one go without having to initiate the head budded attack which makes noise and makes a blood stain and that likely get attention
0c6tsfqie_y_3-8-rgb_front so we would just want kind of start walking towards him and nudge him over towards the rail
0c6tsfqie_y_4-8-rgb_front so we want to get this guy close enough to the rail that we can just push him over and take him out in one go and there we done it and it has to be done quickly because some of the other sailors come around the corner like that guy right there
0c6tsfqie_y_5-8-rgb_front so if you do not do it in a matter of about one second you will actually have to start a fight with the guy and it might be a gun shot and that sailor almost guaranteed to catch you
0c6tsfqie_y_6-8-rgb_front you could alternatively not kill that guy right now and try to get him later but that is more trouble than it is worth
0c6tsfqie_y_7-8-rgb_front so it worth trying to get that right right out of the gate since it is the very first thing you do in the mission and then that is one least guy you have to worry about
0c9r7xjhuuo_0-8-rgb_front so now you have a bike
0c9r7xjhuuo_1-8-rgb_front it is something that you had in your basement or you bought it at a yard sale you did not get ripped off at a flea market
0c9r7xjhuuo_10-8-rgb_front if you look at the the rim as i mentioned earlier this this is a true antique
0c9r7xjhuuo_11-8-rgb_front it is got a wooden rim but look at that rim
0c9r7xjhuuo_12-8-rgb_front this bike even in this condition should not be repainted
0c9r7xjhuuo_13-8-rgb_front this original paint is worth more like this than it would be if it were repainted
0c9r7xjhuuo_14-8-rgb_front over here you see the head badge
0c9r7xjhuuo_15-8-rgb_front it is a brass head badge it is got porcelain in it
0c9r7xjhuuo_16-8-rgb_front even though the porcelain is chipped it is not worth trying to restore that or fix that
0c9r7xjhuuo_17-8-rgb_front this bike even with all this scaling rust what you should do is clean it up and we will talk about that in another series but what you should do is clean it up
0c9r7xjhuuo_18-8-rgb_front the general rule is it is only original once and it is rarely worth the time and the cost to repaint a bike
0c9r7xjhuuo_2-8-rgb_front now you have a bike that you want to do some work on
0c9r7xjhuuo_3-8-rgb_front so the question is do you restore it or do you recondition it
0c9r7xjhuuo_4-8-rgb_front it is only original once
0c9r7xjhuuo_5-8-rgb_front the best way to ruin the value of a bike is to over restore it
0c9r7xjhuuo_6-8-rgb_front repainting will kill a bike is value unless it is an excellent job and it will never be worth the cost to do that kind of a job
0c9r7xjhuuo_7-8-rgb_front you have to find decals silk screens there is so many things that you have to find after repainting a bike that it is it is rarely worth it unless it is something like this
0c9r7xjhuuo_8-8-rgb_front now this thing looks terrible
0c9r7xjhuuo_9-8-rgb_front the paint is all flaking off obviously there is funky stuff going on everywhere
0cat2qlicco_0-8-rgb_front to really get people to really pay attention to your presentation bring up themselves
0cat2qlicco_1-8-rgb_front everybody likes it when they talk about themselves
0cat2qlicco_10-8-rgb_front so there you have it elements in our daily lives
0cat2qlicco_11-8-rgb_front your periodic table
0cat2qlicco_12-8-rgb_front simple presentations some decorations and do not get me wrong you can add to it up here
0cat2qlicco_13-8-rgb_front you can put little things here you might even put a little up there but anything to make it interesting or three dimensional
0cat2qlicco_14-8-rgb_front you might even put the man up here but there you have
0cat2qlicco_15-8-rgb_front it is just a very simple science presentation
0cat2qlicco_2-8-rgb_front you might want to first start off with
0cat2qlicco_3-8-rgb_front hey do you want to know what you re made out of
0cat2qlicco_4-8-rgb_front you re made out of six elements per say that are from the table of elements the periodic table that is
0cat2qlicco_5-8-rgb_front did you know that there is oxygen in your body
0cat2qlicco_6-8-rgb_front did you know that you have carbon hydrogen nitrogen calcium and phosphorous
0cat2qlicco_7-8-rgb_front all those different combinations make up a human being which is you and oh by the way your an animal
0cat2qlicco_8-8-rgb_front did you know that
0cat2qlicco_9-8-rgb_front so if you point that out to people and show them what your all made out of it is quite a interesting spectrum and it makes you so human it really does

0cpt0o-r-70_0-8-rgb_front the next step in doing a hand massage is for you and your client to sanitize your hands
0cpt0o-r-70_1-8-rgb_front you want to use an improved hand sanitizer or you want to use soap and warm water
0cpt0o-r-70_10-8-rgb_front the best way to do that is by keeping your hands clean
0cpt0o-r-70_11-8-rgb_front that is how you sanitize your hands
0cpt0o-r-70_2-8-rgb_front make sure that you rub the fronts real good the backs of the hands also go ahead and rub the wrists
0cpt0o-r-70_3-8-rgb_front make sure that it is nice and clean
0cpt0o-r-70_4-8-rgb_front if you need a little extra hand sanitizer go ahead and put some in
0cpt0o-r-70_5-8-rgb_front if you are using your sink you always want to make sure you wash your hands for at least a full thirty seconds to a minute
0cpt0o-r-70_6-8-rgb_front once you are hand sanitizer dries up you know you have used it all
0cpt0o-r-70_7-8-rgb_front again this one is
0cpt0o-r-70_8-8-rgb_front it is what we are using today but if you have access to soap and water it is best to go ahead and use that
0cpt0o-r-70_9-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that if you have an open wound or if your client has a cut on her hand already that she is not going to get infection in it
0csauzm2jau_0-5-rgb_front so if your going to be walking with your dog on leash in the woods there is a couple of different kinds of leashes you can use
0csauzm2jau_1-5-rgb_front one important thing you want to find out is if your in public property you going to want to know what the regulations are
0csauzm2jau_2-5-rgb_front there are some places that have a maximum of leash length of feet and if that is the case you want to have a leash thats approximately this long
0csauzm2jau_3-5-rgb_front this is actually a nifty kind of a leash this leash actually has a collar attached right to it and i show you how this works this means you just have one piece so you have the leash attached to the collar
0csauzm2jau_4-5-rgb_front you fit it on the dog like that and you can just slide the keeper close so it fits right around the dogs neck
0csauzm2jau_5-5-rgb_front this way if the dog is walking nicely with you the leash is comfortable and relaxed and if they we are to pull it will actually close to fit around the size of the size of the dogs neck
0csauzm2jau_6-5-rgb_front so this will be a good walking leash if your walking in a place there is a regulation about what size it has to be
0csauzm2jau_7-5-rgb_front if not you can give your dog a little bit more freedom by using a flexier retractable leash
0cx_8jyojdc_12-8-rgb_front i am just going to follow this around to the back section of his head and then when i get ready to do this next corner then next side i am going to start on this side and then come to the front and i am gong to work my way back
0cx_8jyojdc_13-8-rgb_front stay tune for our next segment which i am going to give you a tip on how to blend the longer side into the clipper part
0c_njylthwc_0-8-rgb_front okay so now that we have our button off
0c_njylthwc_1-8-rgb_front we have our needle threaded
0c_njylthwc_10-8-rgb_front and just pull it
0c_njylthwc_11-8-rgb_front and you know what
0c_njylthwc_12-8-rgb_front if you yanked it really hard i bet it would just come right out
0c_njylthwc_13-8-rgb_front oh no it does not
0c_njylthwc_14-8-rgb_front sometimes it will do that
0c_njylthwc_15-8-rgb_front you just yank it
0c_njylthwc_16-8-rgb_front see like that
0c_njylthwc_17-8-rgb_front it will come out
0c_njylthwc_18-8-rgb_front and that is okay
0c_njylthwc_19-8-rgb_front that is no big deal
0c_njylthwc_2-8-rgb_front now i am going to show you how to sew this button on
0c_njylthwc_20-8-rgb_front that just means you need to maybe grab a little bit below that hole and come out through the top hole
0c_njylthwc_21-8-rgb_front so just kind of bypass one hole
0c_njylthwc_22-8-rgb_front and now it will not come out
0c_njylthwc_23-8-rgb_front it is stuck in there really good
0c_njylthwc_24-8-rgb_front so we do not want the knot on the back
0c_njylthwc_25-8-rgb_front we just want it on the front
0c_njylthwc_26-8-rgb_front just pinch a little piece
0c_njylthwc_27-8-rgb_front and now we are ready to put the thread through the first hole of the button
0c_njylthwc_28-8-rgb_front hold it still like this and just put it through one side
0c_njylthwc_29-8-rgb_front you can run it all the way through and a lot of people make the mistake of forgetting to put it through the second hole and going straight for the fabric
0c_njylthwc_3-8-rgb_front and we can see the holes from where it was before
0c_njylthwc_30-8-rgb_front do not do that
0c_njylthwc_31-8-rgb_front what you want to do is put it through the second hole
0c_njylthwc_32-8-rgb_front and there it is
0c_njylthwc_33-8-rgb_front and i am just going to hold the button and just gently slide it down the thread to where it is fitting right there and then i am going to go look where i have the knot and just go right below the knot and stick it through to the other side
0c_njylthwc_34-8-rgb_front just do one side at a time
0c_njylthwc_35-8-rgb_front now we do not have to do any more catching the front and the back
0c_njylthwc_36-8-rgb_front so if you look at the back you have the first initial loop
0c_njylthwc_37-8-rgb_front you just want to put your needle right where the top loop is
0c_njylthwc_38-8-rgb_front where it goes in and it comes right out the top hole
0c_njylthwc_39-8-rgb_front and if it does that that is okay
0c_njylthwc_4-8-rgb_front and another thing that we want to do before we even get started you will look at the other buttons
0c_njylthwc_40-8-rgb_front you just pull it down
0c_njylthwc_41-8-rgb_front there you go
0c_njylthwc_42-8-rgb_front and now we are going to do this again
0c_njylthwc_43-8-rgb_front and i like to put it in then turn it over and look at the back side at the same time
0c_njylthwc_44-8-rgb_front so i can make sure that it comes out right where the thread is
0c_njylthwc_45-8-rgb_front and if you do not get the threads right on top of each other it is okay
0c_njylthwc_46-8-rgb_front it does not make a difference
0c_njylthwc_47-8-rgb_front it is going to look good no matter what
0c_njylthwc_48-8-rgb_front and then again you put it right on top where the thread goes in on top out the top
0c_njylthwc_49-8-rgb_front we are almost finished
0c_njylthwc_5-8-rgb_front and i can see that the thread is going vertical on this on these buttons not horizontal sideways
0c_njylthwc_50-8-rgb_front i like to do maybe three or four runs through it before i tie it off
0c_njylthwc_51-8-rgb_front there we go
0c_njylthwc_52-8-rgb_front and you can look and see if it looks the same width
0c_njylthwc_53-8-rgb_front i think i am going to do one more
0c_njylthwc_54-8-rgb_front to get the same amount of thread on this button as the other button
0c_njylthwc_55-8-rgb_front we want it to look uniform
0c_njylthwc_56-8-rgb_front here we go
0c_njylthwc_57-8-rgb_front and i think that is just going to be perfect
0c_njylthwc_58-8-rgb_front so now what i am going to do i want to turn it over and i am going to tie a knot on the back
0c_njylthwc_59-8-rgb_front and it is the same type of knot that you tied when you tied off the needle and thread
0c_njylthwc_6-8-rgb_front so i want to make sure that i sew this button on with the holes top to bottom
0c_njylthwc_60-8-rgb_front so what i am going to do is hold this hold the thread that is coming from the button
0c_njylthwc_61-8-rgb_front get the needle just wrap it around
0c_njylthwc_62-8-rgb_front and you just hold onto this
0c_njylthwc_63-8-rgb_front and you can pull the thread that has the needle and just keep pulling it and pulling it
0c_njylthwc_64-8-rgb_front put your thumb right on top at this point and just keep pulling it and the knot just lowers itself right around the back of the button
0c_njylthwc_65-8-rgb_front so i have got one knot and i want to put another one
0c_njylthwc_66-8-rgb_front i like to make sure that that button is going to stay on there
0c_njylthwc_67_68_69-8-rgb_front so you pull put your thumb on top pull away and now i am going to clip the thread i am just going to clip it maybe like a fourth of an inch from the knot
0c_njylthwc_7-8-rgb_front okay so what we want to do is find the holes where they were before
0c_njylthwc_70-8-rgb_front there we go
0c_njylthwc_71-8-rgb_front and now we that button sewn on
0c_njylthwc_72-8-rgb_front and i am going to put it through the button hole just to make sure everything is lining up and looks right
0c_njylthwc_73-8-rgb_front okay
0c_njylthwc_74-8-rgb_front there we go
0c_njylthwc_75-8-rgb_front that is simple as that
0c_njylthwc_76-8-rgb_front and that is how you sew on a button that has two holes
0c_njylthwc_77-8-rgb_front and next i am going to show you how to sew on a button that has four holes
0c_njylthwc_8-8-rgb_front and just i am going to run the needle through the bottom hole and i am just going to pinch a little piece and come out through the top
0c_njylthwc_9-8-rgb_front just like that
0ca0mc1sqpa_0-8-rgb_front waste not what not ends up being a good directive and it can lead to some exciting art
0ca0mc1sqpa_1-8-rgb_front this is a print a print is a piece of art that has been replicated
0ca0mc1sqpa_10-8-rgb_front what i did with this one was i tore it rather than cutting it because the edges of the piece of paper were themselves not cut but had a decal edge is what they call the rougher edges of paper
0ca0mc1sqpa_11-8-rgb_front i just tore them in irregular strips and when i laid them out i found a really cool rhythm starting to build up
0ca0mc1sqpa_2-8-rgb_front in other words i had it says two of six down here i made six prints of this you pull a print
0ca0mc1sqpa_3-8-rgb_front this is a
0ca0mc1sqpa_4-8-rgb_front i found that it got a little too black and once it gets too black there is not a lot you can do with it
0ca0mc1sqpa_5-8-rgb_front ink is permanent you can not take it off you can not erase it it is there
0ca0mc1sqpa_6-8-rgb_front so i had these six pieces of paper it is very nice quality paper
0ca0mc1sqpa_7-8-rgb_front i like the quality of the blacks and i really like some of the texture of the washes that happened but the design itself is not doing a whole lot
0ca0mc1sqpa_8-8-rgb_front what are you going to do with your art
0ca0mc1sqpa_9-8-rgb_front you can take pieces that do not work for you and see if you can bring them together in another way to make a piece of art
0ceclzxqzz4_1-8-rgb_front your feet will actually become like your hands like playing baseball basketball whatever you just get used to the ball so it comes right at you
0ceclzxqzz4_2-8-rgb_front when they say dribbling or the defender is on a breakaway watch him go what he is doing as he goes on the field is he is dribbling the ball from one foot to the other from one foot
0ceclzxqzz4_3-8-rgb_front he might switch and use the outside of his foot to do a little fake come to the other side maybe use the outside of his foot again
0ceclzxqzz4_4-8-rgb_front ok so this will be a little demonstration of me dribbling the ball
0ceclzxqzz4_5-8-rgb_front so i will set here i will have the ball i will be dribbling around i might kick it with my right foot i might kick it with my left i might switch it back i might kick it between my leg and spin it on the defender
0ceclzxqzz4_6-8-rgb_front you know whatever it may take i might fake it and go back to the outside step over it again well basically you are just sitting there you are keeping control you are watching the ball you know where the ball goes itself
0ceclzxqzz4_7-8-rgb_front and that is what they call dribbling
0ceclzxqzz4_8-8-rgb_front just like in basketball basketball players use their hands
0ceclzxqzz4_9-8-rgb_front soccer players use their feet

0dr03wvvqti_0-8-rgb_front today we are going to talk about how to pick out and care for a good celery plant
0dr03wvvqti_1-8-rgb_front this one right here it looks pretty good

0dr03wvvqti_14-8-rgb_front it is going to make them a lot bigger
0dr03wvvqti_15-8-rgb_front it should help them grow faster
0dr03wvvqti_16-8-rgb_front you definitely want to look at the tags on these because it is going to tell you how long it is going to take for them to grow and how much space you should put in between them
0dr03wvvqti_17-8-rgb_front this one says about six to eight inches in between
0dr03wvvqti_18-8-rgb_front so they are going to get a little big so you want to give them a little bit of room to grow
0dr03wvvqti_19-8-rgb_front and you can plant them in any kind of basic potting mix or garden soil
0dr03wvvqti_2-8-rgb_front it is got a plant in each little spot for the four pack
0dr03wvvqti_20-8-rgb_front if you are going to put them in the ground you definitely want to use soil if you are going to put them in a container use a good potting mix
0dr03wvvqti_3-8-rgb_front you really want to look for that

0dr03wvvqti_5-8-rgb_front it looks pretty green there is no black spots or yellow on any of the leaves or anything
0dr03wvvqti_6-8-rgb_front that one looks really good right there
0dr03wvvqti_7-8-rgb_front this particular variety takes ninety to one hundred and twenty days to fully mature
0dr03wvvqti_8-8-rgb_front so you want to get them started pretty early in the season
0dr03wvvqti_9-8-rgb_front you have to plant these in full sun and you have to water them
0du7wwlk-qu_0-8-rgb_front hi
0du7wwlk-qu_1-8-rgb_front i am dr eric sayer from sayer family chiropractic
0du7wwlk-qu_10-8-rgb_front you will cause other problems
0du7wwlk-qu_11-8-rgb_front ice for the first hours
0du7wwlk-qu_12-8-rgb_front minutes on and an hour off
0du7wwlk-qu_13-8-rgb_front it is common also to go to heat after the first hours
0du7wwlk-qu_14-8-rgb_front stay with ice pretty strictly for the first hours
0du7wwlk-qu_15-8-rgb_front after that a combination treatment works very well
0du7wwlk-qu_16-8-rgb_front minutes of ice minutes of heat and then take an hour off
0du7wwlk-qu_17-8-rgb_front the way i explain is it is just a way to shock the body into healing that part of itself faster
0du7wwlk-qu_18-8-rgb_front the heat also is a way to bring new blood and nutrition to the area so it helps the person heal but not during the first hours
0du7wwlk-qu_3-8-rgb_front in this segment we are going to be talking about ice to treat strained backs
0du7wwlk-qu_4-8-rgb_front definitely just ice for minutes take an hour off
0du7wwlk-qu_5-8-rgb_front it is very simple
0du7wwlk-qu_6-8-rgb_front you place it on the injured area
0du7wwlk-qu_7-8-rgb_front do not leave it too long otherwise you are cause other types of problems
0du7wwlk-qu_8-8-rgb_front the other thing is after is that after any type of strain you want to be icing for the first hours
0du7wwlk-qu_9-8-rgb_front do not go directly to heat
0dgty_nna48_0-5-rgb_front alright we are ready to move on to roman numeral ii dramatic action
0dgty_nna48_1-5-rgb_front and we are going to look at a first
0dgty_nna48_10-5-rgb_front the major conflict is the inner struggle between his psychiatrist to make him normal or let him be free
0dgty_nna48_11-5-rgb_front that is the major conflict
0dgty_nna48_12-5-rgb_front and that is what everything in the play all the decisions in the play are about this one major issue that has to resolved within the play
0dgty_nna48_13-5-rgb_front and sometimes it takes a little while to find that major conflict
0dgty_nna48_14-5-rgb_front so you may know it may be obvious you may have it right now or you may want to come back to it
0dgty_nna48_2-5-rgb_front and a is major conflict over question mark
0dgty_nna48_3-5-rgb_front now sometimes you may have to come back to this
0dgty_nna48_4-5-rgb_front the major conflict is what is the biggest conflict in the play
0dgty_nna48_5-5-rgb_front what drives the whole play
0dgty_nna48_6-5-rgb_front every play every movie every character has major conflict which is the big one and a lot of little minor conflicts along the way
0dgty_nna48_7-5-rgb_front but when you are analyzing a play you have to answer what is the major conflict
0dgty_nna48_8-5-rgb_front i am going to jump back to equus
0dgty_nna48_9-5-rgb_front in equus the major conflict is not that alan blinded the horses and is in trouble
0dhj9bk49rm_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about how to clean a trophy
0dhj9bk49rm_1-8-rgb_front and basically what we are going to use we got a little trophy here that is got a little dust on it it is been sitting on the shelf for a while
0dhj9bk49rm_10-8-rgb_front now the walnut itself is going to get a little dusty and you might want to use just some ordinary household furniture polish which you can find anywhere
0dhj9bk49rm_11-8-rgb_front and just apply a little bit to your again we use a paper towel you can use a soft cloth if you wish and just a little bit of the furniture polish not very much
0dhj9bk49rm_12-8-rgb_front then just very gently wipe the dust off and rub the furniture polish into the wood and it will give it a nice shine and look as good as new
0dhj9bk49rm_2-8-rgb_front actually there are more ways not to clean a trophy than there are to clean a trophy
0dhj9bk49rm_3-8-rgb_front what we are going to use is just your basic household paper towel
0dhj9bk49rm_4-8-rgb_front and we are going to use a cleaning solution which is basically your average window cleaner
0dhj9bk49rm_5-8-rgb_front we try not to use anything with any alcohol or any solvent in it
0dhj9bk49rm_6-8-rgb_front and we do not want to spray it directly onto to trophy we want to spray it onto our cloth and then just very gently wipe off the dust
0dhj9bk49rm_7-8-rgb_front there is not much on here but the important thing is not to use any harsh solvent and just wipe the dust off gently
0dhj9bk49rm_8-8-rgb_front and that is all there is to that
0dhj9bk49rm_9-8-rgb_front certain types of trophies are going to require of course a little bit more special care such as this cup with a solid walnut base
0dqrsiqf4py_0-8-rgb_front hi i am bobby larew
0dqrsiqf4py_1-8-rgb_front right now we are going to focus on our legs
0dqrsiqf4py_10-8-rgb_front what you are going to do from here is jump
0dqrsiqf4py_11-8-rgb_front as you jump you are just going to squeeze your feet together
0dqrsiqf4py_12-8-rgb_front when you come back down to the floor again spread the legs
0dqrsiqf4py_13-8-rgb_front okay i am going to demonstrate for you
0dqrsiqf4py_14-8-rgb_front second if you have got a chair around or maybe some stairs you can do a couple of stair raises
0dqrsiqf4py_15_16-8-rgb_front very simple put your left foot up on the chair or the stair and all your going to do is push up
0dqrsiqf4py_17-8-rgb_front okay i would alternate in sets on both these exercises doing three sets of about twenty
0dqrsiqf4py_18-8-rgb_front alright and those are just a few things you can do to strengthen your leg muscles
0dqrsiqf4py_2-8-rgb_front when it comes to strength conditioning a lot of people think the calves are the most important part of jumping
0dqrsiqf4py_3-8-rgb_front they are not
0dqrsiqf4py_4-8-rgb_front it is actually this part of your legs right here
0dqrsiqf4py_5-8-rgb_front that is why michael jordan can jump so well
0dqrsiqf4py_6-8-rgb_front so i have got a couple of things that you can do to strengthen your leg muscles
0dqrsiqf4py_7-8-rgb_front alright first thing and my favorite is just squat jumps
0dqrsiqf4py_8-8-rgb_front when you do a squat jump you want your feet about shoulder width apart
0dqrsiqf4py_9-8-rgb_front okay you are going to lower yourself down keeping your back straight pushing the butt to the floor
0dv5umfvqv8_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is elliot kwong
0dv5umfvqv8_2-8-rgb_front so what if i want to learn how to do jumps
0dv5umfvqv8_3-8-rgb_front i recommend that you start with something small maybe like a garden hose
0dv5umfvqv8_4-8-rgb_front you place it on the ground and you practice jumping over it
0dv5umfvqv8_5-8-rgb_front here we have a garden hose
0dv5umfvqv8_6-8-rgb_front we are just going to put this on the ground right here
0dv5umfvqv8_7-8-rgb_front so what you can do before you jump over the hose is just try jumping with you and the scooter
0dv5umfvqv8_8-8-rgb_front and when you jump try to keep your feet with the board so that when you are feet jump so does the board and the feet stay with the board they jump together
0e4mkywahos_0-8-rgb_front hi
0e4mkywahos_1-8-rgb_front i am simone fisher and i am here at clearwater ice arena in sunny clearwater florida
0e4mkywahos_3-8-rgb_front hi
0e4mkywahos_4-8-rgb_front my name is bill shanks and i am going to demonstrate for you a half lutz jump
0e4mkywahos_5-8-rgb_front when doing a half lutz jump what you are doing is you are taking off from the left outside back edge and the right toe
0e4mkywahos_6-8-rgb_front you are going to jump turn one half rotation in the air from here
0e4mkywahos_7-8-rgb_front you are going to jump up and land on the opposite toe and step forward
0e4mkywahos_8-8-rgb_front this is how it goes
0ebzunzdv9a_0-8-rgb_front well in order for the colony to be full of brood and honey and nectar and the eggs the queen has laid it takes a couple of months for that to happen
0ebzunzdv9a_1-8-rgb_front the queen can lay to eggs in a day so she is really active this time of the year especially
0ebzunzdv9a_2-8-rgb_front you get to the springtime of the year and the colony is expanding
0ebzunzdv9a_3-8-rgb_front the queen wants to lay a lot of eggs so the colony will be strong for the summer
0ebzunzdv9a_4-8-rgb_front in the spring up north for instance if you start a beehive with a package of bees and you can buy packaged bees about for a package of bees three pounds of bees with a queen you do that in the spring like in april or may and then by the time you do that in early april by the time you get to june and things start blooming the colony has some pretty good strength if you have fed then and they are in good condition
0evlxax_-vw_0-11-rgb_front o k we are talking about motorcycle safety and safety equipment and different options that you have
0evlxax_-vw_1-11-rgb_front let is get a little more in depth with you on safety equipment and your options
0evlxax_-vw_10-11-rgb_front they are very very very very strictly regimented track race safety material
0evlxax_-vw_11-11-rgb_front i brought them out just because i thought they would be fun for you to look at and then give you a little bit more information on what you are looking at when it comes to safety gear and what you can look for to buy when you are ready for the track
0evlxax_-vw_2-11-rgb_front these are what is called a racing suit
0evlxax_-vw_3-11-rgb_front they are for advanced riders
0evlxax_-vw_4-11-rgb_front they are a full race suit two piece race suit actually
0evlxax_-vw_5-11-rgb_front you have different options but they are strictly leather
0evlxax_-vw_6-11-rgb_front we have a perforated leather over here for you to show you and a full leather
0evlxax_-vw_7-11-rgb_front they do zip at the waist
0evlxax_-vw_8-11-rgb_front they do have your full body armor on them
0evlxax_-vw_9-11-rgb_front and that is from wrist to above elbow and from below elbow to shoulder and a full back plate with full leg plate full knee part on them which means that you have your knee armor
0ew2ql96ksc_0-8-rgb_front we are going over how to take measurements to have a custom dress made
0ew2ql96ksc_1-8-rgb_front and the next measurement that we are going to go over is the shoulder to waist measurement
0ew2ql96ksc_10-8-rgb_front this helps when if you are not exactly certain where the most narrowest part of your waist is
0ew2ql96ksc_11-8-rgb_front going from shoulder to belly button will also help
0ew2ql96ksc_2-8-rgb_front this will help the designer know or pattern maker whoever is making your dress know actually how long your torso is
0ew2ql96ksc_3-8-rgb_front some people are a little bit longer torso than others some are a little bit shorter
0ew2ql96ksc_4-8-rgb_front what you want to do is go a head and mark with a you can mark it with a string or some pins exactly where you take the waist measurement from which is the narrowest point of your body
0ew2ql96ksc_5-8-rgb_front just go a head and make sure that you have marked evenly
0ew2ql96ksc_6-8-rgb_front the next this will head you being able to take shoulder to waist measurement
0ew2ql96ksc_7-8-rgb_front now you will go from the top of the shoulder at an angle to the center of the waist measurement or the center of the waist
0ew2ql96ksc_8-8-rgb_front now this will give you the proper measurement
0ew2ql96ksc_9-8-rgb_front sometimes seamstresses will ask for shoulder to belly button
0exgsf1yn-0_0-8-rgb_front all right in this section i am going to explain to you step five of the breath stroke
0exgsf1yn-0_1-8-rgb_front now this is going to be your upper body that you are going to use
0exgsf1yn-0_10-8-rgb_front so when you are doing it it is going to be just like this okay
0exgsf1yn-0_11-8-rgb_front so you are in prayer position
0exgsf1yn-0_12-8-rgb_front this is your starting point right here
0exgsf1yn-0_13-8-rgb_front not open hands not out like this just really close to the body tight in prayer position
0exgsf1yn-0_2-8-rgb_front what you are going to want to do is your hands are going to want to be not you are going to want them actually closed and in a prayer position
0exgsf1yn-0_3-8-rgb_front and you are going to be like this right in the center of your chest so not in the lower part of your chest and not up here just right on the center
0exgsf1yn-0_4-8-rgb_front so again closed hands no open gaps right prayer position thumbs in like this and then you are just aiming like in the chest
0exgsf1yn-0_5-8-rgb_front so you are going to be like this when you are doing breath stroke to start off in prayer position
0exgsf1yn-0_6-8-rgb_front and that is step five when you are beginning the breath stroke
0exgsf1yn-0_7-8-rgb_front in this section of the breath stroke it is a continuation of step five and it is going to be the way you are going to place your hands
0exgsf1yn-0_8-8-rgb_front so again remember no open hands make sure that they are closed like prayer position and it is close to the chest okay
0exgsf1yn-0_9-8-rgb_front so when you start off doing breath stroke i showed you how to do your legs and you want to make sure that your arms are like this under the water
0ezaw5v-lfu_1-11-rgb_front alright so what your going to do to get started is just step on the machine and it is okay if it starts to sink not a problem
0ezaw5v-lfu_2-11-rgb_front you can either press any of the workouts the quick starts usually my favorite and then you just start stepping
0ezaw5v-lfu_3-11-rgb_front now for every machine is different so you just have to take the first couple of seconds to see whether you want to increase your levels which will increase the intensity
0ezaw5v-lfu_4-11-rgb_front usually meaning the speed but you can also decrease as well for this machine you can press different numbers to figure out how many calories you have burn how fast your going how many flights of stairs you have done as well as the distance that you gone
0ezaw5v-lfu_5-11-rgb_front press stop when your done and just letting it sink to the bottom carefully step off making sure you do not trip on anything and that is it
0e_eli0d4na_1-8-rgb_front mulching your perennial border is a important thing for a couple of different reasons one it helps to stop weeds from approaching
0e_eli0d4na_10-8-rgb_front so think about things that you can use around your yard or around your house
0e_eli0d4na_11-8-rgb_front i often use my compose as mulch in my vegetable gardens
0e_eli0d4na_12-8-rgb_front even ripped up newspapers can work great cause the mulch in your vegetable garden will help keep weeds down
0e_eli0d4na_13-8-rgb_front remember why we are using the mulch if it is just to make it look good then you are going to want to spend some money
0e_eli0d4na_14-8-rgb_front but if you are just looking to keep weeds down then hay even black plastic is going to go a long way for keeping your garden mulch
0e_eli0d4na_2-8-rgb_front as you can see here we got some weeds that are starting to creep in the garden
0e_eli0d4na_3-8-rgb_front well one of the ways that we can help discourage that is a with a good healthy coating of mulch
0e_eli0d4na_4-8-rgb_front we just shake some mulch out in the area spread it around because i do not have too many plants right here i can put it down in a fairly thick level
0e_eli0d4na_5-8-rgb_front that is really going to help surprise the weeds and even the grass from growing back into that area
0e_eli0d4na_6-8-rgb_front i am using cider mulch here cause it is near my house but you can use lots of other different types of mulch
0e_eli0d4na_7_8-8-rgb_front out here in my back yard i have a liberal supplied of pine needles thanks for the pine tree i put over my hedge here these guys are not so much use to here in the north east but i know a lot of people down south are really fond of using my needles and you can even find them in a bag mulch down here
0e_eli0d4na_9-8-rgb_front but my thought is make even with the sunshine and middest well make pine needles mulch when the pine needles drop them
0ehqlujx9q8_0-3-rgb_front hi my name is lauren and today i am going to discuss how to spike thick hair
0ehqlujx9q8_1-3-rgb_front spiking thick hair because of the heaviness of it will start when you first get your hair cut
0ehqlujx9q8_10-3-rgb_front so you can kind of spike everything up using these hard hold gels
0ehqlujx9q8_11-3-rgb_front you can also use hard hold hair sprays in order to get them to stay
0ehqlujx9q8_12-3-rgb_front there is also a corporation called spiker is gel which make a bit of the stronger hold gels in order to help maintain and help coarser hair and fuller and thicker hair stand up and actually spike
0ehqlujx9q8_13-3-rgb_front and that is how to spike coarse hair
0ehqlujx9q8_2-3-rgb_front there is something called thinning shears or notching shears and they actually have these little serrated edges on the one side
0ehqlujx9q8_3-3-rgb_front so it actually just simply removes bulk from the hair
0ehqlujx9q8_4-3-rgb_front if you have your stylist use these once you are trying to style your hair and spike it it will remove some of that weight and make your job easier
0ehqlujx9q8_5-3-rgb_front now once you are at home what you are going to do is use a blow dryer and blow your hair straight up as far up as you can get it
0ehqlujx9q8_6-3-rgb_front there are heavier products that you want to use
0ehqlujx9q8_7-3-rgb_front some are a little bit more thread like and kind of help it attach
0ehqlujx9q8_8-3-rgb_front also you can use very hard gels
0ehqlujx9q8_9-3-rgb_front you want something with strong hold in order to really keep the spikes up and to work with that little bit of that coarser fuller hair style
0ejxicfqrko_0-8-rgb_front so our next exercise is very similar to what we just did the plank
0ejxicfqrko_1-8-rgb_front we are going to add on to that and it is going to be the around the world pushups
0ejxicfqrko_10-8-rgb_front bring your nose towards the mat
0ejxicfqrko_11-8-rgb_front press up on the left side and all the way up
0ejxicfqrko_12-8-rgb_front so you are making a big circle so you can get all into those shoulders and get those cuts
0ejxicfqrko_13-8-rgb_front again left side
0ejxicfqrko_14-8-rgb_front come over
0ejxicfqrko_15-8-rgb_front press down
0ejxicfqrko_16-8-rgb_front bring your nose to the center
0ejxicfqrko_17-8-rgb_front press and lift all the way up
0ejxicfqrko_18-8-rgb_front good again
0ejxicfqrko_19-8-rgb_front so you are going to go around the world on the right side
0ejxicfqrko_2-8-rgb_front so you are going to come onto your hands and knees just like you did before
0ejxicfqrko_20-8-rgb_front hinge over
0ejxicfqrko_21-8-rgb_front good
0ejxicfqrko_22-8-rgb_front bend down
0ejxicfqrko_23-8-rgb_front bring your nose through the center
0ejxicfqrko_24-8-rgb_front press up on the left side and back in
0ejxicfqrko_25-8-rgb_front again
0ejxicfqrko_26-8-rgb_front now you are going to reverse it
0ejxicfqrko_27-8-rgb_front bring to the left
0ejxicfqrko_28-8-rgb_front press down all the way
0ejxicfqrko_29-8-rgb_front bring that nose to that mat
0ejxicfqrko_3-8-rgb_front wide wide hands
0ejxicfqrko_30-8-rgb_front press
0ejxicfqrko_31-8-rgb_front exhale to lift
0ejxicfqrko_32-8-rgb_front so you brought this important here
0ejxicfqrko_33-8-rgb_front use your breath
0ejxicfqrko_34-8-rgb_front one more right
0ejxicfqrko_35-8-rgb_front down through center
0ejxicfqrko_36-8-rgb_front press and lift and again
0ejxicfqrko_37-8-rgb_front and left
0ejxicfqrko_38-8-rgb_front down through center and down
0ejxicfqrko_39-8-rgb_front so if you are not as strong as mark is here you can bend your knees down and do girl pushups and do it the same exact way
0ejxicfqrko_4-8-rgb_front same rules apply
0ejxicfqrko_40-8-rgb_front so keep those hips forward
0ejxicfqrko_41-8-rgb_front again bend over towards the right side
0ejxicfqrko_42-8-rgb_front come down through center
0ejxicfqrko_43-8-rgb_front press up for left and lift
0ejxicfqrko_44-8-rgb_front still keeping the navel scooped in
0ejxicfqrko_45-8-rgb_front keeping the shoulders pressed away from the ears and press all the way up
0ejxicfqrko_46-8-rgb_front press back to child is pose
0ejxicfqrko_47-8-rgb_front give yourself a good stretch
0ejxicfqrko_48-8-rgb_front heels towards the butt
0ejxicfqrko_49-8-rgb_front our next clip will be arabesque pulls
0ejxicfqrko_5-8-rgb_front extend those legs out so you are in your push up position
0ejxicfqrko_6-8-rgb_front so from here it is going to start with that rock
0ejxicfqrko_7-8-rgb_front you are going to rock towards the right side
0ejxicfqrko_8-8-rgb_front stay on that right side
0ejxicfqrko_9-8-rgb_front you are going to push down
0esq_tac-1y_0-5-rgb_front another tool that is very handy when you are working with a coated breed dog is scissors
0esq_tac-1y_1-5-rgb_front lot of different types of scissors
0esq_tac-1y_10-5-rgb_front make sure that the scissors are balanced and comfortable in your hand
0esq_tac-1y_11-5-rgb_front these scissors can be used for trimming around the eyes trimming around the face trimming around the feet
0esq_tac-1y_12-5-rgb_front it is important that you have got a comfortable pair that is manageable in your hand
0esq_tac-1y_13-5-rgb_front they do make left handed scissors
0esq_tac-1y_14-5-rgb_front again i am left handed but i have learned to do everything with right hand
0esq_tac-1y_15-5-rgb_front for those of you who are left handed and really need to be left handed they do make left handed scissors and so you can find them
0esq_tac-1y_16-5-rgb_front another pair of scissors we have got here are the thinning shears
0esq_tac-1y_17-5-rgb_front again you want to get a pair that is comfortable in your hand
0esq_tac-1y_18-5-rgb_front there is many different types
0esq_tac-1y_19-5-rgb_front this type of thinning shear has the tines cut into the blade on one side and the other side as you can see is just the blade it is flat
0esq_tac-1y_2-5-rgb_front i am going to show you types
0esq_tac-1y_20-5-rgb_front you can use on different parts of the dog
0esq_tac-1y_21-5-rgb_front again when you are working around the face working on the feet
0esq_tac-1y_22-5-rgb_front you would really have no reason to cut the body hair but if you are not showing your dog and you do want to trim up some of it then this would give you a more natural look than if you just used the straight shears which would just cut a blunt end
0esq_tac-1y_23-5-rgb_front most dog breeds when you are showing them should not be scissored
0esq_tac-1y_24-5-rgb_front it happens but they should not be
0esq_tac-1y_25-5-rgb_front if you have got a dog at home and you just want to trim some of the coat off then scissors can be very handy to use
0esq_tac-1y_26-5-rgb_front important when you are getting scissors make sure they are comfortable in your hands that the blade is a good quality and you can get them sharpened
0esq_tac-1y_27-5-rgb_front depending on how much you use them you ought to get them sharpened about once a year
0esq_tac-1y_28-5-rgb_front you do not want to be pulling or breaking the dog is coat when you are using them on the coat
0esq_tac-1y_3-5-rgb_front this is just your straight regular scissors
0esq_tac-1y_4-5-rgb_front it is actually a straight blade
0esq_tac-1y_5-5-rgb_front it is a relatively straight blade in this type of scissor
0esq_tac-1y_6-5-rgb_front depending on what you are comfortable working with you can get longer bladed scissors
0esq_tac-1y_7-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that when you are picking out your scissors you try a bunch of different pair and make sure that the action is comfortable and smooth
0esq_tac-1y_8-5-rgb_front this a nice pair of scissors
0esq_tac-1y_9-5-rgb_front these scissors are probably years old
0fdg59g2-si_1-2-rgb_front now we are on to the next step
0fdg59g2-si_10-2-rgb_front it is a whole grain rice as you can see here
0fdg59g2-si_11-2-rgb_front what is nice about jasmine rice is it is got nice flavor
0fdg59g2-si_12-2-rgb_front it cooks relatively easily and evenly
0fdg59g2-si_13-2-rgb_front first thing we need to do is take our rice and rinse it
0fdg59g2-si_14-2-rgb_front it is important to always rinse your rice
0fdg59g2-si_15-2-rgb_front because when you are cooking rice you want to remove any of the excess starch that may have occurred when the rice has been rubbing against itself in shipment
0fdg59g2-si_16-2-rgb_front just going to set that aside and let it drain
0fdg59g2-si_17-2-rgb_front in the mean time in our pot we are going to add an equal amount of water
0fdg59g2-si_18-2-rgb_front with jasmine rice it is one part water to one part rice
0fdg59g2-si_19-2-rgb_front i am cooking a cup and a half of rice so i need a cup and a half of boiling water
0fdg59g2-si_2-2-rgb_front now we are going to prepare one of the condiments to go with our salmon and today that is rice
0fdg59g2-si_20-2-rgb_front and we take our element turn it up to max let the water boil
0fdg59g2-si_21-2-rgb_front in the mean time let is make sure that we have drained our rice thoroughly
0fdg59g2-si_3-2-rgb_front now there is many different kinds of rice
0fdg59g2-si_4-2-rgb_front every country in the world practically grows rice where there is any kind of a warm tropical climate
0fdg59g2-si_5-2-rgb_front today i have decided to choose jasmine rice
0fdg59g2-si_6-2-rgb_front jasmine rice is a thai rice
0fdg59g2-si_7-2-rgb_front comes from thailand
0fdg59g2-si_8-2-rgb_front it is a little more flavorful
0fdg59g2-si_9-2-rgb_front it is kind of the part of the family of sweet rices
0fqav67tdew_1-11-rgb_front so a very good way of helping yourself to remember your dreams better on a consistent basis is to keep a dream journal
0fqav67tdew_2-11-rgb_front so i would advise you to if you do not already have one go out and by yourself a nice little book or something that you can have as your dream journal
0fqav67tdew_3-11-rgb_front make this something very special because again when your dreams realize that you are paying attention to them you are taking notice of them you will find that they will come more and you will be able to remember them more easily
0fqav67tdew_4-11-rgb_front so you get that dream journal you put it by your bed
0fqav67tdew_5-11-rgb_front if you can find a pen with a little flashlight or a little light on it so that you can have those two things by your bed anytime and start keeping that journal of your dreams
0fqav67tdew_6-11-rgb_front you might find that there are some things which you dream about on a consistent basis like recurring dreams or you might take note of what certain symbols mean to you personally
0fqav67tdew_7-11-rgb_front so we will be talking little bit more and analyzing a specific dream in the next few clips
0frdek0kbzg_0-1-rgb_front hello i am robert nizza with the bti group in san francisco
0frdek0kbzg_1-1-rgb_front the topic today is selling your small business
0frdek0kbzg_10-1-rgb_front please do not work with people that do not have experience with transactions
0frdek0kbzg_11-1-rgb_front if it is a family lawyer or a family account that never does business deals it is exactly like going to a foot doctor to have brain surgery
0frdek0kbzg_12-1-rgb_front you want to work with people skilled with transactions so number one is determining what is the value of your business
0frdek0kbzg_13-1-rgb_front number two would be hiring a business broker or perhaps an attorney somebody like that that has transaction experience having a contract with that person to represent you
0frdek0kbzg_14-1-rgb_front that person will then package your business
0frdek0kbzg_15-1-rgb_front what is the vital information for your business
0frdek0kbzg_16-1-rgb_front are there some financial statements
0frdek0kbzg_17-1-rgb_front hopefully there are because it is very hard for a buyer to get interested in the business if there is no numbers for the business
0frdek0kbzg_18-1-rgb_front are there any special permits or are there any leases
0frdek0kbzg_19-1-rgb_front is it a retail store that is highly dependent on the lease
0frdek0kbzg_2-1-rgb_front this is quite a wide topic so i am just going to give you some bullet points to start off with
0frdek0kbzg_20-1-rgb_front what are the lease amounts
0frdek0kbzg_21-1-rgb_front those can go into the package
0frdek0kbzg_22-1-rgb_front if it is a liquor store or a bar or something like that that requires an abc license that of course should be in the package
0frdek0kbzg_23-1-rgb_front once the package is complete now your representative is ready to show your business to buyers so as a business broker i would advertise your business on a bunch of websites that i know
0frdek0kbzg_24-1-rgb_front i would also tell my fellow agents about your business so that they can tell the people that they know all in a confidential way about your business
0frdek0kbzg_25-1-rgb_front get them excited about it
0frdek0kbzg_26-1-rgb_front then if we do get a buyer we write an offer
0frdek0kbzg_27-1-rgb_front once the offer is agreed upon people agree on the price and the various terms and contingencies then we go through the due diligence process and if that goes well you can close the deal
0frdek0kbzg_28-1-rgb_front those are the real steps to selling your small business
0frdek0kbzg_3-1-rgb_front probably the most important thing by far including price or whatever is your true motivation for wanting to sell the business
0frdek0kbzg_4-1-rgb_front are you just looking to get money
0frdek0kbzg_5-1-rgb_front or are you looking to retire
0frdek0kbzg_6-1-rgb_front spend more time with the grandkids
0frdek0kbzg_7-1-rgb_front rent a sailboat and go around the caribbean for a few months
0frdek0kbzg_8-1-rgb_front your true motivation is a key thing because the last thing you want to do is not be motivated and get into a deal only to back out of the deal at the last minute so assuming you are motivated the first thing you probably want to do is go to a person that you trust to start thinking about what is the business worth
0frdek0kbzg_9-1-rgb_front i strongly recommend talking to people that have a lot of experience not just one deal in the last ten years or even three deals in the last ten but somebody who works in the industry so either a business broker or a transaction attorney an accountant who has a lot of experience with transactions
0fs8a5vglxc_0-8-rgb_front we are going to come into the sidekick
0fs8a5vglxc_1-8-rgb_front now this one really works the shoulders but i am also going to be massaging the inside of the leg
0fs8a5vglxc_2-8-rgb_front so first thing you want to do is lift up the leg and you do want it long you want a knee to be not locked but engaged
0fs8a5vglxc_3-8-rgb_front and i am going to start slowly making circles
0fs8a5vglxc_4-8-rgb_front this is going to show me how far out i can take that leg
0fs8a5vglxc_5-8-rgb_front so i am going to slowly roll it down and then when i see okay that is how far she can go without pushing it too long i kind of rest her leg in the crook of my foot right there
0fs8a5vglxc_6-8-rgb_front i am going to take this hand steady here fingertips pointing down as i start palming the inside of that thigh back and forth feels really nice
0fs8a5vglxc_7-8-rgb_front now you are not squeezing you are just gentle pressure down perfect
0fs8a5vglxc_8-8-rgb_front hand underneath the knee hand underneath the heel and gently bring it in
0ft9brex_g0_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to be talking about contraindications for hot stone massage
0ft9brex_g0_1-8-rgb_front as in any other body work there are contraindications
0ft9brex_g0_10-8-rgb_front and anyone that is trying to get hot stone should know that some conditions are contraindicated
0ft9brex_g0_11-8-rgb_front next we will be talking about the benefits of hot stone
0ft9brex_g0_2-8-rgb_front and for hot stone here is as follows
0ft9brex_g0_3-8-rgb_front anyone with high blood pressure taking any medication that might react with heat open wounds or sores inflamed skin conditions diabetes and neuropathy which is numbness and tingling of the peripherals
0ft9brex_g0_4-8-rgb_front also contraindicated is pregnancy
0ft9brex_g0_5-8-rgb_front during pregnancy a hormone called relaxin is increased which lengthens and softens the tissue of the body and prepares it for birth
0ft9brex_g0_6-8-rgb_front the increased heat from the stones and the deep tissue work can further lengthen these tissues making it problematic for after birth when the tissues are trying to shorten
0ft9brex_g0_7-8-rgb_front as a therapist you should be very thorough in your intake process
0ft9brex_g0_8-8-rgb_front learn as much as you can about the client is health history
0ft9brex_g0_9-8-rgb_front and telling you this is helping us educate people about hot stone
0g41fmdf9by_1-11-rgb_front you know public speaking is one of those items that so many people get afraid of
0g41fmdf9by_2-11-rgb_front there is such a fear to public speaking
0g41fmdf9by_3-11-rgb_front but today what we are going to do is address some of the different things that you can do
0g41fmdf9by_4-11-rgb_front for example you can be a corporate speaker which would go into the actual corporate offices and you are involved in doing training programs or you are just doing motivational speaking or helping the others raise up their expectations
0g41fmdf9by_5-11-rgb_front the other type is network speaking where you are going to be going into networking mixers and you will be there and you will be your keynote speaker and you may have to speak anywhere from minutes to minutes just depending on the venue that you are working with
0g41fmdf9by_6-11-rgb_front and then you have of course associations and clubs and all the other varieties of speaking
0g41fmdf9by_7-11-rgb_front the ultimate in public speaking would be if you are a keynote speaker that travels into a major hotel to where you will have thousands of people in the audience and you will be the one on stage that is there to move them through a journey in public speaking
0g4ggozbqpo_0-8-rgb_front ok we are going to go ahead and take off the rubber band and we are going to just follow along the line of our part
0g4ggozbqpo_1-8-rgb_front now when it comes to these spiral braids it can be a little bit tricky on keeping your braid centered
0g4ggozbqpo_10-8-rgb_front once you have that done you just have to follow along the lines
0g4ggozbqpo_2-8-rgb_front so what we want to do is just make sure we keep grabbing from the outside and then grabbing from the middle
0g4ggozbqpo_3-8-rgb_front so right now we are grabbing from the very outside and just adding to it
0g4ggozbqpo_4-8-rgb_front but now we want to grab from the stash of hair that is in the middle just to kind of keep it in line
0g4ggozbqpo_5-8-rgb_front and make sure that you are checking the tightness of your braid that is also very important on keeping it aligned
0g4ggozbqpo_6-8-rgb_front but it is just like any other braid you just grab and go under you just grab and go under
0g4ggozbqpo_7-8-rgb_front and as we will go back you see how the braid is staying in the middle
0g4ggozbqpo_8-8-rgb_front and we are just going to go along here and create a nice swirl
0g4ggozbqpo_9-8-rgb_front the key to this is strictly in the parting
0gjk5oid0pa_0-3-rgb_front hi my name is rachel and i am the owner of austinstylewatch com street fashion site and i am also a freelance fashion reporter and today we are going to talk about how to choose the right neck line for your body
0gjk5oid0pa_1-3-rgb_front so first we are going to go over a couple of different types of necklines
0gjk5oid0pa_10-3-rgb_front if you have a long face something like a turtle neck can help make that long face look a little more round
0gjk5oid0pa_11-3-rgb_front if you have a very round face a could kind of help take away from that and bring some length down to it
0gjk5oid0pa_12_13-3-rgb_front so the next thing we are going to talk about i talked about face now we are going to talk about bust so if you are large busted things that work for you are going to be strapless and also the boat neck because the look of the neck attracts to the chest but does not accentuate or minimize it
0gjk5oid0pa_14-3-rgb_front it works well for the area
0gjk5oid0pa_15-3-rgb_front if you are a large busted woman and you have to watch out on this that you do not get it a cut a little too low but a can compliment the bust very well
0gjk5oid0pa_16-3-rgb_front you just have to make sure you do not get anything that cuts down so far that you are having a lot of cleavage showing
0gjk5oid0pa_17-3-rgb_front the also works really well to minimize the shoulders
0gjk5oid0pa_18-3-rgb_front if you have a broad shoulder it kind of always looks like you are wearing shoulder pads a can take the eye down the center of you rather than so much on the shoulders
0gjk5oid0pa_19-3-rgb_front finally we are going to talk a little more on the turtle neck and the turtle neck is another nice one that is a conservative choice for large busted women because it helps cover up a little more
0gjk5oid0pa_2-3-rgb_front first one i am wearing here is a strapless
0gjk5oid0pa_20-3-rgb_front so you get that look there
0gjk5oid0pa_21-3-rgb_front all right so to review you have a boat neck turtle neck and strapless
0gjk5oid0pa_22-3-rgb_front and that is how to match the best neckline with your body
0gjk5oid0pa_3_4_5-3-rgb_front second we are going to talk about here is a it v is down third we are going to talk about is a boat neck and that just kind of cuts from shoulder to shoulder sort of that is kind of look
0gjk5oid0pa_6-3-rgb_front and the final one we are going to talk about today is a turtle neck
0gjk5oid0pa_7-3-rgb_front it goes high up on the neck
0gjk5oid0pa_8-3-rgb_front so these different cuts flatter different types of head shapes face shapes and bust lines
0gjk5oid0pa_9-3-rgb_front so we are going to talk about what is kind of advantageous for each type
0gli2uap2cy_10-8-rgb_front it is funny we care so much more about our cars then our bodies
0gli2uap2cy_11-8-rgb_front you can switch out a car and buy a new car every four years i think the average is and this is the one body i get for this experience this life this is it and so why we do not take more time in choosing what we want to put in it it surprises me
0gli2uap2cy_12-8-rgb_front i am talking about myself as well
0gli2uap2cy_13-8-rgb_front i am going to try and think a little bit more stay a little more present do a little more research before we just put the hamburger in our stomachs and then we do not feel good the rest of the day and we can not figure out why
0gli2uap2cy_14-8-rgb_front everyone that i have introduced raw foods to they say the same thing
0gli2uap2cy_15-8-rgb_front they can not believe that that raw food could taste like this
0gli2uap2cy_16-8-rgb_front i think that they just thought that it was going to be an apple or something
0gli2uap2cy_17-8-rgb_front nothing wrong with an apple but as you can see there is lots more we can do
0gli2uap2cy_1_2_3_4-8-rgb_front okay we are going to add a nice medjool date these are beautiful dates wow they are so sweet and really soft i find that from my own personal experience that when i buy things in volume and i am not a very small little business here and so i do not buy volume very often but i have bought dates in volume
0gli2uap2cy_5-8-rgb_front they just do not seem to have the same flavor as when i buy just a handful of them at my favorite health market
0gli2uap2cy_6-8-rgb_front so that is kind of one of the reasons the expense seems to be so high
0gli2uap2cy_7-8-rgb_front there is a supplier for the restaurants and i will not mention them and they supply almost every restaurant i have ever been in the back room and i find this company name and it is just not quality
0gli2uap2cy_8-8-rgb_front you can taste it and wherever they have cut corners where they could they did
0gli2uap2cy_9-8-rgb_front you can taste the difference
0gpqtw2tlvw_0-8-rgb_front we are getting ready to paint a picture
0gpqtw2tlvw_1-8-rgb_front but to do that you need something to look at as a reference guide
0gpqtw2tlvw_10-8-rgb_front if i want the back view i have one here
0gpqtw2tlvw_11-8-rgb_front so it is nice to have a lot of choices of pictures to choose from because it can make your painting a lot more interesting
0gpqtw2tlvw_12-8-rgb_front you do not want three pictures of three pansies looking right at you
0gpqtw2tlvw_13-8-rgb_front you want a little natural variation like they are when they grow
0gpqtw2tlvw_14-8-rgb_front we see them from all different angles so you have to paint them from all different angles
0gpqtw2tlvw_15-8-rgb_front so when you are picking out a study whether it is flowers or animals or a scenery picture or anything like that you need at least a picture of a painting or a picture of an actual scene to go by
0gpqtw2tlvw_16-8-rgb_front because to sit down and look at a plain bank of porcelain and start painting can be pretty intimidating
0gpqtw2tlvw_17-8-rgb_front so it is just a reference guide
0gpqtw2tlvw_2-8-rgb_front when i am painting flowers i like to use real photographs of flowers because they are much looser and much more natural when they are the real thing
0gpqtw2tlvw_3-8-rgb_front you can also paint from live flowers in a vase
0gpqtw2tlvw_4-8-rgb_front but when you are picking it out a lot of people will find a picture trace it
0gpqtw2tlvw_5-8-rgb_front which you can do that is fine
0gpqtw2tlvw_6-8-rgb_front you can trace it on and then you just paint in the flowers and the leaves
0gpqtw2tlvw_7-8-rgb_front when i am doing flowers i usually do it freehand but i like to have different poses of the flowers to look at
0gpqtw2tlvw_8-8-rgb_front so i have several snapshots and i look through them and if i want a side view of a flower i might use this one
0gpqtw2tlvw_9-8-rgb_front and when i want the front view i might use this one
0gwsyvialiu_0-11-rgb_front okay some of the advantages we are going to prepare this speech ahead of time prior to committing it to memory so this will allow us to devote quite a bit of attention to style
0gwsyvialiu_1-11-rgb_front how do we want to write this
0gwsyvialiu_10-11-rgb_front i am not limited to being just behind the podium
0gwsyvialiu_11-11-rgb_front so those are some of the advantages of speaking from memory
0gwsyvialiu_2-11-rgb_front what is the style that we are going to use to memorize to present this speech
0gwsyvialiu_3-11-rgb_front also you can review and eliminate any potential problems that could come up in the future
0gwsyvialiu_4-11-rgb_front we are writing it out
0gwsyvialiu_5-11-rgb_front we see ahead of time hey i can see how this can be misconstrued or oh i think people will reject that
0gwsyvialiu_6-11-rgb_front so you can fix it ahead of time where those things are harder to fix when you are on your feet
0gwsyvialiu_7-11-rgb_front also by having a speech committed to memory some of the positives include eye contact
0gwsyvialiu_8-11-rgb_front i am not having to look at a paper again kind of like an impromptu so i can make really good eye contact and i can also move around
0gwsyvialiu_9-11-rgb_front i have the freedom to gesture without having to have a piece of paper in my hand or a note card and i can walk around
0gyur-c_keo_0-5-rgb_front standing in the moving water or white water is something you should never try and do
0gyur-c_keo_1-5-rgb_front anytime that you are moving down stream and you are moving past the riverbed you should not try and stand up
0gyur-c_keo_2-5-rgb_front if you try and search for footing when you are unstable and moving the potential of getting a foot caught in between two boulders and then getting into what we call a foot entrapment where that limb is caught and folds you down on your face or even on your back
0gyur-c_keo_3-5-rgb_front and that creates an extremely difficult situation to rescue yourself and others from
0gyur-c_keo_4-5-rgb_front however there are times when you are out there in the river swimming around if you are stable it is okay to stand up
0gyur-c_keo_5-5-rgb_front for example if you swim in behind a large boulder and you get into the eddy as long as you are stable out in the middle there it is okay to search for footing as long as you are not moving around
0gyur-c_keo_6-5-rgb_front likewise on the side of the river where it is shallow and slow moving as long as it is no deeper than your knee you should be okay to stand
0gyur-c_keo_7-5-rgb_front the one other time that it is okay to stand and walk around is if you are conducting a wading maneuver and you are taking it very slowly and carefully
0gyur-c_keo_8-5-rgb_front and this is something we are going to discuss later
0h0_ry2_6wq_0-5-rgb_front now we are going to finish the decoration by filling in the traced outline of the image that we did
0h0_ry2_6wq_1-5-rgb_front the best thing to do is to continue using markers because it works best on the plastic and do not try to use any kind of paints or any kind of thick markers that go on that might weigh the plastic down
0h0_ry2_6wq_10-5-rgb_front they will actually be able to spot it and see it a lot better
0h0_ry2_6wq_11-5-rgb_front so now we have finished putting in the color on our image and we can see what a big difference it makes
0h0_ry2_6wq_12-5-rgb_front so now i have shown you how to finish coloring your kite with permanent markers
0h0_ry2_6wq_2-5-rgb_front the best is to use just standard permanent markers
0h0_ry2_6wq_3-5-rgb_front it goes on great on the plastic
0h0_ry2_6wq_4-5-rgb_front what is good about this step is that it takes a while to do the image obviously depending on what type of image you want to make but it also is very helpful when doing a project and you are on some type of time schedule
0h0_ry2_6wq_5-5-rgb_front so this is a great part of the project that can be easily manipulated
0h0_ry2_6wq_6-5-rgb_front if you wanted the project to be drawn out over a couple hours or break it up into a few days this is really the step that can help you do that by giving them more opportunities to make some type of decoration on the kite
0h0_ry2_6wq_7-5-rgb_front if you want to make it a little quicker what you can do is you can take the plastic yourself and you can make the outline and have it ready for them so all they have to do is just come and fill in the colors
0h0_ry2_6wq_8-5-rgb_front so this step is a key step in the kite making when you are organizing projects for kids or anybody for that matter and it helps you really stick to a type of time schedule that meets your needs
0h0_ry2_6wq_9-5-rgb_front now obviously the more colors you use the nicer the outcome will be and also the nicer effect it will have once it is flying
0h60j0vxtae_0-5-rgb_front so if you are going to fence competitively in a usfa competition that holds true in the united states there are some regulations that differ in europe and other countries but for usfa this is everything you are going to need
0h60j0vxtae_1-5-rgb_front first one mask
0h60j0vxtae_10-5-rgb_front of course your jacket
0h60j0vxtae_11-5-rgb_front your jacket has no minimum regulations as far as how many newtons it needs to have
0h60j0vxtae_12-5-rgb_front but it does have to have a strap at the bottom that used to be optional it is not anymore you need this handy strap
0h60j0vxtae_13-5-rgb_front glove you need one glove
0h60j0vxtae_14-5-rgb_front you might want two gloves
0h60j0vxtae_15-5-rgb_front there are gloves that have velcro cuffs that allow the body cord to pass through so that is not a bad idea
0h60j0vxtae_16-5-rgb_front again you want to size your glove properly before ordering
0h60j0vxtae_17-5-rgb_front your lame a lame in good working order that is going to pass a test
0h60j0vxtae_18-5-rgb_front you need that for foil you also need a sabre one for a sabre
0h60j0vxtae_19-5-rgb_front your plastron you are required extra underarm protection
0h60j0vxtae_2-5-rgb_front the mask has to pass fie regulations that means that first of all the bib has to be sewn in you can not have a snap in bib and it also has to sustain a certain amount of pressure i think its kilograms
0h60j0vxtae_20-5-rgb_front and also if you are a woman your added chest plate added protection
0h60j0vxtae_21-5-rgb_front if you are a man you need that cup not that cup but the right cup
0h60j0vxtae_22-5-rgb_front and other optional equipment is your chest plate for a man
0h60j0vxtae_23-5-rgb_front in addition to these items you need a pair of pants they have to be white
0h60j0vxtae_24-5-rgb_front they have to pass the overlap rule
0h60j0vxtae_25-5-rgb_front you need a pair of socks they have to come up to your shin they have to come up to your pants
0h60j0vxtae_26-5-rgb_front you need a pair of shoes
0h60j0vxtae_27-5-rgb_front you want them to be good and comfortable and to assist you in your athletic endeavors
0h60j0vxtae_28-5-rgb_front and i think that might just be enough
0h60j0vxtae_3-5-rgb_front if it does not sustain a certain amount of pressure when it is being tested at the competition it does not matter if it actually is fie it still does not fly
0h60j0vxtae_4-5-rgb_front so it is not a bad idea to have a spare helmet along with you
0h60j0vxtae_5-5-rgb_front next you need two electric weapons
0h60j0vxtae_6-5-rgb_front i have two epee is here if you are fencing foil obviously you are going to need two electric foils that are in good working order
0h60j0vxtae_7-5-rgb_front you bring two because of course nothing is foolproof and electric weapons like everything else on occasion do occasionally fail
0h60j0vxtae_8-5-rgb_front next two working body cords
0h60j0vxtae_9-5-rgb_front for the same reason bring two with you
0hmtm0ljvl8_0-5-rgb_front hi i am kelli
0hmtm0ljvl8_1-5-rgb_front i am an aesthetician and makeup artist at ultra salon and cosmetics and i am going to give you some tips on how you can fight oily skin
0hmtm0ljvl8_10-5-rgb_front you can also use mattifying products
0hmtm0ljvl8_11-5-rgb_front this is a mattifier
0hmtm0ljvl8_12-5-rgb_front you can actually take this and pat it
0hmtm0ljvl8_13-5-rgb_front i will even just take a little bit and pat it here on her nose
0hmtm0ljvl8_14-5-rgb_front you can even do this over makeup and basically it is just going to help to soak up any shine and keep her really nice and matte all day
0hmtm0ljvl8_15-5-rgb_front and another thing that you can do is use a really good foundation and powders as well
0hmtm0ljvl8_16-5-rgb_front so those are some things that you can do to help fight oily skin
0hmtm0ljvl8_2-5-rgb_front one of the easiest things that you can do to help with oily skin is actually use a really good hydrator
0hmtm0ljvl8_3-5-rgb_front many people with oily skin are really against using a moisturizer and what happens a lot of times is people with oily skin are always using stripping products trying to strip all the oil out of the skin
0hmtm0ljvl8_4-5-rgb_front so in turn what happens then is it strips your skin of all its natural oils and tricks your skin into thinking that it is dry
0hmtm0ljvl8_5-5-rgb_front so in turn your skin actually produces more oil
0hmtm0ljvl8_6-5-rgb_front so you can really balance that out just by using a really good hydrator which is an moisturizer that is going to balance the oil and water content in the skin and help kind of keep that oily skin in check
0hmtm0ljvl8_7-5-rgb_front another thing that you can do is use anything with salicylic acid in it
0hmtm0ljvl8_8-5-rgb_front salicylic acid is a really great product for oily skin
0hmtm0ljvl8_9-5-rgb_front it is a acid helps to pull any impurities out of the pores and helps to control the oil
0hobk-sd2ds_0-5-rgb_front hi i am ann myrick and today we are going to talk about outfitting your powder room
0hobk-sd2ds_1-5-rgb_front this is a small little powder room
0hobk-sd2ds_10-5-rgb_front you want to be sure that your powder room is really clean
0hobk-sd2ds_11-5-rgb_front you want to clean around your toilet you want when people come in friends people are going to this is where your guests are going to go so you want to be sure that your powder room is very clean toilet is cleaned out
0hobk-sd2ds_12-5-rgb_front you want to have extra toilet paper
0hobk-sd2ds_13-5-rgb_front we have a basket in here and the basket i have magazines along with several rolls of toilet paper so if you are having a party and you are in the other room and somebody needs to come in they can find the toilet paper or whatever they need and not have to hunt you down
0hobk-sd2ds_14-5-rgb_front then also fun rug
0hobk-sd2ds_15-5-rgb_front this is a great rug that we found
0hobk-sd2ds_16-5-rgb_front it has a lot of color and it just adds fun zip
0hobk-sd2ds_17-5-rgb_front you want to be sure if you have a rug in your bathroom or wherever you have little throw rugs that they have a rubber gripper on them for the guests or a family member is not going to slide so just go into your powder room and see if there is everything in it that you need to be able to wash your face wash your hands go to the bathroom and just have fun decorating your room
0hobk-sd2ds_18-5-rgb_front this is ann myrick and that is how to outfit your powder room
0hobk-sd2ds_2-5-rgb_front it has a great fun color in it
0hobk-sd2ds_3-5-rgb_front things you want to think about is you want a nice size mirror
0hobk-sd2ds_4-5-rgb_front you want bright lights so people can come in and check their makeup
0hobk-sd2ds_5-5-rgb_front sometimes people will put dimmers in it because they like the mood of a darker powder room also so you could have dimmers in your lights
0hobk-sd2ds_6-5-rgb_front you want to be sure that it has the things that you need in a powder room
0hobk-sd2ds_7-5-rgb_front you want fresh towels a lot of times if you are having a group those little paper towels are nice because you can use it and some people are funny about using the same towel so you could put some of those little paper hand towels out and then just use it and throw it away
0hobk-sd2ds_8_9-5-rgb_front you want to be sure that you have soap i would say in here we have just one of these just little plastic bottles but i would say that for your powder room when you have guests you might want to have just a really nice pretty dispenser because we do not have a lot in this powder room and you do not want a whole lot but what you have in here you want it to be special and pretty so for these little utilitarian bottles you might want to get something that is a little bit nicer
0hpnkfjr1kq_0-5-rgb_front ok ready golf means when you have hit your ball and you are getting ready to hit the next ball whether you are riding in a cart or walking you should already be thinking what you should be doing
0hpnkfjr1kq_1-5-rgb_front so that way when you get to the ball you already have the right club picked out and you are ready to hit the ball
0hpnkfjr1kq_10-5-rgb_front so ready golf is really a serious part of good golf etiquette it means and it is good for your game because you are getting a rhythm and you are not waiting all the time
0hpnkfjr1kq_11-5-rgb_front so be courteous to the people that are behind you and be courteous to your group and be ready to play every time
0hpnkfjr1kq_2-5-rgb_front one of the biggest problems in golf today is people are like well i do not know what club to use so they go and grab twenty different clubs and then they talk with their friends and then they get a swing lesson so golf is taking too much time to play
0hpnkfjr1kq_3-5-rgb_front so if your time is valuable as i think everybody is is be ready to hit the ball when you get to it
0hpnkfjr1kq_4-5-rgb_front and that way you will be hitting the ball you will get a nice rhythm going and the round will be that much faster
0hpnkfjr1kq_5-5-rgb_front so ready golf is a good part of etiquette
0hpnkfjr1kq_6-5-rgb_front so if you are playing with a foursome each player should have their shots already planned in their minds so they all fan out and go to their balls
0hpnkfjr1kq_7-5-rgb_front instead of you go to one player is ball and then you go to the next player is and the player is and the next player is
0hpnkfjr1kq_8-5-rgb_front because every time you waste five minutes time is four shots per hole times eighteen holes you can play it can take you seven hours to play
0hpnkfjr1kq_9-5-rgb_front so who has time for that
0hr9yzvt2f4_0-5-rgb_front upright rows of the cable pulley system is a good way to engage biceps triceps and shoulders
0hr9yzvt2f4_1-5-rgb_front we are going to work on a straight bar here choosing the weight that will fatigue the muscle in ten to fifteen reps
0hr9yzvt2f4_2-5-rgb_front feet are going to be hip width apart slight bend in the elbows and you want your palm the back of your hand and your elbow and your wrist to line up
0hr9yzvt2f4_3-5-rgb_front we are going to contract up with an exhale
0hr9yzvt2f4_4-5-rgb_front we want to pull it so everything is nice and align
0hr9yzvt2f4_5-5-rgb_front there is no reason to come back here we want muscle over momentum in the movement and release
0hr9yzvt2f4_6_7-5-rgb_front big inhale exhale in the contraction boom that is point right there elbows straight out to the side and release keeping a nice contraction in the edge to keep your gravity from pulling you forward or letting the weight pull you backward and release
0hr9yzvt2f4_8-5-rgb_front nice smooth two count up two count down and working ten to fifteen reps one to three sets
0hw3suqbv7g_0_2-5-rgb_front hi next i am going to talk about what makes a good bulb bad the good bad and the ugly when it comes to flower bulbs
0hw3suqbv7g_10-5-rgb_front so mold is not a flower bulb is best friend
0hw3suqbv7g_11-5-rgb_front and mold happens when they get too wet and so it is part of like they are decaying or rotting process
0hw3suqbv7g_12-5-rgb_front this is a peony root that got wet at the farmers market and you can tell it has just got mold all over it
0hw3suqbv7g_13_14_15-5-rgb_front but there is a silver lining most people would say i am throwing it away it is got mold on it but look there is an eye right here on it and it is still good
0hw3suqbv7g_16_17-5-rgb_front so if you threw it away you are losing a even if one of the eyes here is soft and mushy it is no good
0hw3suqbv7g_18_19_20-5-rgb_front so what i just it is still fleshy like a potato i just rip this off cause it is the eyes that matter not the roots and get rid of that and you still have a good plant
0hw3suqbv7g_21_22-5-rgb_front so there is no need to always throw away every single plant you have just because there is little bit of mold mold is not the end of the world
0hw3suqbv7g_23_24-5-rgb_front you can always put a little bit of bleach water on it or you can even dirt i just rub a little bit of dirt on some moldy spots and all of a sudden the bulb seems fine and the bulb itself is not damaged it is just the covering
0hw3suqbv7g_25-5-rgb_front for is see i have got a tulip here and it is got a little bit of a moldy spot but if i rub some dirt on it it seems to come right off
0hw3suqbv7g_26_27-5-rgb_front so actually if i would have went ahead and planted that it would still be just fine so that does not always mean that the bulb is bad even if there is a little bit of mold
0hw3suqbv7g_28-5-rgb_front next watch our segment number two on what to do with moldy flower bulbs
0hw3suqbv7g_3_4-5-rgb_front there are a lot of things that can happen to your bulbs when they are stored i found bulbs under a table three years later it was a calla lily bulb and i planted it in the summertime and it came right up and bloomed beautifully
0hw3suqbv7g_5-5-rgb_front i have bought tulips put them in a plastic bag and threw them in the back of the trunk for a couple of weeks and they came out this moldy mushy mess
0hw3suqbv7g_6-5-rgb_front so there are some problems that you can have with bulbs but there are easy solutions
0hw3suqbv7g_7-5-rgb_front and i always treat gardening like throwing a party
0hw3suqbv7g_8-5-rgb_front you invite all the plants over some of them show up looking beautiful and good moods and having a good time others show up just a mess
0hw3suqbv7g_9-5-rgb_front so you enjoy their company while they are here and not take it personally and there are always more bulbs that you can purchase
0hfn3ts0fxq_0-5-rgb_front hi
0hfn3ts0fxq_10_11_12-5-rgb_front a paper towel works just nice what you want to do is you want to lay your squash in here we are not going to cook for too long because these should be thin enough so they cook fast
0hfn3ts0fxq_13-5-rgb_front after you have got your first layer go ahead and pour half your mixture over that
0hfn3ts0fxq_14-5-rgb_front what you want to do is go ahead and put the other half of the squash on there
0hfn3ts0fxq_15-5-rgb_front at this point we are going to go ahead and put the rest of the marinade on top
0hfn3ts0fxq_16-5-rgb_front make sure you get all of it on there
0hfn3ts0fxq_17-5-rgb_front move the seasoning around
0hfn3ts0fxq_18-5-rgb_front you are going to bake for about minutes
0hfn3ts0fxq_2-5-rgb_front now what we are going to do is we are going to actually bake our squash for a little bit
0hfn3ts0fxq_3-5-rgb_front you have your mixture and squash
0hfn3ts0fxq_4-5-rgb_front right over the cooking tray we are going to use this
0hfn3ts0fxq_5-5-rgb_front just pour a little bit on there
0hfn3ts0fxq_6-5-rgb_front evenly coat that
0hfn3ts0fxq_7-5-rgb_front if you have a brush you can
0hfn3ts0fxq_8-5-rgb_front if not you can throw in a piece of squash and move it around
0hfn3ts0fxq_9-5-rgb_front a quick little ways to get around stuff if you do not have it
0hjhatfgade_0-5-rgb_front hi
0hjhatfgade_10-5-rgb_front have been made out of coyote
0hjhatfgade_11-5-rgb_front got one here made out of coyote ruff
0hjhatfgade_12-5-rgb_front wolf is pretty prevalent wolverine is getting pricier very little trapping of wolverine in this state so we usually get it from northern canada
0hjhatfgade_13-5-rgb_front then i have a parka system where i would wear an anorak which is a pull over type of garment that zip all the way down
0hjhatfgade_14-5-rgb_front that keeps the wind from getting in the holes created naturally by the zipper
0hjhatfgade_2-5-rgb_front i would like to invite you to visit our website at www teamclarke org
0hjhatfgade_3-5-rgb_front a good parka is something to have and with that good parka you want to have a really good rough
0hjhatfgade_4-5-rgb_front they make ruffs out of different animal hides
0hjhatfgade_5-5-rgb_front the ruff is sort of that piece that goes around the top of the hood and a ruff will gather close to your face and keep the frost bite off your cheeks and nose
0hjhatfgade_6-5-rgb_front if it is made out of the correct animal hide coyote is used by sort of parkas
0hjhatfgade_7-5-rgb_front this is a really good parka and linda bought me this is a wolverine double ruff wolf on the outside and wolverine closest to your skin
0hjhatfgade_8-5-rgb_front the vest pieces of fur to keep frost off your face
0hjhatfgade_9-5-rgb_front neither wolf nor wolverine will absorb water or frost which is why they are used versus some of the other ruff materials
0hro1o6b2dg_1-5-rgb_front i am going to be using my assistant to help me out
0hro1o6b2dg_2-5-rgb_front now i am going to be cutting out the garlic
0hro1o6b2dg_3-5-rgb_front you can use garlic that is already prepared in a jar from the store but i prefer to use the garlic the fresh garlic it has more punching flavor
0hro1o6b2dg_4-5-rgb_front so to separate the garlic i am going to just but my knife down on top and give it a hit and that makes all of your garlic cloves come apart and i have decided that i am going to smash my garlic
0hro1o6b2dg_5-5-rgb_front you can also cut it to little fine dices so i am going to take one garlic clove which we need for this receipt and i am going to smash it again
0hro1o6b2dg_6-5-rgb_front and this makes the skin come right off and you can smash it again or you can dice it into little fine slices or you can smash it some more and make it into a paste
0hro1o6b2dg_7-5-rgb_front so that is your one garlic clove
0hxdpq1l4tk_1-5-rgb_front now that we have thoroughly cleaned off the oil drain plug we are going to clean off the oil pan a little bit where the plug goes into
0hxdpq1l4tk_2-5-rgb_front it is just about finished dripping so we are going to carefully put the plug back in
0hxdpq1l4tk_3-5-rgb_front many times you want to turn it to the left and feel the threads start to click in and then just simply screw that plug in till it is hand tight and then you would take your box end wrench
0hxdpq1l4tk_4-5-rgb_front put it on and then tighten it to the right and apply approximately pounds of tork to it
0hxdpq1l4tk_5-5-rgb_front it is pretty tight you do not want that to fall out
0hxdpq1l4tk_6-5-rgb_front so i am going to check it again
0hxdpq1l4tk_7-5-rgb_front now that is pretty tight
0hxdpq1l4tk_8-5-rgb_front okay and then clean it up a little bit and then you are ready to get out from under the vehicle
0i8juk3kc2w_0-5-rgb_front hi i am jessica meiczinger with simply divine events and i have been planning weddings for over a decade now and today i am going to talk about how to design ideas for a garden themed wedding reception
0i8juk3kc2w_1-5-rgb_front traditionally you can stick with your tiered wedding cake and just accent it with fresh flowers or you can do a fondant frosting on your cake and you can actually have hand made flowers of sugar
0i8juk3kc2w_2_3-5-rgb_front if you go to your specialty baker they can help you out with that another idea is to instead of doing a floral centerpiece on your table you can actually do miniature wedding cakes in the center of each table so that way your guests just serve themselves at the end of the dinner or you can do miniature cakes at each place setting
0i8juk3kc2w_4-5-rgb_front another fun idea that i like to do instead of doing a traditional wedding cake is having a desert table
0i8juk3kc2w_5-5-rgb_front you can do little pedifours with your monograms or little edible flowers attached to them
0i8juk3kc2w_6-5-rgb_front if you do not want to do cake you can do different cookies and pastries pies and tarts if you want to look for something different
0i8juk3kc2w_7-5-rgb_front another fun thing is to do actually cupcakes instead of a wedding cake
0i8juk3kc2w_8-5-rgb_front you can do different frostings you can do different flavors and just have them on different plate stands or cake stands and the guests can just serve themselves
0i8juk3kc2w_9-5-rgb_front so those are just some ideas on how to come up with some different wedding cakes for your garden wedding reception
0i9ks-bpfds_0-5-rgb_front we are in the process of hooking up the p trap for under the sink and i just want to remind you that the p trap acts as a gas break
0i9ks-bpfds_1-5-rgb_front the water from the sink will always stay in at about this level and that keeps the gases coming back from the sewer to come up through the sink drain
0i9ks-bpfds_10-5-rgb_front our supply lines are hooked up
0i9ks-bpfds_11-5-rgb_front our sink top has been glued to the top of the vanity
0i9ks-bpfds_12-5-rgb_front we have our faucet in place
0i9ks-bpfds_13-5-rgb_front we are ready for business
0i9ks-bpfds_14-5-rgb_front oh i now have the scutchens this is called a scutchen
0i9ks-bpfds_15-5-rgb_front i think it is french
0i9ks-bpfds_16-5-rgb_front anyways what it is designed to do is to go around the hole in the drywall so that bugs and air and other things do not come through and it kind of leaves it nice and pretty
0i9ks-bpfds_17-5-rgb_front now what we do is where i have a mounted then we can just take a screw and put through each hole and that holds it in place
0i9ks-bpfds_18-5-rgb_front the only thing we have left to do here is to put our floor board in
0i9ks-bpfds_2-5-rgb_front and as long as there is water in here that is where the gas is stopped is right there
0i9ks-bpfds_3-5-rgb_front so we are going to fit it into the trap adapter and we had to purchase an extra extension here because right here is the top of my p trap and here is the bottom of the drain coming out of the sink
0i9ks-bpfds_4-5-rgb_front so we bought this extension piece to make up the difference here
0i9ks-bpfds_5-5-rgb_front so let me see if i can get it in position here
0i9ks-bpfds_6-5-rgb_front nut goes on first and then we have a plastic compression ring which as the nut comes down it will compress against this pipe here and around this flange right here and that will keep it from leaking
0i9ks-bpfds_7-5-rgb_front so put the nut on
0i9ks-bpfds_8-5-rgb_front most of these fittings can just be hand tightened
0i9ks-bpfds_9-5-rgb_front ok now our drain is hooked up
0iczi26jdaq_0-5-rgb_front some of the tools we use as a police officer the main one is the computer
0iczi26jdaq_1-5-rgb_front we write reports all the time on pretty much everything we do
0iczi26jdaq_10-5-rgb_front some of the other tools that we use each day is we have we carry with us we do not use them each day
0iczi26jdaq_11-5-rgb_front we have our pistols we use and we have our tasers and with that you have to be certified with our pistol you have to be certified each year
0iczi26jdaq_12-5-rgb_front make sure we can pass the qualification
0iczi26jdaq_13-5-rgb_front if we can not then there is some problems and they need to work on that are we can not be a police officers
0iczi26jdaq_14-5-rgb_front and so with the tasers you need to know that is a great tool
0iczi26jdaq_15-5-rgb_front it prevents officers from getting hurt as well as the suspect that is fighting with this from getting hurt
0iczi26jdaq_16-5-rgb_front we are able to use the taser and they do not get hurt and we do not get hurt and things work out a lot better that way
0iczi26jdaq_17-5-rgb_front and so those you need to be certified in how to use them the proper way to use them for liability
0iczi26jdaq_18-5-rgb_front and so as a police officer there is many tools and then with that you need to be certified and keep up your certification each year to prevent any lawsuits or anything like that that may occur
0iczi26jdaq_19-5-rgb_front as far as vehicles tools we use we have chargers
0iczi26jdaq_2-5-rgb_front we have to put in a little note whether it is i unlocked the door to a car whatever it might be
0iczi26jdaq_20-5-rgb_front the pleasant grove police department and we have some explorers
0iczi26jdaq_21-5-rgb_front those are great tools we have also need to be certified with them
0iczi26jdaq_22-5-rgb_front go to the driving range and make sure that you are up to par we know our cars and if situations happen that we can handle our cars safely
0iczi26jdaq_23-5-rgb_front as far as there is different areas as a patrolman you can be involved in the motorcycles
0iczi26jdaq_24-5-rgb_front if a person has an interest and your department has motorcycles if you are interested in that each department is different
0iczi26jdaq_25-5-rgb_front you can get on a motorcycle once you go through the training and be in the traffic enforcement as far as writing tickets and patrolling the high density areas to try to slow cars down
0iczi26jdaq_26-5-rgb_front and some of the officers love it
0iczi26jdaq_27-5-rgb_front and i am not a big fan of it i probably crash but anyway it is all up to the person
0iczi26jdaq_28-5-rgb_front the officer there but anyway it is the officers have a good time with the motors
0iczi26jdaq_3-5-rgb_front the computer is probably the number one thing we use all the time
0iczi26jdaq_4-5-rgb_front and so it is good to be proficient with the computer know how to type
0iczi26jdaq_5-5-rgb_front and each department may have a program they used to write their reports on
0iczi26jdaq_6-5-rgb_front that is just a matter of getting with the department and learning what program it is and how it works but the computer is the number one thing we use
0iczi26jdaq_7-5-rgb_front and now with that computer you can look up lots of different things you can get on the websites look at as far as the county booking sheets and things like that to find out where people live or some of our suspects are and the computer is a great tool that you can use not even being out in the car you can track someone down through the computer programs
0iczi26jdaq_8-5-rgb_front as law enforcement has we can search different things that the average person will not be able to search because of our access we have
0iczi26jdaq_9-5-rgb_front and so the computer is a great tool as far as trying to track down suspects or people of interest
0iezaxxcjo4_0_1_3-5-rgb_front hi i am dr eric sayer from sayer family chiropractic in this segment we are going to be talking about some of the herbal or nutritional types of things that can be used to treat low back strains

0j3kagixlro_11-5-rgb_front it is very hard to actually hit a target but it will take a lot of practice and a lot of timing

0j3kagixlro_2-5-rgb_front there is types of there is a cheat and a regular okay

0j3kagixlro_4-5-rgb_front so one jump rotation then to a kick and then go all the way around into a punch
0j3kagixlro_5-5-rgb_front and then a regular is you jump two rotations in the air and you are going to through a hook kick out of it or a crescent kick okay
0j3kagixlro_6-5-rgb_front so a regular is off both legs and a cheat is off one leg
0j3kagixlro_7-5-rgb_front all right
0j3kagixlro_8-5-rgb_front so now a was invented by a martial artist for a competition and is a really showy kick but it can be also be very powerful
0j3kagixlro_9-5-rgb_front you can also hit a target or hit an opponent with it and it can be a knockout kick or a very forceful kick
0jh35eyysww_0-5-rgb_front alright drink we are about to make is called ponderosa
0jh35eyysww_1-5-rgb_front not only is a nice classy restaurant with a fantastic salad bar it is also a very good shot
0jh35eyysww_10-5-rgb_front bottoms up
0jh35eyysww_2-5-rgb_front i am going to server it up chilled go ahead and put some ice in a glass
0jh35eyysww_3-5-rgb_front and we will measure out two ounces of grain alcohol preferably a hundred and ninety proof
0jh35eyysww_4-5-rgb_front there is one and two
0jh35eyysww_5-5-rgb_front and we will follow that up with two ounces of orange soda
0jh35eyysww_6-5-rgb_front and orange soda will do since you are mixing it up with some super strong liquor does not really matter on the quality there
0jh35eyysww_7-5-rgb_front alright go ahead and just mix that back and forth a couple times you do not want to do not want to shake it up because of the carbonation in the soda
0jh35eyysww_8-5-rgb_front let is go ahead and grab a couple over sized shot glasses here and get our strainer and we will pour it in
0jh35eyysww_9-5-rgb_front got a nice orange shot with a lot of alcohol that you are really not going to taste a whole lot
0jla3fdxedm_0-5-rgb_front correcting the daily journal
0jla3fdxedm_1-5-rgb_front now in the beginning when children start writing on their own of course you want to encourage creativity and some people feel that correcting every little thing they do wrong is going to snub their creativity and make them frustrated
0jla3fdxedm_10-5-rgb_front and that more reinforces in their mind the correct way to write things
0jla3fdxedm_2-5-rgb_front i do not think that is necessarily true but i think in the beginning it is fun to let them write however they right and to save the journals and they can look back on it even a year later and laugh and say look at how i used to write it is so neat and you can save it it is so nostalgic
0jla3fdxedm_3-5-rgb_front but at some point you want to start correcting them and as soon as they ask you you want to give them a correction so in this case the child wrote wun the way it should be written phonetically but that is not the correct way so if they ask you how do i write it
0jla3fdxedm_4-5-rgb_front you can say you can tell them and when you are ready to start correcting their journals like i said you do not have to do it in the first few but after a while you can start correcting them
0jla3fdxedm_5-5-rgb_front what you do is you underwrite underneath and you would write the correct way in a different color one time and you know praise them on all the words that they wrote correctly and then show them talk about why that is spelled a little differently than they thought
0jla3fdxedm_6-5-rgb_front to the one time i went to the store and remember silent e you know tell them about each thing and i got a jug of milk
0jla3fdxedm_7-5-rgb_front almost perfect
0jla3fdxedm_8-5-rgb_front and that is how you can correct
0jla3fdxedm_9-5-rgb_front now sometimes you can even have them write the whole thing over again but that kind of ruins the fun in this case because it is a journal but other times when you have them practice writing and then you correct their writing it is not a bad idea to have them say now write this whole thing over with the corrections put in
0jzyw74996e_1-5-rgb_front in the following clips we are going to talk about the proper way to repack grease and adjust your vehicle is wheel barriers
0jzyw74996e_10-5-rgb_front you are going to do it in what they call a star pattern
0jzyw74996e_11-5-rgb_front we are going to go from here to the farthest one away
0jzyw74996e_12-5-rgb_front give her a little snug to the farthest one away
0jzyw74996e_13-5-rgb_front we only have one choice now
0jzyw74996e_14-5-rgb_front here to the farthest one away
0jzyw74996e_15-5-rgb_front here and to the farthest one away here
0jzyw74996e_16-5-rgb_front what that will do is ensure that the wheel is torched down flat and centered
0jzyw74996e_17-5-rgb_front that will eliminate any possible causes of vibration
0jzyw74996e_18-5-rgb_front what i am going to do now since i have my wheel snug is take and remove my jack stand get that guy out of the way and release the pressure on my hydraulic floor jack
0jzyw74996e_19-5-rgb_front you are going to want to let your jack creep down very slowly
0jzyw74996e_2-5-rgb_front in this clip what i am going to talk about is letting the vehicle down off of our jack and jack stands
0jzyw74996e_20-5-rgb_front it only takes about a of a turn on the release screw to open up the hydraulic circuit and allow the jack to collapse
0jzyw74996e_21-5-rgb_front once the pressure is released from the jack you can take and roll it out of the way
0jzyw74996e_22-5-rgb_front and that is the proper way to seat your wheel and let the vehicle down
0jzyw74996e_3-5-rgb_front before you do that you want to make sure lug nuts are run down pretty much just a fuzz past hand tight
0jzyw74996e_4-5-rgb_front it is going to be impossible to tark them being that the wheel free spins
0jzyw74996e_5-5-rgb_front so what you are going to do is just take and hold on to it and give them a twist
0jzyw74996e_6-5-rgb_front i am going to start here on a five bolt pattern which is percent of the vehicle is out there
0jzyw74996e_7-5-rgb_front you are going to go from here
0jzyw74996e_8-5-rgb_front you have two choices
0jzyw74996e_9-5-rgb_front this one or this one
0jtcvyxue30_1-5-rgb_front it is always important for a running back to continue with positive gains to be the person that initiates the contact
0jtcvyxue30_10-5-rgb_front never be the guy that gets hit
0jtcvyxue30_11-5-rgb_front we always want positive yardage after the carry
0jtcvyxue30_2-5-rgb_front he should never be the one that takes a hit
0jtcvyxue30_3-5-rgb_front we never want to see our running back coming out of the backfield taking a hand off and cower up when the defender comes up to hit him and drive him backwards
0jtcvyxue30_4-5-rgb_front if that happens he is probably not going to play running back very much longer
0jtcvyxue30_5-5-rgb_front what we always want to see him do is initiate contact in order to get as much positive yardage as they can
0jtcvyxue30_6-5-rgb_front they are going to get hit anyway so they might as well be the hitter not the hit tee
0jtcvyxue30_7-5-rgb_front you never want to be the person taking the contact you want to be the one dishing out the punishment
0jtcvyxue30_8-5-rgb_front what we want to see is once he takes the hand off we want to see him with that good low body lean and we want to see him put the contact on and drive through the hole in order to pick up a positive gain
0jtcvyxue30_9-5-rgb_front so always remember initiate the contact
0ksak51yxua_0-5-rgb_front today we are going to start printing in the dark room
0ksak51yxua_1-5-rgb_front one of the first things that you need to know how to do when you begin printing in your dark room is how to make your paper developer
0ksak51yxua_10-5-rgb_front it says right here what the temperature is you need to get
0ksak51yxua_11-5-rgb_front it is very important it is to degrees fahrenheit
0ksak51yxua_12-5-rgb_front it is very important that you get that water up to that temperature before you begin mixing it
0ksak51yxua_2-5-rgb_front you hear i stress paper because there is a difference between paper developer and film developer and i know the first few times when i was in the dark room i did not understand that
0ksak51yxua_3-5-rgb_front it was not a really good experience doing it that way
0ksak51yxua_4-5-rgb_front this is kodak dectal paper developer
0ksak51yxua_5-5-rgb_front i kind of like the way kodak does it because it says right on the packaging paper
0ksak51yxua_6-5-rgb_front so this way when you have film developer like i showed you on the last episode it says film
0ksak51yxua_7-5-rgb_front one important aspect about making this is that you have to understand it is a powder
0ksak51yxua_8-5-rgb_front there are some film developers that are liquid
0ksak51yxua_9-5-rgb_front when you begin making this again it is a lot like making this it is a lot like making a cake again
0ku13ah-7bq_0-5-rgb_front so the first thing we are going to do is apply some foundation primer
0ku13ah-7bq_1-5-rgb_front this is a silicone based product
0ku13ah-7bq_10-5-rgb_front so that is how you would want to apply a primer prior to your foundation
0ku13ah-7bq_2-5-rgb_front silicone is a breathable barrier for the skin so it is going to allow oxygen in and out of the follicles so it will not clog the pores and it also will prevent breakouts
0ku13ah-7bq_3-5-rgb_front it is oil free it will give you some oil absorption throughout the day
0ku13ah-7bq_4-5-rgb_front so we are just going to take a little bit right on our fingertips do some fingertip application
0ku13ah-7bq_5-5-rgb_front just gently apply it all over the surface of the skin
0ku13ah-7bq_6-5-rgb_front basically what this is doing is it is smoothing the surface of the skin it is helping to minimize the appearance of any pores
0ku13ah-7bq_7-5-rgb_front it also softens any fine lines or wrinkles so your makeup will not settle into any crevices
0ku13ah-7bq_8-5-rgb_front it also prevents your makeup from absorbing into the skin so it is going to keep your makeup looking a lot fresher throughout the day
0ku13ah-7bq_9-5-rgb_front it is going to keep it on a lot longer for you keep it looking a lot better it will soak up any oily shine and just basically is going to keep your makeup looking really great all day long
0klw2oycfoe_0-5-rgb_front alexson roy so what we are going to talk about now is maybe chronic issues that a lot of athletes deal with
0klw2oycfoe_1-5-rgb_front and once again it all has to do with the joint issues okay
0klw2oycfoe_10-5-rgb_front you are going to have a lot of lower back issues okay and that has to do with your hips and kinda like putting a lot of load on your core
0klw2oycfoe_11-5-rgb_front and then the other issue is with a lot of golfers and tennis players they have problems with their elbows
0klw2oycfoe_12-5-rgb_front and there is actually a condition called tennis elbow that when you do your back swing it has to do with all the muscles that contribute to your back swing and then with golfers you are swinging forward
0klw2oycfoe_13-5-rgb_front so within the elbow there is a point there which is called your epicondyle and this is medial which is inside is affected with that
0klw2oycfoe_14-5-rgb_front and then you have your runners okay
0klw2oycfoe_15-5-rgb_front hamstrings is definitely a problem
0klw2oycfoe_16-5-rgb_front everything down here like below your glute inside your thighs
0klw2oycfoe_17-5-rgb_front and then with soccer players it is your shins okay the part on the other side of your calf cause you are being kicked all the time in your shin
0klw2oycfoe_18-5-rgb_front and with running constantly in soccer that area gets really tense
0klw2oycfoe_19-5-rgb_front and so what we are going to do today is we are going to focus on just some of these issues that i talked about as far as conditions that have to do with injuries okay
0klw2oycfoe_2-5-rgb_front so there is a number of issues that a lot of athletes deal with
0klw2oycfoe_20-5-rgb_front so we are going to focus on four main issues today
0klw2oycfoe_3-5-rgb_front one of em okay that a lot of football players have to deal with is issues to their spine which begins in the neck because there is a lot of contact there is a lot of blows that they take to the neck
0klw2oycfoe_4-5-rgb_front they kinda concave like all of these vertebras from the base of the neck to the shoulder
0klw2oycfoe_5-5-rgb_front so from that they have a lot of shoulder issues
0klw2oycfoe_6-5-rgb_front okay
0klw2oycfoe_7-5-rgb_front and then you is say your baseball players
0klw2oycfoe_8-5-rgb_front if you are a pitcher most likely you are going to throw your rotator cuff out and most of you know your upper back is going to be affected by that
0klw2oycfoe_9-5-rgb_front and if you are a power lifter okay
0kpjxzhytuo_0-5-rgb_front hello
0kpjxzhytuo_1-5-rgb_front my name is gabriela garzon at g g
0kpjxzhytuo_10-5-rgb_front image and etiquette consulting
0kpjxzhytuo_2-5-rgb_front image and etiquette consulting in miami florida
0kpjxzhytuo_3-5-rgb_front in this clip i am going to talk about how to build a spring wardrobe for women
0kpjxzhytuo_4-5-rgb_front basically you are doing a transition here so here you can start using like whites and light pastels
0kpjxzhytuo_5-5-rgb_front basically try to have like light dresses
0kpjxzhytuo_6-5-rgb_front this is like a very nice flowy white dress that you can transition into the summer or you can start using like khaki is with like pastel colors like the pink type of sweaters that you can just go ahead and layer on top of like pant tops or crew neck type of tops and other type of sweaters with different neck lines
0kpjxzhytuo_7-5-rgb_front you can start using really fun jackets because it is still you know it is still a little cool and you can just always want to try and cover yourself with cool things and bright colors and happy colors
0kpjxzhytuo_8-5-rgb_front and if it get if it starts getting chilly you can use like you know like very light type of pastel color trench coats and of course you should have boots so you can wear the dresses with the boots closed toe heels and just fun accessories
0kpjxzhytuo_9-5-rgb_front once again this is gabbie at g g
0mqwtxqn-x8_0-5-rgb_front okay when you are playing golf we have covered this just a little bit but your goal on every hole should be to get a par because that means if it is a par four you are going to get two strokes to get around the green and then you are either going to make your chip close and make the putt or you are going to be on the green in two and two puts so that will be your par
0mqwtxqn-x8_1-5-rgb_front so if you hit a great second shot that might leave you a short putt to make your birdie but you always have to count on trying to get a par on every hole and that would mean that you are a pretty proficient golfer
0mqwtxqn-x8_2-5-rgb_front a bogey just means somewhere along the line you have lost a shot whether you three putted put a ball out of bounds put a ball in thick rough and had to recover from it behind a tree
0mqwtxqn-x8_3-5-rgb_front there is so many things that can go wrong that sometimes saving a bogey is a good thing
0mqwtxqn-x8_4-5-rgb_front then a birdie is when everything goes right for the most part and you hit a couple great shots and you get close to the hole and make the putt
0mqwtxqn-x8_5-5-rgb_front so there is par fives there is par fours and there is par three is
0mqwtxqn-x8_6-5-rgb_front par three is are usually going to be under two hundred and eighty yards anything above that will be a par four and anything over four hundred and sixty yards will be a par five
0mqwtxqn-x8_7-5-rgb_front now those are the distances the pros play at but for the recreational player the distances might be not quite as long but that is generally what it is
0mqwtxqn-x8_8-5-rgb_front if you really are interested in this topic there is some good books or other reference material you can scour and really learn what all this stuff means
0mqwtxqn-x8_9-5-rgb_front that is just a good brief overview of what par birdie and bogey mean
0mybh0x1yqw_1-5-rgb_front colors for victorian house that we had seen were all white so i got on the internet to see if that is what we wanted to do
0mybh0x1yqw_2-5-rgb_front the victorian houses we are built from probably to so our house we think they built it in the victorians loved bright colors they did not like white but in the early is when the banks went belly up that is all they could get was white paint
0mybh0x1yqw_3-5-rgb_front the colors were so expensive that they quit making colored paint the victorians loved greens dark reds mustard yellow grays anything that had a nature color to it they loved
0mybh0x1yqw_4-5-rgb_front so therefore we painted our trim the red and green and the sage color or the light green those we are the colors that we loved
0ohn9y80nme_0-5-rgb_front i am here talking to you today about liners
0ohn9y80nme_1-5-rgb_front what they are
0ohn9y80nme_2-5-rgb_front what they are is a accent piece for your frame to ensure that you have a little classier look about it
0ohn9y80nme_3-5-rgb_front they come in different sizes different shapes different ways of looking at things some go in some go out some just sit there
0ohn9y80nme_4-5-rgb_front some have a little gold accent with them some of them you have to go back to the fillet thought and put it in as well
0ohn9y80nme_5-5-rgb_front in my opinion your lighter should be as big as your frame
0ohn9y80nme_6-5-rgb_front if i was going to use this liner i probably go to a different frame
0ohn9y80nme_7-5-rgb_front a little bit bigger frame the portion is quite nice then you can use a little bitty liner in this
0ohn9y80nme_8-5-rgb_front the old school thought was if you had a piece of canvas you had to have a liner
0ohn9y80nme_9-5-rgb_front that is not the case today things have changed drastically it was just an old wise tail that was said down the way
0ob9wkq1ayk_0-5-rgb_front so we have ridden the roller coaster up one hill down a trough up another hill and now for round four we are going back in to the valley
0ob9wkq1ayk_1-5-rgb_front and what that means is we have to make our best four card low hand
0ob9wkq1ayk_10-5-rgb_front not even sure why he stayed in the hand except for the sake of our experiment
0ob9wkq1ayk_11-5-rgb_front you win the pot of sixteen and he matches the pot of sixteen and we are on to round five
0ob9wkq1ayk_2-5-rgb_front now we already know from a previous round that i have any low action going on so not going to play this hand
0ob9wkq1ayk_3-5-rgb_front okay and we know from a previous round that this guy does not have any low action going on
0ob9wkq1ayk_4-5-rgb_front he is not going to play this hand
0ob9wkq1ayk_5-5-rgb_front but you and this fellow say one two three and show your chip and show each other your hands
0ob9wkq1ayk_6-5-rgb_front and this is your hand you have got what is called a queen low
0ob9wkq1ayk_7-5-rgb_front you have got
0ob9wkq1ayk_8-5-rgb_front at this point if this guy does not have and ace but has something lower than a queen and nothing higher than a queen he is got you
0ob9wkq1ayk_9-5-rgb_front alas he got a pair of sevens there so no working four card low and you take the pot and he pays
0og2_ujywyg_0-5-rgb_front alright so how do we use this that again can be the biggest thing of i brought something but i do not even know how to use it

0og2_ujywyg_18-5-rgb_front and now it tells me that i am at twenty one point two percent and my bmi is at twenty two point eight percent
0og2_ujywyg_19-5-rgb_front so those numbers are pretty different from the other body fat monitor i showed you but it let is you know where it can be a little more accurate or a little less accurate
0og2_ujywyg_2-5-rgb_front omcron fat loss monitor is basic
0og2_ujywyg_20-5-rgb_front and that is it got that vital information

0ox8b-twkes_0-5-rgb_front in this clip we will talk about how to obtain information about phobias for you or a loved one
0ox8b-twkes_1-5-rgb_front one of the things that you want to do is if you have access to the internet hop on the net it is the fastest way to get the information you might be looking for
0ox8b-twkes_10-5-rgb_front maybe instead of taking it yourself you can hand it to the person that is having the phobia or the problem
0ox8b-twkes_11-5-rgb_front if you do not have access to the internet you can go to your public library you can look at magazines again you can talk to doctors because they will also have this information that is available
0ox8b-twkes_2-5-rgb_front now if you type in phobia you are going to get a lot of hits so you want to try to narrow it down
0ox8b-twkes_3-5-rgb_front type in the name of a specific phobia in a search engine such as google or ask com or yahoo com and you will get a lot more information
0ox8b-twkes_4-5-rgb_front if you want to go to a source that is a little bit more specific and health based you can go to something like webmd com or mayo that is com or you can also go to the national institute of mental health web site where they have not only what different phobias are but kind of some of the treatments
0ox8b-twkes_5-5-rgb_front and some of these websites even have questionnaires
0ox8b-twkes_6-5-rgb_front if you think you have a phobia or you may have a phobia if and you can kind of check it off
0ox8b-twkes_7-5-rgb_front and then the great thing is you can print this out take it to your physician and say hey i took this test and this what it came out what do you think so it can actually be a very good tool
0ox8b-twkes_8-5-rgb_front if you are a family member same thing applies

0pcwadlp-9q_0-8-rgb_front clancy rose so next we are going to go on to steaming your milk for your single vanilla latte
0pcwadlp-9q_1-8-rgb_front i have got my milk steaming pitcher and my milk doing this in a cup so i am going to pour the milk into the pitcher right up to the ridge of the pitcher
0pcwadlp-9q_2-8-rgb_front when it is flat it is up to the ridge
0pcwadlp-9q_3-8-rgb_front i will show you how much milk is in there and i am going to go ahead and steam the milk
0pcwadlp-9q_4-8-rgb_front what i do is i do this in three steps
0pcwadlp-9q_5-8-rgb_front first position the pitcher so that the milk steaming wand is under the surface of the milk and you get it at an angle so that once you turn on the wand the milk starts spinning around in a circle around the pitcher
0pcwadlp-9q_6-8-rgb_front second step is after you keep it spinning until it kind of matches the temperature of your hand you are going to feel it just break just warm up then you are going to drop it down to where the tip of the milk steaming wand is just above the surface of the milk
0pcwadlp-9q_7-8-rgb_front it is going to start introducing air into the milk and that is where you are creating the foam and you are going to be able to hear that change
0pcwadlp-9q_8-8-rgb_front we are going to do that for a few seconds maybe about five seconds and then you drop it back down to where this the wand is submerged into the pitcher of milk and then get it spinning around inside the pitcher again until it is at the temperature that you want it
0pmxyto5cku_0-5-rgb_front hi this is rich buccola here in nyc
0pmxyto5cku_10-5-rgb_front what is great about these cutting boards is just pick it up put it right into our bowl
0pmxyto5cku_11-5-rgb_front but also at this point i am going to add a little bit more salt going around a couple of times and some more fresh pepper we are going to mix all this thoroughly through
0pmxyto5cku_12-5-rgb_front it is coming together
0pmxyto5cku_13-5-rgb_front we are going to start now with our phyllo bread and we are going to add a little parsley to this too
0pmxyto5cku_2-5-rgb_front i like to let my chicken settle because what happens is if you cut it right away all the juice will fall out
0pmxyto5cku_3-5-rgb_front if you let it sit the juices tend to stay in
0pmxyto5cku_4-5-rgb_front this is also a good time to preheat your oven to degrees
0pmxyto5cku_5-5-rgb_front i just laid my chicken out like this and i will just cut it in like quarter inch pieces like so and we are just going to get nice bite size cubes
0pmxyto5cku_6-5-rgb_front so we are just going to cut it like across and then you turn your chicken this way again just quarter inch just make little bite size pieces
0pmxyto5cku_7-5-rgb_front i am just putting some chicken on top of chicken just to make it a little easier cutting three pieces at a time
0pmxyto5cku_8-5-rgb_front what you are going to do is just cut it one way turn it like so and cut these into bite size pieces
0pmxyto5cku_9-5-rgb_front so we have all our pieces in bite size
0prm2uwuflq_1-5-rgb_front the profile over the wood shake panel is comprised of a inch low inch high inch low and a inch high pattern
0prm2uwuflq_2-5-rgb_front each full panel has a two pattern repeat
0prm2uwuflq_3-5-rgb_front this allows for two off setting points per panel
0prm2uwuflq_4-5-rgb_front the rear shelf of the shake panel is profiled to match the pattern at the front of the panel which is offset by inches to the left
0prm2uwuflq_5-5-rgb_front in basic terms it provides for the profile to advance inches to the right and or inches to the left for a net offset of inches of every second course
0prm2uwuflq_6-5-rgb_front as the panel has two panel repeats this further allows for a inch offset to the right and a inch offset to the left
0prm2uwuflq_7-5-rgb_front as the pattern slowly advances to the left it is at your convenience where you start your first panel
0prm2uwuflq_8-5-rgb_front for hip valley installation you should adjust this to eliminate cuts and bends diagonally across the in joints of a panel
0prm2uwuflq_9-5-rgb_front again fasten the first course through the back shelf and lay two courses of tile at one time to assure accurate panel fitments
0plx1nykywe_0-5-rgb_front parrots talk actually trying to mimic you to get your attention
0plx1nykywe_1-5-rgb_front if they hear you saying certain things and people pay attention to you then they decide well maybe if i say something then i will get your attention too
0plx1nykywe_10-5-rgb_front but i usually go to my birds when i want to teach them to talk about the same time every morning and say the same phrase
0plx1nykywe_11-5-rgb_front i can say other phrases throughout the day
0plx1nykywe_12-5-rgb_front but then at the evening time i go back and use that same phrase again
0plx1nykywe_13-5-rgb_front this bird right here is learning to say pretty bird or pretty pretty pretty bird because the more pretties he adds to it he feels like he gets my attention a little faster
0plx1nykywe_14-5-rgb_front but he is very intelligent
0plx1nykywe_15-5-rgb_front this bird is about six months old and like i said this morning he said for the first time love you
0plx1nykywe_16-5-rgb_front and that was the first time he is ever said that to me
0plx1nykywe_17-5-rgb_front but he does listen
0plx1nykywe_18-5-rgb_front as you can see he is watching very closely what i am saying and that i am talking
0plx1nykywe_19-5-rgb_front of course he thinks i am talking just to him
0plx1nykywe_2-5-rgb_front and they are very much like two year olds
0plx1nykywe_20-5-rgb_front but they are very affectionate and they will talk to get your attention
0plx1nykywe_21-5-rgb_front also they do not have lips so some of their letters are not pronounced exactly like we would but some of them do quite well with that
0plx1nykywe_22_23-5-rgb_front also you hear an adage that to make a bird talk you have to split their tongue this was believed back in what i am hoping was olden days when they would try to teach crows to talk
0plx1nykywe_24-5-rgb_front crows can talk without their tongues being split and without them being harmed in any way
0plx1nykywe_25-5-rgb_front and of course these babies never get their tongues split
0plx1nykywe_3-5-rgb_front like i said they want your attention at all times
0plx1nykywe_4-5-rgb_front they do understand
0plx1nykywe_5-5-rgb_front i have got this one and a couple more that when they leave their cage and so forth i can tell them no you have to go back home and they go right straight to their cage
0plx1nykywe_6_7_8-5-rgb_front they know exactly what is meant a lot of people think that parrots just mimic sounds but it is been proven here lately that no they understand and they know what they are saying
0plx1nykywe_9-5-rgb_front some parrots are slower to learn to talk and that could be from many things from their intelligence from their environment or whatever

0psmj0gsjjs_14-5-rgb_front teri what do you mean there might be
0psmj0gsjjs_15-5-rgb_front are they small
0psmj0gsjjs_16-5-rgb_front david they can be yea
0psmj0gsjjs_17-5-rgb_front teri can they also be large
0psmj0gsjjs_18-5-rgb_front david yes
0psmj0gsjjs_19-5-rgb_front teri what color would they be if there was one
0psmj0gsjjs_2-5-rgb_front you need a minimum of two people to play this game
0psmj0gsjjs_20-5-rgb_front david black gray and gross
0psmj0gsjjs_21-5-rgb_front teri oh ah
0psmj0gsjjs_22-5-rgb_front is it when people do not clean their house too well
0psmj0gsjjs_23-5-rgb_front do you see a lot of these
0psmj0gsjjs_24-5-rgb_front david yes teri are you afraid of dust
0psmj0gsjjs_25-5-rgb_front david no teri dust bunnies

0psmj0gsjjs_28-5-rgb_front david yes
0psmj0gsjjs_29-5-rgb_front teri okay mud
0psmj0gsjjs_3-5-rgb_front how you play is you choose one person who is going to be the patient and anyone else who is there are going to play the psychiatrists
0psmj0gsjjs_30-5-rgb_front david no
0psmj0gsjjs_31-5-rgb_front teri okay well you say if david where did you get your psychiatrist degree
0psmj0gsjjs_32-5-rgb_front teri ah back in ohio state university

0psmj0gsjjs_4-5-rgb_front so you can have one or several psychiatrists in your game
0psmj0gsjjs_5-5-rgb_front the patient chooses something they are deathly afraid of a big phobia a big fear and we have to try and guess what their fear is
0psmj0gsjjs_6-5-rgb_front they can not tell us but we can ask questions and through process of elimination we have to figure out what their phobia is
0psmj0gsjjs_7-5-rgb_front when we guess it then we become the patient
0psmj0gsjjs_8-5-rgb_front teri are you ready
0psmj0gsjjs_9-5-rgb_front do you have one in your head
0pzzp3rhyeo_0-5-rgb_front this advanced pilates exercise is called the side kick bicycle and it is advanced because we are creating a lot of movement because we really have to draw in those abdominal muscles and keep everything stabilized
0pzzp3rhyeo_1-5-rgb_front now come on down to your side and you want your elbows directly underneath your shoulders so you are resting on your forearm lift up out of your rib cage abdominals in your hips are stacked one on top of the other and your bottom leg is turned out and anchored
0pzzp3rhyeo_2-5-rgb_front now we are going to make this a little bit more advanced because we do not want to put pressure or use this hand to stabilize we want to use all core so bring that top hand behind the head
0pzzp3rhyeo_3-5-rgb_front you are going to draw the knee in towards the chest kick out and circle back and with your breathing just breathe naturally keep your hips as stabilized as possible and then when you perform anywhere between to reps in this direction reverse and then really reach out through those toes reach reach reach lengthen lengthen lengthen
0pzzp3rhyeo_4-5-rgb_front that is the pilates theme and that is your side kick bicycle exercise
0q0tb41rahc_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is jill weiss and i am going to give you a few tips on how to throw a curve ball in slow pitch
0q0tb41rahc_1-5-rgb_front first thing that you want to remember is the pitch
0q0tb41rahc_10-5-rgb_front my name is jill weiss and those are just a few tips on how to throw a curve ball in slow pitch
0q0tb41rahc_2-5-rgb_front depending on the batter if they are left handed or right handed you always want the curve ball to kind of go away from the batter
0q0tb41rahc_3-5-rgb_front this kind of especially when you are ahead of the count this is something different that pitchers can throw to finish that out or get them to have an easy grounder a pop up or strike out
0q0tb41rahc_4-5-rgb_front so for instance if i have a left handed batter up i am going to find the seams of the ball
0q0tb41rahc_5-5-rgb_front i do not want to be too deep into my palm but comfortable and loose to where i can turn the ball
0q0tb41rahc_6-5-rgb_front one scenario i can use is turning the doorknob
0q0tb41rahc_7-5-rgb_front actually spinning my wrist to have that downward motion with the ball
0q0tb41rahc_8-5-rgb_front now the opposite if i was going to have a right handed batter i am going to slice it underneath okay to get that spin this way
0q0tb41rahc_9-5-rgb_front so on a left handed batter you are going to turn that knob and it is going to go away from the batter
0qvx3q_povg_1-5-rgb_front we are going to take some fresh garlic we need about cloves of garlic
0qvx3q_povg_10-5-rgb_front so this is what cloves or cloves of garlic looks like finely minced
0qvx3q_povg_11-5-rgb_front see how nice and tiny and beautiful
0qvx3q_povg_12-5-rgb_front we are just going to add this right to our bowl so do not be afraid just come right here look at that
0qvx3q_povg_13-5-rgb_front what we are going to do then is start mixing it all together
0qvx3q_povg_2-5-rgb_front i love garlic and everything heck i will put garlic in my cereal if i could
0qvx3q_povg_3-5-rgb_front when we come back we are going to take some garlic and chop it up
0qvx3q_povg_4-5-rgb_front so we have our fresh garlic if you just give it a good break you can see all the cloves come out we need about cloves
0qvx3q_povg_5-5-rgb_front we are going to take our clove of garlic just give it a good punch with our knife and you see it comes right out of the shell like so and what you might want to do is just cut off this tip
0qvx3q_povg_6-5-rgb_front so that is a hard tip from the stem and that is your garlic getting ready for chopping get another punch and you see it comes right out of the shell
0qvx3q_povg_7-5-rgb_front what you are going to do then now is just slice your garlic one way very thin slices
0qvx3q_povg_8-5-rgb_front do not cut yourself turn it the other way just like we did with our onion and just cut your garlic
0qvx3q_povg_9-5-rgb_front do not worry again if it is not a desired consistency of size because we will start to do is using our chopping method is work the back of the blade and chop this up real fine
0qyzadqk-z4_0_1-8-rgb_front the next thing i would like to discuss is putting the tattoo needle in the tattoo machine once it is removed out of its sterile package it is going to look like this there is a small rubber grommet that is inserted into the back of the needle and that is to keep it stationary on the machine
0qyzadqk-z4_10_11-8-rgb_front we are going to slide this up now you have to be extremely careful when you do this that the needle in the tip does not bang against the sides because it will dull it
0qyzadqk-z4_12-8-rgb_front these are razor sharp needles and any burrs or anything like that will affect your tattoo in performance
0qyzadqk-z4_13-8-rgb_front so as we bring it in we are going to pull all the way back until the needle slightly pokes out from the front of the needle just a little bit
0qyzadqk-z4_2-8-rgb_front one little tattoo secrets is when you pull the needle out of the package it is going to be straight
0qyzadqk-z4_3-8-rgb_front with the needle down you are going to want to slightly bend it so it is arced slightly and i will explain right now why that is
0qyzadqk-z4_4-8-rgb_front here is our tattoo machine
0qyzadqk-z4_5-8-rgb_front you are going to want to hold it from the top and the bottom and insert the needle through the front and you can hold it with your fingers like such and you apply it onto the bar that is here
0qyzadqk-z4_6-8-rgb_front now it is stationary
0qyzadqk-z4_7-8-rgb_front it can not really wiggle around
0qyzadqk-z4_8-8-rgb_front now you can see that it is arced down
0qyzadqk-z4_9-8-rgb_front the reason we do that is as we install the needle tube this is the reservoir in front of the needle that is going to hold the ink
0q_iyr8gv38_0-5-rgb_front so the first step in the eye treatment in the soothing eye treatment would be to remove any makeup that your client might be wearing
0q_iyr8gv38_1-5-rgb_front and today jen is wearing a little mascara and eye shadow so i am just going to gently using a makeup removing you know cleanser or eye makeup remover
0q_iyr8gv38_2-5-rgb_front you just want to go over the eye area and kind of wipe down very gently and then away from the inner eye
0q_iyr8gv38_3-5-rgb_front and it might take a few cotton pads
0q_iyr8gv38_4-5-rgb_front and the reason why i am going away from the eye area is that is just to avoid any infection or irritation
0q_iyr8gv38_5-5-rgb_front usually people is eyes are pretty sensitive especially with allergies and all the above so by moving away from the eye you are just avoiding potential hazard for the future
0q_iyr8gv38_6-5-rgb_front if someone is coming straight from work or you know just had to do errands and usually wears makeup that is just fine usually the makeup removing part of any treatment is you know complimentary and included in any facial or eye treatment so you do not need to tell your clients you know to come in without any makeup on
0q_iyr8gv38_7-5-rgb_front usually when people are complaining of tired or stressed looking eyes makeup is the first thing that they go for so whatever you know your clients are doing to help brighten or open or their eyes is probably fine and what makes them comfortable so definitely do not discourage your clients in doing their regular routine
0q_iyr8gv38_8-5-rgb_front but of course getting an eye treatment is would be beneficial in helping to reduce their concerns
0q_iyr8gv38_9-5-rgb_front and this is the makeup removing part of the eye treatment
0qa_d2lck4g_3-5-rgb_front to paint on canvas basically you have to prime the entire canvas with one color and that is called the grounding
0qa_d2lck4g_4-5-rgb_front grounding is very important because if you paint on white you have got a situation where you have got to really cover that canvas every inch of it with a color
0qa_d2lck4g_5-5-rgb_front many artists for example like peter paul rubens did a ground a color that was homogenous all over the canvas in stripes to create this effect of movement
0qa_d2lck4g_6-5-rgb_front so you can use a canvas
0qa_d2lck4g_7-5-rgb_front use your own ground whether it be gray yellow and then begin painting and enjoy
0qdmykkfziw_1-5-rgb_front so now we have sliced our mirliton in half again chayote in some parts of the country
0qdmykkfziw_10-5-rgb_front so what you want to do is just keep a eye on them
0qdmykkfziw_11-5-rgb_front about minutes range maybe put a knife or a fork in there just to see if it is tender and we would show you what you do after that
0qdmykkfziw_2-5-rgb_front we have our water coming to a boil right here and we want to season this with some salt
0qdmykkfziw_3-5-rgb_front so give just a few grinds
0qdmykkfziw_4-5-rgb_front the mirlitons will pick up a lot of salt flavor so do not go over board
0qdmykkfziw_5-5-rgb_front almost like what you would do with pasta go ahead and do it that way
0qdmykkfziw_6-5-rgb_front then we are going to leave this seed in because we are going to remove this later
0qdmykkfziw_7-5-rgb_front this is going to be our chauffeur in the beautiful stuffing that we would make
0qdmykkfziw_8-5-rgb_front so just go ahead and put that right into the boiling water
0qdmykkfziw_9-5-rgb_front this is going to go about minutes until they are fork tender
0rac9hk-ylk_0-5-rgb_front today i would like to talk about the theory of
0rac9hk-ylk_1-5-rgb_front whenever you are working with beads wires or whatever type of necklace bracelet or earrings
0rac9hk-ylk_10-5-rgb_front as you are deciding what beads are going to go with what you may want to think about the theory of
0rac9hk-ylk_2-5-rgb_front threes are really the best way to kind of correspond your jewelry
0rac9hk-ylk_3-5-rgb_front you will see right here is a necklace
0rac9hk-ylk_4-5-rgb_front we go beads
0rac9hk-ylk_5-5-rgb_front usually small on the side and one large in the middle
0rac9hk-ylk_6-5-rgb_front that is usually a very typical thing that you will see in hoops or even regular earrings
0rac9hk-ylk_7-5-rgb_front we have small and one large earring
0rac9hk-ylk_8-5-rgb_front for necklaces you will see this particular necklace starts off with a large pendant and then you have jade beads with connectors and you have diamond shapes as well
0rac9hk-ylk_9-5-rgb_front it really corresponds and makes the jewelry or the art behind the jewelry really connect and come together

0rxxoobskmk_4-5-rgb_front now i am using what is called a jigger to measure the alcohol for this shot
0rxxoobskmk_5-5-rgb_front these are really great you can get them at a bar supply store or a liquor store
0rxxoobskmk_6-5-rgb_front this side is an ounce this side is a half ounce perfect for parties use it at work great for mixing your drinks so you get your proportions correct

0rbuesoc434_0-5-rgb_front all right the drink we are about to make is called a bacardi cocktail
0rbuesoc434_1-5-rgb_front and first thing we are going to do is put some ice the glass
0rbuesoc434_2-5-rgb_front and we will do one shot of bacardi light rum
0rbuesoc434_3-5-rgb_front hence the bacardi cocktail
0rbuesoc434_4-5-rgb_front and follow that up with about an ounce of lime juice
0rbuesoc434_5-5-rgb_front so let is do a half of shot
0rbuesoc434_6-5-rgb_front there we go
0rbuesoc434_7-5-rgb_front and then we are going to do a teaspoon a half a teaspoon of sugar syrup
0rbuesoc434_8-5-rgb_front and all we did was combine water and sugar mix it together that is going to give you your sugar syrup
0rbuesoc434_9-5-rgb_front pretty difficult huh
0relp4ynpnk_0-5-rgb_front hi i am stan defreitas mr green thumb
0relp4ynpnk_1-5-rgb_front this happens to be the italian oregano
0relp4ynpnk_2-5-rgb_front and it is one that you might wish to consider using in your yard or garden
0relp4ynpnk_3-5-rgb_front now it is a finer leaf plant than some of your oreganos and it is one of course that tends to be a little more prostrate tends to be used in baskets or sometimes larger containers where it can kind of spill over the side of the container
0relp4ynpnk_4-5-rgb_front as far as drainage make sure it has extra pearlite vermiculite or sand because it does need a good deal of drainage
0relp4ynpnk_5-5-rgb_front that being said you do want to water it probably every second or third day if it is in a dry hot condition
0relp4ynpnk_6-5-rgb_front remember of course that it also needs near full sun for it to kind of leaf out and be as full as it can be
0rqurufgdjo_0-5-rgb_front this bathing suit i designed it and i immediately thought of old home videos of my grandmother on the beach in long island and she would have worn something like this so it kind of makes me smile but obviously it is not for everybody it is not very modern looking
0rqurufgdjo_1-5-rgb_front it is more of a harkening back to the is era design and we have a very high waist but i added in a keyhole right there to show some skin so it is not so covered up and then buttons which they do not button or anything but they are there for looks and the top i have in order to not make it look so modest and old i added a top that is strapless but it still retains a lot of coverage and it has buttons for the detail as well and this is the kind of thing that i do not personally like but you have to throw out whatever goes from the brain to your hand just draw it and you never know where it will take you
0rsdwk7shje_0-5-rgb_front hi
0rsdwk7shje_10-5-rgb_front it needs to dry completely before you put glitter on it if you want to

0rsdwk7shje_15-5-rgb_front let is pick it up
0rsdwk7shje_16-5-rgb_front do not touch it because your fingerprint will be on there
0rsdwk7shje_17-5-rgb_front we are going to set it somewhere
0rsdwk7shje_18-5-rgb_front if you want to dry it you can put a fan on it
0rsdwk7shje_19-5-rgb_front does not take long to dry
0rsdwk7shje_2-5-rgb_front we are making light switch plate covers
0rsdwk7shje_20-5-rgb_front it is just like elmer is glue
0rsdwk7shje_21-5-rgb_front let it sit somewhere and let it dry completely
0rsdwk7shje_22-5-rgb_front make sure it is the way you want it and it is shaped the way you want it

0rsdwk7shje_6-5-rgb_front they are all nice and in one direction
0rsdwk7shje_7-5-rgb_front it can dry like that
0rsdwk7shje_8-5-rgb_front i do not have any fingerprints on there
0rsdwk7shje_9-5-rgb_front it is going to dry like that
0s2jbzhswxw_1-8-rgb_front we would put little things all around that
0s2jbzhswxw_2-8-rgb_front as in christmas ornaments or some more smaller patterns or some more smaller items
0s2jbzhswxw_3-8-rgb_front now we try to utilize every step every piece every inch of our kiln because it is so expensive to fire this but we are look at hundred dollars for a load of propane gas
0s2jbzhswxw_4-8-rgb_front my husband and i our dream was to build a gas kiln and this is out kiln that we built ourselves it has burners and it has about of fire brick
0s2jbzhswxw_5-8-rgb_front you would expect it to be very heavy but it is not it is very very light but it is very self containing of the flame and they weight about pounds each and they are very difficult for me to get on the very top so my husband usually loads the kiln
0s2jbzhswxw_6-8-rgb_front i glaze it and he loads the kiln
0sizinmi6jm_0-8-rgb_front so from standing fold to forward in uttanasana and then step your right leg back behind you into lunge pose take the right heel down to the floor and turn the right toes forty five degrees toward the right then bend your left leg nice and deep and take your hands up to your front knee
0sizinmi6jm_1-8-rgb_front so now what we have to do is get the back leg to do what we call a big inner spiral so that means the inner edge of the back leg needs to move back and widen toward the right in order to get our hips more in alignment
0sizinmi6jm_10-8-rgb_front then bend your front leg nice and deep take your hands to your front knee do big inner spiral in the back leg so to do that bow forward and move your groins back move your thighs back and as they go back you feel the whole left hip will spin around
0sizinmi6jm_11-8-rgb_front then scoop the tail bone down bend the right leg more deeply as the right leg bends lift up through the spine and sweep your arms open to the sky
0sizinmi6jm_13-8-rgb_front and release fold forward inhale step forward
0sizinmi6jm_14-8-rgb_front and then push in to your feet take your hands to your hips lift half way up draw the shoulder blades into the back and lift with your heart to rise up standing
0sizinmi6jm_2-8-rgb_front so bow forward and move both of your inner thighs back
0sizinmi6jm_3-8-rgb_front do you see that
0sizinmi6jm_4-8-rgb_front since you move your inner thighs back then draw the tail bone down that is it and then inhale and lift up
0sizinmi6jm_5-8-rgb_front sweep the arms open to the sky and hold for a few more full breaths and surrender your front leg a little more deeply so the front leg is full and brave
0sizinmi6jm_6-8-rgb_front exhale fold forward inhale step forward
0sizinmi6jm_7-8-rgb_front and let is do the second side together
0sizinmi6jm_8-8-rgb_front step your left leg back
0sizinmi6jm_9-8-rgb_front now you can line up the heels in line with each other or if that feels like your hips are a little too tight to do that it is fine to take the left leg a little more toward the left so little wider stance will give you more freedom
0sphvzvqxqy_10-8-rgb_front they pick up a lot quicker they are a lot faster with their speaking physically
0sphvzvqxqy_11-8-rgb_front mixed martial arts is excellent for children because it builds in them
0sphvzvqxqy_12-8-rgb_front the cardiovascular of each movement that they do builds the heart to become stronger in everything that they do within mixed martial arts
0sphvzvqxqy_9-8-rgb_front when you go to school or they learn from in here it becomes essential to them
0ssmkevvetg_0-11-rgb_front hi tom choisnet again this time i am going to talk about filing an extension i am sure at least once in your tax filing career you had the time where you just could not get around getting your things together for the tax guide
0ssmkevvetg_1-11-rgb_front or maybe you waited a little bit to far into april to give the man a call or perhaps he was booked to the wire and you did not know it
0ssmkevvetg_2-11-rgb_front you do not have any fear about that today is extensions are good until october that is right you get automatics month extension to file your taxes and all you have to do is tell your tax man
0ssmkevvetg_3-11-rgb_front you do have to pay any taxes that might be due so give it your best guess and send some money with the extension and you will not have to pay any interest on your late payment
0ssmkevvetg_4-11-rgb_front filing your extension does eliminate the penalty for late filing so if you quit do not have it quit together file that extension and your good until october thank you
0sy5frjh9nw_10-8-rgb_front fluff that up to where you can have something
0sy5frjh9nw_11-8-rgb_front that you can ignite very easily
0sy5frjh9nw_12-8-rgb_front ok you want to get some really small dry wood
0sy5frjh9nw_13-8-rgb_front then you want to start to collect some bigger stuff
0sy5frjh9nw_14-8-rgb_front some stuff that is going to burn a long time
0sy5frjh9nw_15-8-rgb_front try and look for hard woods verses soft woods oaks hickory is maples
0sy5frjh9nw_16-8-rgb_front these are going to burn longer and warmer
0sy5frjh9nw_17-8-rgb_front so that it will help you out in the long run
0sy5frjh9nw_18-8-rgb_front ok then you are going to have to find something to ignite it with
0sy5frjh9nw_19-8-rgb_front some people have sparker is a lighter matches flint and steel
0sy5frjh9nw_20-8-rgb_front if you do not have that you can use two pieces of rock hard rock
0sy5frjh9nw_21-8-rgb_front most of the time they will lay a spark just might take a little longer but first off when you do get lost or stranded
0sy5frjh9nw_22-8-rgb_front you all ways want to make a fire first
0sy5frjh9nw_23-8-rgb_front help you the most in the long run and that is how to build you a speed fire in case you are surviving nature
0sy5frjh9nw_3-8-rgb_front you do not want to be messing around with any other stuff
0sy5frjh9nw_4-8-rgb_front you want to have a fire
0sy5frjh9nw_5-8-rgb_front not only does this give you light it gives you warmth but most of all it gives you that personal feeling of safety
0sy5frjh9nw_6-8-rgb_front knowing that you have a fire around you
0sy5frjh9nw_7-8-rgb_front to build this you are going to look for some small kindling
0sy5frjh9nw_8-8-rgb_front small dry stuff leafs pin straw
0sy5frjh9nw_9-8-rgb_front pull some of the interior of your socks out
0syti1jhaww_0-8-rgb_front so now we have finished the whole uncial alphabet
0syti1jhaww_1-8-rgb_front again it has just lower case no capital letters
0syti1jhaww_10-8-rgb_front maybe we we can not avoid the letters we do not like
0syti1jhaww_11-8-rgb_front so a recommendation might be to write a whole string of letters that one for each letter of the alphabet
0syti1jhaww_12-8-rgb_front and practicing that way
0syti1jhaww_13-8-rgb_front so that you keep your hand in good practice
0syti1jhaww_2-8-rgb_front and i think the best thing to do now is to practice those letters
0syti1jhaww_3_4-8-rgb_front now sometimes when we are practicing we tend to say o k i am going to make five as make your five as etc
0syti1jhaww_5-8-rgb_front but it is not necessarily the best way to practice
0syti1jhaww_6-8-rgb_front i would like to think about putting the letters together with other letters that would be naturally occurring
0syti1jhaww_7-8-rgb_front so we are going to make words
0syti1jhaww_8-8-rgb_front and in practicing words you practice how the letters fit together
0syti1jhaww_9-8-rgb_front and you also practice a bigger assortment of letters
0sal9f4rxey_0-8-rgb_front today we are at deluxe clothing store where we sell resale clothing and local designers fashions and we also do alterations
0sal9f4rxey_1-8-rgb_front and today we are going to demonstrate doing repairs on clothing
0sal9f4rxey_10-8-rgb_front the second loop you do close to the first but not right into the first because it will just pull the thread out
0sal9f4rxey_11-8-rgb_front and i know it is kind of hard to see because we have got matching thread but three loops will lock it into practically any fabric you use whether it be really slippery fabric or really heavy duty fabric
0sal9f4rxey_12-8-rgb_front and i like to mend from the outside because it seems that you can gage how neat it is looking as you are going along
0sal9f4rxey_13-8-rgb_front okay so i have got my loops on the inside and what i am going to do is see where your hole is i like to kind of round up the edges a little bit first to kind of get any loose edges
0sal9f4rxey_14-8-rgb_front and sometimes it is a matter of just kind of reweaving a little hole
0sal9f4rxey_15-8-rgb_front you can do that with a crochet needle if it is a big sweater
0sal9f4rxey_16-8-rgb_front but if it is a little part like this you want to get close but not to close to the edges because then it will just pull out the broken threads
0sal9f4rxey_17-8-rgb_front so you just go from one side over to the other side and pull it taut but do not buckle it
0sal9f4rxey_18-8-rgb_front now i know there is different methods where you can make it look like it is disappearing or if your hole is more length wise you want to do it side to side
0sal9f4rxey_19-8-rgb_front you want to make it kind of blend in as much as possible with the knitting or the grain of the fabric
0sal9f4rxey_2-8-rgb_front and this repair today will be mending a hole in a sweater
0sal9f4rxey_20-8-rgb_front as you can see it is closing up very nicely
0sal9f4rxey_21-8-rgb_front so you want to do it close enough again where you are getting a nice strong bond
0sal9f4rxey_22-8-rgb_front and i am actually kind of at the end of the hole here
0sal9f4rxey_23-8-rgb_front and you can go over it the opposite way too
0sal9f4rxey_24-8-rgb_front if you know the broken thread is right where your fabric is you can also do the i am going to bring my needle back through the back side and you can reinforce it by doing those three loops at the end
0sal9f4rxey_25-8-rgb_front if there is a particularly if there is an area that looks like it is going to unravel more
0sal9f4rxey_26-8-rgb_front but i think this one is pretty successful just doing it once over like this
0sal9f4rxey_27-8-rgb_front you do your three little knots or three not knots you do your three little loops to lock it back into place
0sal9f4rxey_28-8-rgb_front and you do not want to cut your thread super close to the fabric because if there is any pull the first time you wear it it will tend to maybe pull on the first loop
0sal9f4rxey_29-8-rgb_front so you just leave about an eighth of an inch
0sal9f4rxey_3-8-rgb_front so the first thing you want to do is match up your thread and when you do matching threads you make sure you take the thread sample off the spool because it can look completely different than if you just hold the spool up next to it
0sal9f4rxey_30-8-rgb_front and there is our mending
0sal9f4rxey_31-8-rgb_front i mean sometimes it shows more than other times
0sal9f4rxey_32-8-rgb_front you can also set it by kind of pressing it
0sal9f4rxey_33-8-rgb_front stretching a little bit in different directions to make it disappear more into the fabric
0sal9f4rxey_34-8-rgb_front and sometimes just ironing it will help but
0sal9f4rxey_35-8-rgb_front ironing will help to set the part that you kind of pulled taut in there and it will set it down flatter
0sal9f4rxey_36-8-rgb_front so that is just an easy stitching of a hole
0sal9f4rxey_4-8-rgb_front it can look totally off darker or lighter
0sal9f4rxey_5-8-rgb_front so when you take a piece of thread off and hold it against the fabric and it kind of disappears then you know you have got the right color
0sal9f4rxey_6-8-rgb_front so you just take a length of thread not too long because the longer it is the more it tends to knot
0sal9f4rxey_7-8-rgb_front and i personally do not use knots because they can wear off pull out
0sal9f4rxey_8-8-rgb_front so i use three little loops to start my sewing
0sal9f4rxey_9-8-rgb_front and you can start by doing just three tiny little places
0sat-ibig34_0-11-rgb_front in this clip i am going to be showing you how to make transitions between your cuts and your videos before putting them on dvd
0sat-ibig34_1-11-rgb_front i will be using windows movie maker but you can use what ever application you want
0sat-ibig34_10-11-rgb_front this one looks cool and now we can watch it back and see
0sat-ibig34_11-11-rgb_front so i will just go back to the time line and move the head right in front of where its will happen and play the footage and you can see
0sat-ibig34_12-11-rgb_front there is one moving it forward here and there is another and that one is kind of of cool
0sat-ibig34_13-11-rgb_front ok so that is how the transitions work
0sat-ibig34_14-11-rgb_front going back to story board here if you want to delete one just right click and hit delete or you can copy it and move it over to another clip or you can play it
0sat-ibig34_15-11-rgb_front a bunch of options so that is how you use video transitions in windows movie maker while editing
0sat-ibig34_2-11-rgb_front windows movie making is a trademark of microsoft a company of which i have not affiliation with what so ever
0sat-ibig34_3-11-rgb_front ok so we are in windows movie maker again and i have already imported a clip and have split it up and made a couple cuts here here and here
0sat-ibig34_4-11-rgb_front so we are going to add some transitions so what you do is go to story board mode by clicking right here and you will see each of these clips
0sat-ibig34_5-11-rgb_front you will also see these boxes in between these clips that represent a cut in each of these boxes
0sat-ibig34_6-11-rgb_front so what you want to do is put a transition here
0sat-ibig34_7-11-rgb_front you can find transitions by going to the tab and clicking video transitions or you can go to tools and find them right here you get a bunch of transitions here
0sat-ibig34_8-11-rgb_front you just pick one to select hold it down with the mouse and drop it in the box
0sat-ibig34_9-11-rgb_front i will just choose some random ones here
0seuqtcvf_e_0-5-rgb_front hi this is yolanda from vanveenbulbs com and in this section we are going to talk about how to control corn ear worms
0seuqtcvf_e_1-5-rgb_front now there is all types of bugs that affect our crops in the united states and a big problem right now for all the corn industries is the corn ear worm
0seuqtcvf_e_11-5-rgb_front so even if something is marked organic it might still be dangerous to other animals and to different pets and other bugs
0seuqtcvf_e_12-5-rgb_front so always do your research and find out and try the most natural methods first
0seuqtcvf_e_2-5-rgb_front basically it really is a caterpillar that gets into the corn and then makes a little cocoon and then turns into a moth
0seuqtcvf_e_3-5-rgb_front it eats into the corn and does terrible damage and so it can ruin a whole crop but there is different types of methods that you can use to rid the corn fields of the corn ear worms
0sff0qsiabw_1-8-rgb_front we are getting ready to assemble our button mirror now
0sff0qsiabw_10-8-rgb_front this is a little magnet you can stick on here
0sff0qsiabw_11-8-rgb_front you can put them on little stands and have them to people take wedding pictures from people and put it on their soundsa like sign
0sff0qsiabw_12-8-rgb_front so you can make them into a lot of different things once you get going
0sff0qsiabw_13-8-rgb_front but mirrors i found that most people like them the best
0sff0qsiabw_14-8-rgb_front so now we are going to put it in here assemble it up
0sff0qsiabw_15-8-rgb_front first we put in our hologram paper then we put in our newly designed and colored transparency
0sff0qsiabw_16-8-rgb_front now we put a piece of miter over on it
0sff0qsiabw_17-8-rgb_front this holds it together and keeps it from falling apart once it goes into the press and then we just press it down
0sff0qsiabw_18-8-rgb_front that is stage one
0sff0qsiabw_2-8-rgb_front i just want to let you know these things come in all different sizes and shapes from one inch all the way up to six inch
0sff0qsiabw_3-8-rgb_front also i want to mention when i cut this this is tempered glass and if you want to get a good smooth cut always cut on tempered glass
0sff0qsiabw_4-8-rgb_front it will not dull your blade
0sff0qsiabw_5-8-rgb_front if you noticed this is just a razorblade and it will not dull the razorblade
0sff0qsiabw_6-8-rgb_front if you cut on regular glass it is going to dull your blade really quick and will ruin it fast
0sff0qsiabw_7-8-rgb_front so now we are getting ready to put this into our device in our button press
0sff0qsiabw_8-8-rgb_front first thing we need this is called a shell and we will put it in assemble here
0sff0qsiabw_9-8-rgb_front with this you can make buttons mirrors
0syi-83qsvm_0-8-rgb_front hello
0syi-83qsvm_10-8-rgb_front wood peckers and gold finches typically have a very strongly undulating flight as they travel
0syi-83qsvm_11-8-rgb_front other birds like the eastern king bird typically fly on the tips of their wings and have a very peculiar flickering flight swallows like these purple martins off to my left here skim and swoop so these would all be behavioral features that would be very useful in helping you identify an unfamiliar bird
0syi-83qsvm_12-8-rgb_front in general when we first see a bird we want to try and put it into some sort of a category
0syi-83qsvm_13-8-rgb_front this of course can be based on the way birds are classified and in fact in most of the popular field guides today birds are actually grouped and organized based on their scientific classification
0syi-83qsvm_14-8-rgb_front if we start with the water birds which typically occur first in the taxonomic higher arky that is typical of most field guides we are obviously looking at fairly large birds
0syi-83qsvm_15-8-rgb_front many of which in deed are associated with wetlands as appose to many of the forest and woodland birds that would be much smaller and would obviously be more settle in terms of some of their identification characteristics
0syi-83qsvm_16-8-rgb_front so as we move forward through some of these different groups of birds we would be using different characteristics and different features as we begin to put them into categories that can be useful for field identification
0syi-83qsvm_2-8-rgb_front my name is wayne peterson and i am the director of the important bird areas program for the massachusetts audubon society
0syi-83qsvm_3-8-rgb_front today we are here at the daniel webster wildlife sanctuary in marshfield massachusetts where we will be talking about bird identification and some of the equipment and essential tools that are useful to get one started in this incredibly interesting pastime
0syi-83qsvm_4-8-rgb_front one of the things that is very important as we begin to think about identifying birds in the field is to sort of understand what we need to look for
0syi-83qsvm_5-8-rgb_front we mentioned briefly the topographical features of the bird but there are other things in addition to the physical appearance of the bird
0syi-83qsvm_6-8-rgb_front for example habit
0syi-83qsvm_7-8-rgb_front we are in a meadow here at daniel webster wildlife sanctuary where we have a pond behind me and fields and meadows in this direction so that obviously there are certain birds that we can reasonably expect in these kinds of habitats
0syi-83qsvm_8-8-rgb_front at the same time we can use behavior
0syi-83qsvm_9-8-rgb_front for example the way a bird flies
0t19eyswpyg_0-8-rgb_front now that you have the focal flowers in the next thing we need to do is to add some accent flowers along with this
0t19eyswpyg_1-8-rgb_front one of the things that is the best to do and to help keep the cost down on doing flower arrangements in silk is you buy a bush
0t19eyswpyg_10-8-rgb_front but you need to put some color in there as well so it looks good from a distance
0t19eyswpyg_11-8-rgb_front okay and the other thing is is this is a typical different flower
0t19eyswpyg_12-8-rgb_front we are going to start adding texture to it and that will be another part of the filler flowers that we add
0t19eyswpyg_13-8-rgb_front so right now what we are doing is putting in filler to support the main rose flowers
0t19eyswpyg_14-8-rgb_front and that is the end of this step
0t19eyswpyg_2-8-rgb_front which is consistent of flowers together coming down to one stem and then you can cut them apart
0t19eyswpyg_3-8-rgb_front so what you try to do is you cut your flowers to a reasonable length that you think will work in the bridal bouquet
0t19eyswpyg_4-8-rgb_front and you can start placing them in supporting the look of your focal flowers
0t19eyswpyg_5-8-rgb_front and the other positive thing about doing silk flowers is that you can just bend and arrange them any which way you like
0t19eyswpyg_6-8-rgb_front fresh flowers it is basically god is made them and you have just got to work with what he is given you to do it
0t19eyswpyg_7-8-rgb_front you need to make sure that you are keeping an eye on the fact that this is going to be rounded or seen also from the side
0t19eyswpyg_8-8-rgb_front so we need to make sure that the side is covered as well
0t19eyswpyg_9-8-rgb_front but this is usually what you use with the smaller flowers and your greeneries
0t4o9jmywao_0-11-rgb_front along with your considerations for what you will want to buy as a telescope you will also want to spend some time wondering what you are going to look at
0t4o9jmywao_1-11-rgb_front how you are going to find it
0t4o9jmywao_10-11-rgb_front another one go to your local book store find atlas cards peterson is field guide to the stars and planets norton is guide to the stars
0t4o9jmywao_11-11-rgb_front there are several excellent books but you will want to know what you want to look at with your telescope before you actually purchase the telescope
0t4o9jmywao_12-11-rgb_front there may be some advantages that you do not know until you know what you want to study
0t4o9jmywao_2-11-rgb_front this is a very inexpensive and wonderful device called a planisphere
0t4o9jmywao_3-11-rgb_front this shows what stars are up at what time of night
0t4o9jmywao_4-11-rgb_front it is very simple to use
0t4o9jmywao_5-11-rgb_front you find your date on the outside
0t4o9jmywao_6-11-rgb_front this ring goes to set for what time it is
0t4o9jmywao_7-11-rgb_front put the time on the date and you have a complete picture of what is up in the night sky at that time
0t4o9jmywao_8-11-rgb_front this one is for northern hemisphere they are also made for people for the southern hemisphere
0t4o9jmywao_9-11-rgb_front be sure and get the right one for your hemisphere
0t7zbqhtvam_0-5-rgb_front alright now we have planted the lettuce we have mulched it in we have covered it we have done all the things that we should do to make it easy and simple
0t7zbqhtvam_1-5-rgb_front and now we are going to harvest some lettuce
0t7zbqhtvam_2-5-rgb_front and i start with my bucket of water because as you are harvesting lettuce it is always good to let the lettuce soak in some good clean water first after you pick it
0t7zbqhtvam_3-5-rgb_front and what we are going for is the small young leaves here very small
0t7zbqhtvam_4-5-rgb_front we are not really in to eating a big mature lettuce we want the lettuce when it is young when it is full of the young nutrients
0t7zbqhtvam_5-5-rgb_front that way when we eat it it will go in to us and create young energized cells instead of eating old lettuce mature lettuce which is at its end of its life which we do not want to eat
0t7zbqhtvam_6-5-rgb_front we want to eat the lettuces when they are in at the beginning of their life
0t7zbqhtvam_7-5-rgb_front that way it is nice and juicy and sweet and good
0t7zbqhtvam_8-5-rgb_front we keep it in the bucket of water
0t7zbqhtvam_9-5-rgb_front we keep it nice and moist from drying out while you are picking your lettuce
0t94zpbiptw_1-8-rgb_front so with the roasting of the garlic what i like to do is just cook it for like ten minutes
0t94zpbiptw_10-8-rgb_front you got your roasted garlic and believe me this roasted garlic is gonna be wonderful you are gonna love it
0t94zpbiptw_11-8-rgb_front and that is how it is
0t94zpbiptw_2-8-rgb_front i take it out and what i do then is i just get some tin foil and i actually wrap them up like a baked potato then
0t94zpbiptw_3-8-rgb_front the reason i like to cook them first in the oven it opens up and releases the flavors of the garlic
0t94zpbiptw_4-8-rgb_front so i am gonna just add one like that
0t94zpbiptw_5-8-rgb_front again i am gonna add a little bit more olive oil to it just a little sprinkle of olive oil like this
0t94zpbiptw_6-8-rgb_front what you are gonna do is wrap it up like this but you are gonna leave the top open just like that
0t94zpbiptw_7-8-rgb_front you are gonna put one there and you are gonna do all three of them and put them in your oven and leave them for about another or minutes depending
0t94zpbiptw_8-8-rgb_front again so here we are just gonna show you real quick
0t94zpbiptw_9-8-rgb_front put it in here gonna wrap it up gonna add just a little more olive oil real simple and put it here and what you are gonna do then is just open up your oven
0tkybkbxuv0_0-8-rgb_front john carstarphen hi
0tkybkbxuv0_2-8-rgb_front applying customized image maps to props and figures in poser is a great way to change the look of things and to give your scenes a really unique flavor
0tkybkbxuv0_3-8-rgb_front but making those texture maps can be kind of a challenge and when you go to setup a new texture it helps to see all the geometry of the item that you are texturing
0tkybkbxuv0_4-8-rgb_front so to help with that many content creators provide templates or seam guides to show where to put what part of the texture
0tkybkbxuv0_5-8-rgb_front and here is an example of a typical seam guide
0tkybkbxuv0_6-8-rgb_front not all poser items come with templates though
0tkybkbxuv0_7-8-rgb_front and using the original image maps as a guide while it is better than nothing can be really frustrating
0tkybkbxuv0_8-8-rgb_front there is a utility that was developed to setup mapping data on polygonal structures to help in creating texture maps or image maps and it is called uvmapper
0tkybkbxuv0_9-8-rgb_front it is a free program or a free version of it can be downloaded here
0tzfbzet80m_0-5-rgb_front hi i am les whitley i would like to talk to you about measuring your pulse using your hand while training or running
0tzfbzet80m_1-5-rgb_front there are a lot of different ways to measure your pulse through heart rate monitors or chest straps that you wear or monitors you wear around your wrist
0tzfbzet80m_10-5-rgb_front training utilizing heart rate or your pulse rate is a great way to measure your progress the level of intensity as well as how you are improving through your training
0tzfbzet80m_2-5-rgb_front if you do not have access to any of those training tools simply using your hands to measure your pulse is an effective way to gage your training
0tzfbzet80m_3-5-rgb_front using your two middle fingers on the radial side of your hand it is where the thumb is located slightly through the indentation press those two fingers lightly to begin to feel your pulse
0tzfbzet80m_4-5-rgb_front while running you can actually palpate and feel your pulse a lot easier because it is beating at a lot faster rate but it is also beating more intensely so you are more likely to feel that
0tzfbzet80m_5-5-rgb_front the other way is feeling at the cardial artery in the neck it is slightly below on either side of the windpipe pressing gently
0tzfbzet80m_6-5-rgb_front now issues with this are pressing too hard that may cause constricting or restriction of blood flow to the brain especially while exercising could compromise that blood flow to the point where you become light headed or even pass out
0tzfbzet80m_7-5-rgb_front so the radial pulse becomes a more popular way to check
0tzfbzet80m_8-5-rgb_front ways to check the pulse you can actually do it for minute which gives you your beats per minute or you can do it for seconds multiply that by which gives you the second count or you can do it for seconds multiply it by which again gets you that second or the beats per minute
0tzfbzet80m_9-5-rgb_front during a fast race the less time that you have to spend taking your pulse so utilizing the second version will actually minimize the time that it takes for you to get an accurate reading
0t_nltnzdsg_1-8-rgb_front now in this clip going to talk about vitamins
0t_nltnzdsg_2-8-rgb_front studies have shown that although there are no real known causes of this particular syndrome some research is saying a certain deficiency in vitamins and minerals can actually produce add to higher chance of getting this syndrome
0t_nltnzdsg_3-8-rgb_front so folic acid and folic acid and iron deficiency can put you at added risk of getting restless leg syndrome so in your diet even if you get restless leg syndrome
0t_nltnzdsg_4-8-rgb_front good to make sure that you also get your daily recommended supplements or intake of vitamins and minerals
0t_nltnzdsg_5-8-rgb_front so in the local drug store or super markets you can get ready available as shown here a lot of these products
0t_nltnzdsg_6-8-rgb_front its readily available here we have a bottle of folic acid and you should also make sure that you get your recommended daily dose and that will also help to alleviate symptoms of restless leg syndrome multi vitamins because a lot of these products have iron included into them but besides taking these supplements its recommended that you take it in from natural foods
0t_nltnzdsg_7-8-rgb_front so make sure that you eat a lot of foods that contain iron like liver you know the greens the green vegetables contain iron and folic as well
0t_nltnzdsg_8-8-rgb_front so besides taking in supplements and taking it from the food and the way that you cook your food as well maintain that the benefits are in tact before you eat it
0t_nltnzdsg_9-8-rgb_front so restless leg syndrome can be prevented or reduced instances by making sure you have the daily intake of the recommended daily vitamins and minerals
0ta2ddezba0_0-8-rgb_front o k so the next thing that we are going to do is called an in and out and i am going to show the ladies their footwork
0ta2ddezba0_1-8-rgb_front basically this is just a variation of the inside turn footwork that you learned before
0ta2ddezba0_10-8-rgb_front it goes back rock change direction and turn six seven basic one two three five six seven
0ta2ddezba0_2-8-rgb_front so all we are going to do is change directions
0ta2ddezba0_3-8-rgb_front so instead of going one two three and doing our inside turn this way now we are going to go one two change directions and do the inside turn back the way we came five six seven one two three
0ta2ddezba0_4-8-rgb_front so we do our back rock on one two instead of coming together on three we are going to step out to the side putting all our weight on the right foot sticking that hip out a little bit
0ta2ddezba0_5-8-rgb_front kind of like you are standing at the bus stop
0ta2ddezba0_6-8-rgb_front alright
0ta2ddezba0_7-8-rgb_front so this is three now we are going to go back this way exactly the same inside turn footwork
0ta2ddezba0_8-8-rgb_front so we are going to start with our left foot turn left right left and basic back rock together so you end up facing the same way that you started
0ta2ddezba0_9-8-rgb_front one more time all together
0tbzon0v4oe_0-8-rgb_front okay folks in this clip i am going to teach you how to draw a capuchin monkey
0tbzon0v4oe_1-8-rgb_front i am going to start right here and we are going to do what first of all i would describe as just the basic outer proportions and dimensions of the monkey itself
0tbzon0v4oe_10-8-rgb_front and we will get to those in a second along with the feet
0tbzon0v4oe_11-8-rgb_front now we are going to go back to the head right here because that is going to be one of the more important parts
0tbzon0v4oe_12-8-rgb_front now the first thing that you are going to want to do is the eyes i think
0tbzon0v4oe_13-8-rgb_front and if you are drawing a cartoon obviously you can do this a wide variety of ways but i will tell you one characteristic that this monkey has his eyes are very dark
0tbzon0v4oe_14-8-rgb_front most monkeys have very dark eyes if you have noticed
0tbzon0v4oe_15-8-rgb_front you do not see a lot of white in any of their eyes
0tbzon0v4oe_16-8-rgb_front so if i were you i would fill up most of his eye with black just to kind of give it the right effect
0tbzon0v4oe_17-8-rgb_front then of course add a little personality he goes kind of come up in the angle of his eyebrows a little bit
0tbzon0v4oe_2-8-rgb_front start by drawing sort of an odd oval shape which will be the foundation for your head
0tbzon0v4oe_26-8-rgb_front the furry part being over here
0tbzon0v4oe_27-8-rgb_front just like that
0tbzon0v4oe_28-8-rgb_front now we have got his back kind of going already so kind of come down here and draw the fur along side his back coming up here and give him a tail
0tbzon0v4oe_29-8-rgb_front another distinct characteristic i would say
0tbzon0v4oe_3-8-rgb_front then come in and we are going to draw his back kind of coming on down like that that will be the top back part of his body
0tbzon0v4oe_30-8-rgb_front you do not have to make that as hairy if you do not want to
0tbzon0v4oe_31-8-rgb_front now to add detail tot he feet just kind of come in here along the bottom hands same way
0tbzon0v4oe_32-8-rgb_front these capuchin monkeys do not really have large hands they have little bit smaller limbs
0tbzon0v4oe_33-8-rgb_front so you do not have to add quite the length that you would add to say a gorilla or any other monkey really
0tbzon0v4oe_34-8-rgb_front because a lot of them i mean they do use their hands for climbing but capuchin monkeys a little bit smaller hands
0tbzon0v4oe_35-8-rgb_front they are kind of like spider monkeys
0tbzon0v4oe_36-8-rgb_front and that is pretty much it
0tbzon0v4oe_37-8-rgb_front if you got that down you have got yourself a nice little capuchin monkey
0tbzon0v4oe_4-8-rgb_front and as you are doing this especially with free features it is okay if you do not draw a perfectly smooth straight lines like i did right here
0tbzon0v4oe_5-8-rgb_front simply because you know a lot of times you are going to be feeling out the design and there is nothing wrong with kind of experimenting while you feel it out
0tbzon0v4oe_6-8-rgb_front this line right here is going to be his leg and it is going to kind of come behind what will be his arm
0tbzon0v4oe_7-8-rgb_front so we are going to kind of draw it in like that
0tbzon0v4oe_8-8-rgb_front and monkey is often times will be found sitting in more squatted positions so it is okay to kind of draw them that way
0tbzon0v4oe_9-8-rgb_front make his arm kind of come out like that both of them will kind of be resting right out in front of him
0tbwqarwkw8_10-4-rgb_front when you are changing tires just remove the tire put the tire back on the jack is capable of holding the vehicle but it does not give a real stable sturdy environment that allows us to work under the vehicle
0tbwqarwkw8_11-4-rgb_front so if you are unfamiliar just check your owner is manual and that will give the information on the jacking points
0tbwqarwkw8_12-4-rgb_front on this particular vehicle the scissors jack is made to fit into a notch in the front and it is just behind the wheel right there and you will find a large metal seam that runs down and that seam will run vertical and it places right in that notch there and you are just going to crank it upward in position and it will fit into that notch to raise the vehicle
0tbwqarwkw8_13-4-rgb_front now before we jack we want to make sure that we have the vehicle in park and the emergency brake is set which we have done in earlier segments
0tbwqarwkw8_14-4-rgb_front okay
0tbwqarwkw8_15-4-rgb_front in jacking the vehicle to make the jack raise you simply crank the nut in the right position
0tbwqarwkw8_16-4-rgb_front you can use your star wrench or the wrench that came with the vehicle
0tbwqarwkw8_17-4-rgb_front but as you will see you can only get so much movement and then you have to remove it and turn it until the jack starts to go up
0tbwqarwkw8_18-4-rgb_front as the jack is going up the scissors collapse and raise the height of this position up to where you will have clearance later
0tbwqarwkw8_19-4-rgb_front but to make it easier if you have got a ratchet from your tool set a socket and a ratchet will make it much easier and quicker to raise the vehicle
0tbwqarwkw8_20-4-rgb_front and just slowly while you watch make sure that your jack goes into the nut
0tbwqarwkw8_21-4-rgb_front there we go
0tbwqarwkw8_22-4-rgb_front i am cranking it clockwise as you see it is connected and it is starting to raise the vehicle
0tbwqarwkw8_23-4-rgb_front as you are jacking up just watch over everything
0tbwqarwkw8_24-4-rgb_front make sure that everything is going smooth
0tbwqarwkw8_25-4-rgb_front and we want to continue to raise the vehicle with this jack just about as high as the jack will get it
0tbwqarwkw8_26-4-rgb_front the higher we can get the more working clearance we are going to have down here once the wheel is removed to get access to the brakes
0tbwqarwkw8_27-4-rgb_front please watch our next segment on the part two of jacking the vehicle
0tbwqarwkw8_3-4-rgb_front one is the jack and that is jack that is most commonly found on most vehicles today for the emergency jack for lifting the vehicle for changing a tire
0tbwqarwkw8_5-4-rgb_front so i will go through this method of using this jack and in the second method we will cover with a floor jack and go over the benefits of that and an floor jack and the different applications for it
0tbwqarwkw8_6-4-rgb_front so in this segment we will cover jacking the vehicle with your emergency or spare tire jack that comes with the vehicle
0tbwqarwkw8_7-4-rgb_front okay
0tbwqarwkw8_8-4-rgb_front if you are unfamiliar with your car or have not jacked it up before the jacking procedure can be found in the owner is manual and that is usually found in your dual box and you can go in there in reference and it will show you exactly where to place the jack and how to use it correctly to raise your vehicle
0tbwqarwkw8_9-4-rgb_front the only exception we have is we are going to use the jack to raise your vehicle and then we are going to put blocks underneath it and lower it back down and set it on the blocks or a jack stand and that is going to provide as a stable platform to work on the vehicle with
0trr2uc5l5m_1-11-rgb_front hi now we are going to get ready for the gravy
0trr2uc5l5m_10-11-rgb_front i am going to pour it into the turkey neck
0trr2uc5l5m_11-11-rgb_front i am going to bring it to a boil
0trr2uc5l5m_12-11-rgb_front after it has come to a boil i am going to turn the heat down to a simmer put a lid on it and simmer it for two hours
0trr2uc5l5m_13-11-rgb_front skimming it every so often
0trr2uc5l5m_14-11-rgb_front this will make stock four and a half cups of stock for your gravy
0trr2uc5l5m_2-11-rgb_front we are going to coat our turkey neck with oil
0trr2uc5l5m_3-11-rgb_front both sides we are going to rub it with salt and pepper
0trr2uc5l5m_4-11-rgb_front we are going to turn your stove and your pan on to moderately high heat
0trr2uc5l5m_5-11-rgb_front we are going to put it in the pan
0trr2uc5l5m_6-11-rgb_front and brown it for about three minutes on one side the turkey neck and then we are going to flip it over turn the heat down to moderate heat brown the other side for ten minutes and then we will get ready to put in our stock
0trr2uc5l5m_7-11-rgb_front we are cooking the turkey neck for three minutes till slightly brown on one side then flip it over cook it for ten minutes on the other side
0trr2uc5l5m_8-11-rgb_front and turn the heat down to a moderate heat for ten minutes
0trr2uc5l5m_9-11-rgb_front hi now it is time to add the remaining six cups of stock
0txiltdyazk_0-11-rgb_front hi
0txiltdyazk_10-11-rgb_front this time i am just going to make this one disappear
0txiltdyazk_11-11-rgb_front put your finger and thumb together let the elastic roll off into a little knot
0txiltdyazk_12-11-rgb_front a little bit of magic and it is gone
0txiltdyazk_2-11-rgb_front i am going to show you some easy to do magic ticks that you can perform at work
0txiltdyazk_3-11-rgb_front once you have done the rubber band finger cuff trick and everybody is recovering from the shock and awe of the illusion drop one of the elastics when they are not looking
0txiltdyazk_4-11-rgb_front then take fingers put them through the remaining elastic and twist
0txiltdyazk_5-11-rgb_front then take your thumb go underneath the whole thing up and around into that little bundle from the left hand
0txiltdyazk_6-11-rgb_front pull out your middle finger then go back into this position
0txiltdyazk_7-11-rgb_front now it looks exactly there is elastics just like the previous trick
0txiltdyazk_8-11-rgb_front make a big deal about it
0txiltdyazk_9-11-rgb_front then say well this time we are going to change it up a bit
0tyxkl8uzy4_0-8-rgb_front remember when i told you it was so hard to collect barbie dolls and the sense of knowing exactly all the different barbie is that are out there
0tyxkl8uzy4_1-8-rgb_front one of the things that is difficult to do is remember which barbie dolls you have when shopping so the best way to do that is to create your own list
0tyxkl8uzy4_10-8-rgb_front you can do around the barbie is to actually see how many you bought in the you know last month or how much your spending on your barbie doll collection or you know what years that your majority barbie doll collection is
0tyxkl8uzy4_11-8-rgb_front you can actually keep track of all that information right in the computer and in addition to that there is another place that you can store information besides tracking it yourself on excel spreadsheet
0tyxkl8uzy4_12-8-rgb_front if you go out to barbiecollector com it is actually a website by mattel that allows you to track and keep track of all your barbie dolls online with mattel to actually let you store your collection
0tyxkl8uzy4_2-8-rgb_front i have my own tracking list that i actually have on microsoft excel on my computer and i keep up with the barbie doll and the value of what the barbie doll is worth
0tyxkl8uzy4_3-8-rgb_front for example you can look at name of my doll where that doll is so for example my first one kelly club santa clause and then it will say the year that it was made which i found on the bottom of my box
0tyxkl8uzy4_4-8-rgb_front the third column consist of the nationality so for instance you get buy certain barbie dolls like caroling fun actually come in african american doll the same as a blonde doll
0tyxkl8uzy4_5-8-rgb_front so you need to know specifically which one you have so i would mark as caucasian blonde cause some of them might be brunette as well as red heads
0tyxkl8uzy4_6-8-rgb_front so you have to keep track of that and then if it is a series i put that on there it it is a pink label or some set of series at if dolls came in that you want to track and keep that there as well
0tyxkl8uzy4_7-8-rgb_front and then the doll type because sometimes i say more than just barbie i save here friends as well like ken kelly and christy and all those people that come as her friends
0tyxkl8uzy4_8-8-rgb_front so you need to keep track of all that and then the dollar value what that barbie doll is worth
0tyxkl8uzy4_9-8-rgb_front so this is an example like i said of the list of the tracking list that you can keep track of you can actually even do a database on your computer if you so desire if you know access database or some of the other types of applications that are out there
0u83zskrpt0_0-8-rgb_front so here you have the possibility to look inside this kind of chipper shredder
0u83zskrpt0_1-8-rgb_front and you see here there is still some of the mulch is sticking here
0u83zskrpt0_10-8-rgb_front so that will be the movement but much faster when the thing is running
0u83zskrpt0_11-8-rgb_front and normally after five to ten hours it depends on how hot your wood is you just open the screws you remove this knife here that is a two bladed knife so you can one times just turn it around and use it on the other side
0u83zskrpt0_12-8-rgb_front but when both sides are not sharp any more i use a little grinder and grind the edges again until they are sharp
0u83zskrpt0_2-8-rgb_front and you look here it has four knives and you see the knives here they are on this part they are very sharp
0u83zskrpt0_3-8-rgb_front and when the material comes in here and this thing is turning then it cuts chip by chip off the wood that is coming in here
0u83zskrpt0_4-8-rgb_front so you should be very careful with your hands if the hand the finger would come in here it would cut as fast as wood chip
0u83zskrpt0_5-8-rgb_front so and this thing here is solid metal and weighs over two hundred and fifty pounds
0u83zskrpt0_6-8-rgb_front because with a spin it is able to cut even logs up to eight inches
0u83zskrpt0_7-8-rgb_front because there is a lot of physical power in a wheel spinning with over two thousand pounds per minute
0u83zskrpt0_8-8-rgb_front and each of these knives comes down there and cuts the wood in pieces
0u83zskrpt0_9-8-rgb_front and because of these air handlers here there is a wind produced that goes in there goes around and then blows like a you saw before blows the material the cut material out of the chimney and blows it in the direction you want to have it
0ucakkqopsk_0-8-rgb_front hi this is yolanda vanveen of vanveenbulbs com
0ucakkqopsk_1-8-rgb_front we are going to talk about how to fix bad soil
0ucakkqopsk_10-8-rgb_front you are not going to be able to fix it no matter what you do
0ucakkqopsk_11-8-rgb_front you can add some compost to it you can add some potting soil to it but in the end you are still going to have good soil mixed with bad soil so work on top of it
0ucakkqopsk_12-8-rgb_front work with a big area maybe dig some of the bad soil out and put some good soil on top
0ucakkqopsk_13-8-rgb_front you can buy compost you can buy potting soil or you can buy compost or potting soil at pretty much any local garden center and it might be a little bit of money but you can buy a big truck load for not really in the scheme of things a whole lot of money
0ucakkqopsk_14-8-rgb_front think about how much money you put into your property and just for a few flower beds just a couple truck loads of dirt even one bag of dirt if you live in a little condo you can have a gorgeous garden
0ucakkqopsk_15-8-rgb_front so i really love raised beds and this is just composted soil that we had delivered and we put it in with a wooden bed and underneath is just rock hard compacted gravel and soil
0ucakkqopsk_16-8-rgb_front there is really underneath it is pretty nothing is going to grow underneath it
0ucakkqopsk_17-8-rgb_front but it is great because we are on a slope and it is good drainage we are making a raised bed
0ucakkqopsk_18-8-rgb_front i am getting the heat of the sun coming in and everything is going to do really well
0ucakkqopsk_19-8-rgb_front you can fix your poor soil by putting good soil on top of it so even the worst clay or sand if you put compost or potting soil on top of it it will work its way down and a lot of times it will gradually break everything up and as the plants grow and they have their healthy roots into the good soil the roots will eventually get into the bad soil and enrich it as well
0ucakkqopsk_2-8-rgb_front everybody comes to me and i have had the same problem all i have is clay everything is rock hard
0ucakkqopsk_20-8-rgb_front so pretty much there is no excuse that you can not plant there or if i have bad soil i have good soil i have bad soil in my yard i work with both and either way i have a gorgeous garden
0ucakkqopsk_3-8-rgb_front i can not get anything to grow
0ucakkqopsk_4-8-rgb_front i live at the beach all i have is sand can i grow right in sand what do i do or i live up in the mountains with just rocks i have nothing but rocks so how do i grow plants in these conditions
0ucakkqopsk_5-8-rgb_front so my theory on all of that is do not fix it
0ucakkqopsk_6-8-rgb_front work on top of it or dig some of it out and put some good soil in
0ucakkqopsk_7-8-rgb_front it does not matter what you have it is going to be good on the bottom so especially clay or sand it is great
0ucakkqopsk_8-8-rgb_front well clay has drainage in the fact that if you put a big raised bed above it the water will just kind of go underneath the clay and leave the bag so your plant is pretty much just going to stay dry because they are up above the clay or if you have sand there is great drainage there so you do not have good soil so if you put a raised bed on top of that sand then you have got great soil with great drainage and everything is going to do really well
0ucakkqopsk_9-8-rgb_front so pretty much you cannot fix your bad soil give it up
0uxfgfpbdwc_0-11-rgb_front hello my name is scott and i am the owner of climb on
0uxfgfpbdwc_1-11-rgb_front indoor rock climbing gym in wilmington north carolina
0uxfgfpbdwc_10-11-rgb_front this has been how to buy a portable climbing wall
0uxfgfpbdwc_2-11-rgb_front today we are going to discuss buying a portable climbing wall
0uxfgfpbdwc_6-11-rgb_front buying a portable wall can be done by finding a climbing manufacturer like entre prises or nicros these are just two companies that sell these types of walls
0upacipisia_10-3-rgb_front you can check with your doctor your chiropractor your physical therapist or another health professional to help you with these things
0upacipisia_4-3-rgb_front these unlike an electric wire the electric conduction on a nerve bounces on the outside kind of like a kangaroo jumping
0ur0rx4qjyu_1-11-rgb_front today i would be explaining to you how to make a garment bag
0ur0rx4qjyu_10-11-rgb_front it would make a nice gift for someone so these are nice ideas for gifts for people of all ages both male and female
0ur0rx4qjyu_2-11-rgb_front the one that we are making today would be for a young girl who might be carrying her clothes back and forth to a friends house or to visit with grandmother or something
0ur0rx4qjyu_3-11-rgb_front she might want to cover up what she is taking so it would not get dirty
0ur0rx4qjyu_4-11-rgb_front this is the fabric that we would be using today a nice bright color for a young girl
0ur0rx4qjyu_5-11-rgb_front but other choices that you might want to consider these are other varieties of the bright colors but a solid color would work well
0ur0rx4qjyu_6-11-rgb_front denim would work well that would be fine for a young man to carry his clothes in if it was denim
0ur0rx4qjyu_7-11-rgb_front canvas would also work well
0ur0rx4qjyu_8-11-rgb_front any sort of print any kind of trim something to keep the clothes from getting dirty
0ur0rx4qjyu_9-11-rgb_front also sorority girls seem to like something to cover all the garments that they need from one event to the next
0v1xivz_gzm_0-8-rgb_front my name is anthony maddaloni and i am going to be talking about photography lighting accessories
0v1xivz_gzm_1-8-rgb_front now photography lighting accessories can run in a whole range of photographic items that you can use
0v1xivz_gzm_10-8-rgb_front now certain manufacturers make items that you could put on your flash
0v1xivz_gzm_11-8-rgb_front it is really nice to buy one they cost about bucks but you could also make them out of certain things
0v1xivz_gzm_12-8-rgb_front sometimes i just use old foam board and i make things out of them like that but those are lighting flash lighting accessories that you can use in photography
0v1xivz_gzm_2-8-rgb_front mainly using lighting
0v1xivz_gzm_3-8-rgb_front one is obviously a flash and the other is actually called a radio slave which i used to like to incorporate in my photography a lot
0v1xivz_gzm_4-8-rgb_front now a radio slave is a type of flash that is triggered by frequencies that get put out by the flash on your camera so if i was photographing an event and i wanted a little bit of a fill flash to lighten up the background as my camera flash went off that flash would go off in the background too
0v1xivz_gzm_5-8-rgb_front that was really one of my favorite lighting accessories to use
0v1xivz_gzm_6-8-rgb_front one lighting accessory that you can also use is a sink chord which you can attach to your flash unit so you can hold it off camera
0v1xivz_gzm_7-8-rgb_front now one really cool thing about that is that you can essentially use your flash and you can bounce it off of low ceilings thus not giving such a harsh lighting effect when people use on camera flash
0v1xivz_gzm_8-8-rgb_front those are pretty essential accessories to me
0v1xivz_gzm_9-8-rgb_front another would be like a flash card or a unit that you really can just sort of mount and it diffuses the flash so that it is not as harsh
0v5bte6b2xq_10-8-rgb_front also rob could say no
0v5bte6b2xq_11-8-rgb_front that is preposterous
0v5bte6b2xq_12-8-rgb_front i would never go to the theater
0v5bte6b2xq_13-8-rgb_front i do not like the theater
0v5bte6b2xq_14-8-rgb_front i find it not to be my cup of tea and then he uses cliches to influence and to add a little embellishment to his line and he says big words like preposterous
0v5bte6b2xq_15-8-rgb_front this can give us clues into a character
0v5bte6b2xq_16-8-rgb_front this character might be shy
0v5bte6b2xq_17-8-rgb_front this character might just to explain things and he might be more of an extrovert
0v5bte6b2xq_18-8-rgb_front a character who would say a word like preposterous might just be someone who is kind of pompous
0v5bte6b2xq_19-8-rgb_front these give us clues clues into who the characters are
0v5bte6b2xq_1_2_3_4-8-rgb_front okay we will do an exercise someone asks rob hey rob were you at the theater the other night rob can reply in many ways
0v5bte6b2xq_20-8-rgb_front how they talk gives us clues
0v5bte6b2xq_5-8-rgb_front rob can say no
0v5bte6b2xq_6-8-rgb_front i was not in the theater the other night or rob can say no
0v5bte6b2xq_7-8-rgb_front i do not believe i was
0v5bte6b2xq_8-8-rgb_front i was at home watching tv
0v5bte6b2xq_9-8-rgb_front so this way we have a short response and a long response
0v9vjqebbl8_0-8-rgb_front so you want to know more about belly dancing
0v9vjqebbl8_1-8-rgb_front hi i johanna krynytzky with hip expressions dance studio
0v9vjqebbl8_10-8-rgb_front now belly dancing can be done as a performance art
0v9vjqebbl8_11-8-rgb_front entertainment restaurants weddings all sorts of different parties special events you can have a belly dancer
0v9vjqebbl8_12-8-rgb_front or belly dancing can be done just for yourself personally in your own home in your living room at the dance studio
0v9vjqebbl8_13-8-rgb_front it is really just about expressing yourself and your emotions
0v9vjqebbl8_14-8-rgb_front so belly dancing really is all about that personal expression through using your body
0v9vjqebbl8_2-8-rgb_front so how would you describe belly dancing
0v9vjqebbl8_24-8-rgb_front i am johanna krynytzky with hip expression belly dance studio telling you about belly dancing
0v9vjqebbl8_3-8-rgb_front what is belly dancing really all about
0v9vjqebbl8_4-8-rgb_front it is a dance of celebration
0v9vjqebbl8_5-8-rgb_front it is a dance where you are learning to move around and to be comfortable with your body
0v9vjqebbl8_6-8-rgb_front it is a dance of isolation
0v9vjqebbl8_7-8-rgb_front so it is isolating one part of your body without moving the other part
0v9vjqebbl8_8-8-rgb_front ultimately it is putting altogether in to a dance that is interpreting the music
0v9vjqebbl8_9-8-rgb_front so it is really about the music that inspires you to move
0vdlen7zvua_5-8-rgb_front this one is foldable and my chopsticks that i do not use at times but keep them in the back of the drawer so i am not so i do not have to get there a lot and because of the size of my drawer i mix in all my spoons my soup spoons and my other spoons my regular spoons and just keep them all in one in one piece as well as my salad and my dinner forks
0vdlen7zvua_6-8-rgb_front keep them all in one section of this container so i have a place for my longer knife
0vdlen7zvua_7-8-rgb_front so it is really about organizing i mean everything that we have talked about is really just about organizing it so that it fits your space and it makes sense to you and it is functional and practical
0vhattavsqk_0-8-rgb_front ok here we are right
0vhattavsqk_1-8-rgb_front what you are going to need to know i have been saying it all along
0vhattavsqk_10-8-rgb_front then a hundred left like this
0vhattavsqk_11-8-rgb_front this going to get you more familiar with the unicycle like i was saying before
0vhattavsqk_12-8-rgb_front also in this next step you are going to use the handle
0vhattavsqk_13-8-rgb_front the handle is right here under your seat
0vhattavsqk_14-8-rgb_front you are going to hold onto the handle get yourself adjusted
0vhattavsqk_15-8-rgb_front because a unicycle is going to move every which way
0vhattavsqk_16-8-rgb_front it s going to go forward
0vhattavsqk_17-8-rgb_front it s going to go backwards
0vhattavsqk_18-8-rgb_front its going to go side to side
0vhattavsqk_19-8-rgb_front there is so much balance needed to do this
0vhattavsqk_2-8-rgb_front use a wall or a person to help you learn how to ride a unicycle right
0vhattavsqk_20-8-rgb_front that your going to really want to get comfortable before you actually get going on your unicycle
0vhattavsqk_21-8-rgb_front so sit down on your seat
0vhattavsqk_22-8-rgb_front do your walks
0vhattavsqk_23-8-rgb_front after while start walking with your pedals at three and
0vhattavsqk_24-8-rgb_front this is going to help you get a little more uncomfortable with it
0vhattavsqk_25-8-rgb_front so once you have learned how to do the bottom rocks learn to do the side rocks
0vhattavsqk_26-8-rgb_front and a good one to do is to stand up on it and use your handle to get really familiar with the top of the unicycle here
0vhattavsqk_3-8-rgb_front so we found a wall right here
0vhattavsqk_4-8-rgb_front we have not started rolling yet
0vhattavsqk_5-8-rgb_front we have just gotten up to this wall we got up on our unicycle using our dominate foot at
0vhattavsqk_6-8-rgb_front do your walking exercises here
0vhattavsqk_7-8-rgb_front hundred right
0vhattavsqk_8-8-rgb_front hundred left
0vhattavsqk_9-8-rgb_front then a hundred right like this
0vnfeyst_tq_10-8-rgb_front so you want to have the strap the loop in front and then bring the tail through so that you are pulling back
0vnfeyst_tq_11-8-rgb_front so this is an external rotation
0vehgyskadc_0-8-rgb_front hello i am sifu mallon with the clearwater kung fu center
0vehgyskadc_1-8-rgb_front this is my assistant melissa and this is kick boxing
0vehgyskadc_10-8-rgb_front again with this i am staying stationary right but i am still on my hips and my legs can move in the side to side action
0vehgyskadc_11-8-rgb_front as i am pushing from one side to the other i do not want to straighten my leg completely up but i do want to push a little bit up
0vehgyskadc_12-8-rgb_front up up has this nice twisting action
0vehgyskadc_13-8-rgb_front ok melissa let is go ahead and come forward
0vehgyskadc_14-8-rgb_front and we will do the pad drill with each other
0vehgyskadc_15-8-rgb_front so we start with our feet shoulder width apart
0vehgyskadc_16-8-rgb_front ok our hands are up right i am putting a little bit back
0vehgyskadc_17-8-rgb_front ok now to start the action she is going to turn in this way slightly she is going to allow this hand to kind of roll down a little bit and then fire up
0vehgyskadc_18-8-rgb_front good
0vehgyskadc_19-8-rgb_front now once she makes contact with the pad she is going to left it up here and then the hand is going to come straight back not loop up but straight back to her this way
0vehgyskadc_2-8-rgb_front we are working on pad drills today
0vehgyskadc_20-8-rgb_front and then she is going to fire the other hand straight up and pull it straight in
0vehgyskadc_21-8-rgb_front now she wants to use the body you want to dip the hand a little lower before you punch out that is it
0vehgyskadc_22-8-rgb_front and i am looking for the center
0vehgyskadc_23-8-rgb_front and meeting that hand each time
0vehgyskadc_24-8-rgb_front that is it
0vehgyskadc_25-8-rgb_front good relax
0vehgyskadc_26-8-rgb_front again my elbows are into the body this way and i am working the technique boom this way this way keeping my elbows nice and tight
0vehgyskadc_27-8-rgb_front for the punch you are performing the uppercuts we want to remember to twist a little drop the hand a little low like rotating it and fire up
0vehgyskadc_28-8-rgb_front the hand comes straight back this way the left hand drops down i use the twist this way
0vehgyskadc_29-8-rgb_front so there is a nice counter action with your body so there is a lot of body mechanics going on in these basic drills
0vehgyskadc_3-8-rgb_front the pad drill that we are going to begin with is our uppercut drill
0vehgyskadc_30-8-rgb_front this is basic drill combos kick boxing
0vehgyskadc_4-8-rgb_front ok this one is a stationary drill
0vehgyskadc_5-8-rgb_front ok just going through the action with it
0vehgyskadc_6-8-rgb_front i will start with my feet shoulder width apart
0vehgyskadc_7-8-rgb_front i will twist to my left ok twist to my left and i will fire my left hand up
0vehgyskadc_8-8-rgb_front boom
0vehgyskadc_9-8-rgb_front i bring my left hand to body my left right hand drops down fire to right
0vgvgyijram_1-8-rgb_front of course this is fencing and so the blade does come into play
0vgvgyijram_2-8-rgb_front so when we are protecting ourself one we are looking to protect ourselves with our feet but two we do look to protect ourselves with our blade
0vgvgyijram_3-8-rgb_front this is called parrying
0vgvgyijram_4-8-rgb_front we use our blade to protect ourselves from our opponent is attack it is called parrying
0vgvgyijram_5-8-rgb_front there are several parries depending on where opponent is attacking and what we are trying to do
0vgvgyijram_6-8-rgb_front we may do one of several parries that allow us to stop the opponent is blade and then make a riposte or to hit them after we have protected ourselves
0vgvgyijram_7-8-rgb_front it can be done in place with maneuvering forward backward even sometimes with a lunge depending on the needs and the tactical situation
0vgvgyijram_8-8-rgb_front we will go over three of the most important parries in sabre one at a time and how and when to use them
0vgvgyijram_9-8-rgb_front i will show you these from different angles as well different parries we might use like so
0vmzethevwg_0-8-rgb_front hi i am natanya nielsen from saratoga springs utah
0vmzethevwg_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to talk about crochet basics and we are going to start with the chain stitch
0vmzethevwg_10-8-rgb_front as your chain gets longer simply slide your fingers towards your hook to help hold it stable to help keep your stitches the same length
0vmzethevwg_11-8-rgb_front you want to practice being loose and controlled and relaxed as you do this because the looser your chain is the easier it is to continue your project
0vmzethevwg_2-8-rgb_front we start with a slip stitch
0vmzethevwg_3-8-rgb_front to do your slip stitch you are going to lay your yarn over top of your pinkie wrap it around the back of your hand and grasp it between your middle finger and your thumb
0vmzethevwg_4-8-rgb_front take your hook and lay it underneath your yarn
0vmzethevwg_5-8-rgb_front then you will twist it all the way around grab your yarn with your hook and pull it through the loop
0vmzethevwg_6-8-rgb_front pull that loop tight and you have your slip stitch
0vmzethevwg_7-8-rgb_front to start your chain stitch you are going to grab the yarn with the hook part of your crochet hook then you will pull that through the loop that is already on your hook
0vmzethevwg_8-8-rgb_front and you will have another loop on your hook
0vmzethevwg_9-8-rgb_front you do the same thing over and over again
0vygqtvip-s_0-8-rgb_front so hopefully now that you know how to do the frontwards weave putting it all together into the backwards weave will be a snap
0vygqtvip-s_1-8-rgb_front let is start by split time circles just like we did before and we are going to try one continuous cycle and then going back to split time circles
0vygqtvip-s_10-8-rgb_front think of them going under the other one
0vygqtvip-s_11-8-rgb_front under
0vygqtvip-s_12-8-rgb_front good job
0vygqtvip-s_2-8-rgb_front starting with my right arm
0vygqtvip-s_3-8-rgb_front one whole weave and then back
0vygqtvip-s_4-8-rgb_front so again each hand gets a chance to be on top
0vygqtvip-s_5-8-rgb_front my wrists are moving under each other as they cross
0vygqtvip-s_6-8-rgb_front under
0vygqtvip-s_7-8-rgb_front watch how the writ comes around my hand and under the other one
0vygqtvip-s_8-8-rgb_front this will enable you to do it without your poi crossing and tangling with one another
0vygqtvip-s_9-8-rgb_front if you get confused just come back to split time circles and try again starting with your right hand leading up to your left shoulder and around
0w4x3eb0tvs_0-8-rgb_front this is standard relaxation therapy for the low back
0w4x3eb0tvs_1-8-rgb_front a lot of people have low back problems and the low back is an area that often times does not get as much attention as it deserves
0w4x3eb0tvs_10-8-rgb_front again be careful going across the base of the spine and be careful going across the sacrum as well
0w4x3eb0tvs_11-8-rgb_front you got bone there with not much else then skin on top of it
0w4x3eb0tvs_12-8-rgb_front so if you go too deep there it can cause pain and even bruising
0w4x3eb0tvs_13-8-rgb_front again good deep motion you can get alternate deep strokes going
0w4x3eb0tvs_14-8-rgb_front it helps to warm things up
0w4x3eb0tvs_15-8-rgb_front that is going to be standard relaxation therapy for the low back
0w4x3eb0tvs_2-8-rgb_front as always start by assessing the area that you are working on with just some gentle effleurage
0w4x3eb0tvs_3-8-rgb_front get an idea of the tonal quality of the muscles
0w4x3eb0tvs_4-8-rgb_front low back is easily divided on either side
0w4x3eb0tvs_5-8-rgb_front and it is actually going to work over to the side and into the tops of the hip bones
0w4x3eb0tvs_6-8-rgb_front all those muscles are interconnected
0w4x3eb0tvs_7-8-rgb_front this is an area that once you have warmed it up with some good effleurage you can get deep effleurage going and then get into the even deeper pretissage
0w4x3eb0tvs_8-8-rgb_front the kneading motion
0w4x3eb0tvs_9-8-rgb_front working around to the hip bone and even on to the very top edge of the gluteal muscles
0w7kbbbyrme_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to show you how to do side lying abduction
0w7kbbbyrme_1-8-rgb_front there is standing and then side lying abduction for the outer thigh which is just an extension of the glute in your rear behind you
0w7kbbbyrme_2-8-rgb_front it is not a separate muscle so you are still working behind but we are going to focus on the outside lateral aspect of the thigh
0w7kbbbyrme_3-8-rgb_front bringing and stacking our hips you have got an elbow right underneath the shoulder joint nice square core we do not want anything else to move
0w7kbbbyrme_4-8-rgb_front now if you want to you can come all the way down and rest your head on your arm and we lift exhale inhale down
0w7kbbbyrme_5-8-rgb_front we exhale on contraction which that is the contraction phase on the lift and your forcing that energy shooting it right out through your heal and release
0w7kbbbyrme_6-8-rgb_front exhale inhale exhale inhale
0w7kbbbyrme_7-8-rgb_front now of course you can do this without tubing and get that down pat and then add in variable resistance depending on the thickness of the tubing will depend on how tight the resistance is and how quickly you will become fatigued
0w7kbbbyrme_8-8-rgb_front so contract and release keeping both knees bent and you always have the option for balance purpose to bend your bottom knee if you wish for more stability and then less of a balance challenge for you
0w7kbbbyrme_9-8-rgb_front ten to fifteen reps three sets
0wker2yte2g_0-8-rgb_front when you do not have a dry mount machine then you need to mount something to a piece of matte board
0wker2yte2g_1-8-rgb_front you take a piece of tape preferably a acid free piece of tape
0wker2yte2g_2-8-rgb_front if you do not have a acid free piece of tape go to your medicine cabinet
0wker2yte2g_3-8-rgb_front that white tape is acid free
0wker2yte2g_4-8-rgb_front you lay it down with the glue face up adhere it to the picture like so and place your matte back over the picture where you want it to be
0wker2yte2g_5-8-rgb_front press down on it it will adhere to where it will stick to it
0wker2yte2g_6-8-rgb_front i usually run my thumb over the back of it like so so i can ensure that i get a good set on my tape cause you do not want it to come off later in your picture to fall
0wker2yte2g_7-8-rgb_front place it on top of your foam core that you cut to fit to the size of your frame place the two together
0wn3i0wqzeq_0-8-rgb_front if you have played poker in the last five years chances are you played texas holdem
0wn3i0wqzeq_1-8-rgb_front as popular widespread as fun as texas holdem is it may have actually become pedestrian at this point
0wn3i0wqzeq_2-8-rgb_front you might be bored with texas holdem maybe you have friends that play with that would be redisent to change from the texas holdem cause of it is familiar area cause that is what you learned and you play it all the time
0wn3i0wqzeq_3-8-rgb_front well here is a game that gives you holdem the holdem layout the holdem type game but adds an extra element of skill and even an extra card to holdem
0wpjghjnx-s_0-8-rgb_front hi
0wpjghjnx-s_1-8-rgb_front this is jessica smith with blands nursery in north jordan utah
0wpjghjnx-s_10-8-rgb_front now peonies if you are planting bare root you will want to make sure that you plant the herbaceous types at least two inches below the soil level and the tree types at least four inches below the soil level
0wpjghjnx-s_11-8-rgb_front if you plant a peony too deep it actually will not bloom for you
0wpjghjnx-s_12-8-rgb_front and also if you are using a bare root type or one that somebody is giving you off one that they have just divided remember it may take some time for it to reestablish so it will be a while before it blooms
0wpjghjnx-s_13-8-rgb_front peonies like a full sunny location
0wpjghjnx-s_14-8-rgb_front one of the best things that you can do for your peonies is actually give them support
0wpjghjnx-s_15-8-rgb_front they are so top heavy that those big blooms will actually make them fall over
0wpjghjnx-s_16-8-rgb_front so put a peony cage around them
0wpjghjnx-s_17-8-rgb_front put it down around the plant early enough in the spring so as the plant grows up it will grow through it
0wpjghjnx-s_2-8-rgb_front today we are talking about peonies
0wpjghjnx-s_3-8-rgb_front either pronounced peony or peony depending on what part of the country you are from
0wpjghjnx-s_4-8-rgb_front they are an old time favorite in old fashioned gardens with huge blooms in the springtime and then after they are done blooming it makes a nice little green shrub in any type of a flower bed or a shrub bed
0wpjghjnx-s_5-8-rgb_front there are two types of peonies
0wpjghjnx-s_6-8-rgb_front the herbaceous types that die down to the ground each year and then emerge with new leaves each year or the tree types
0wpjghjnx-s_7-8-rgb_front the tree types are a woody type of a plant more like a flowering shrub
0wpjghjnx-s_8-8-rgb_front both of them produce those huge plants in the spring
0wpjghjnx-s_9-8-rgb_front when planting peonies make sure you prepare the soil with some nice organic matter
0wahxwitlry_0-8-rgb_front what we are going to go over and talk about are the common qualities of the multi purpose or dry chemical fire extinguishers
0wahxwitlry_1-8-rgb_front dry chemical fire extinguisher is a fire extinguisher that will handle all three classes of fire
0wahxwitlry_2-8-rgb_front class a normal everyday combustible like wood paper and cloth
0wahxwitlry_3-8-rgb_front class b flammable liquids and combustible liquids and class c energized electrical equipment
0wahxwitlry_4-8-rgb_front this is the type of fire extinguisher that is commonly found in most places of business and everyone is home
0wahxwitlry_5-8-rgb_front this extinguisher has a gage that it shows you when it is charged and ready to go
0wahxwitlry_6-8-rgb_front it is a one time use fire extinguisher
0wahxwitlry_7-8-rgb_front after it is used it must be recharged to be put back in to operation
0wahxwitlry_8-8-rgb_front this extinguisher however has a disadvantaged it causes a significant amount of dry powder or chemical to be spread throughout the room of origin in the fire
0wahxwitlry_9-8-rgb_front but it is the most versatile fire extinguisher available to us as american citizens
0wf7v55xjvq_0-8-rgb_front there are as many different ways to take of your tattoo as there are tattoos also
0wf7v55xjvq_1-8-rgb_front everybody is got a theory
0wf7v55xjvq_15-8-rgb_front it is easy a little thing of antibacterial soap in your pocket or whatever
0wf7v55xjvq_16-8-rgb_front you go to the bathroom while you are washing your hands go ahead and wash up here too
0wf7v55xjvq_17-8-rgb_front does not hurt anything
0wf7v55xjvq_18-8-rgb_front as far as lubriderm or petroleum based products or all these ointments and salves really the simpler the better
0wf7v55xjvq_19-8-rgb_front less is more
0wf7v55xjvq_2-8-rgb_front the most important thing is just do not pick at it do not scratch at it do not sleep on it and get it stuck to your bed do not let it get stuck to your clothing and do not over do it
0wf7v55xjvq_20-8-rgb_front if you have got a lotion that is heavy in fragrances it is going to burn because it is going to have alcohol in it so it is going to hurt
0wf7v55xjvq_21-8-rgb_front you can use but why would you want to
0wf7v55xjvq_22-8-rgb_front you do not have to smell good
0wf7v55xjvq_23-8-rgb_front you will be healed in or days so it is not a big deal
0wf7v55xjvq_24-8-rgb_front vaseline intensive care lubriderm fragrance free of course
0wf7v55xjvq_25-8-rgb_front all these products work
0wf7v55xjvq_26-8-rgb_front and all of them have a little bit different way of doing it and your artist will give you actually most states require that your artist gives you written instructions as you leave the studio
0wf7v55xjvq_27-8-rgb_front so it might be very different than what you leave with at our studio and each studio probably has their own theory of of how to do that but as long as it is reasonable i say i say follow that
0wf7v55xjvq_3-8-rgb_front there are things you want to look out for when you are healing a tattoo such as cleaning products like if you are cleaning your bathroom and you just got your sleeve done you might not want to get bleach all over your arm
0wf7v55xjvq_4-8-rgb_front thing like that can cause adverse reactions however it is not the end of the world either
0wf7v55xjvq_5-8-rgb_front now of it is life threatening or or or horrifying at all
0wf7v55xjvq_6-8-rgb_front as far as the actual healing goes there is a lot of products on the market
0wf7v55xjvq_7-8-rgb_front we sell a lot of them here at all or nothing
0wfnuu7s92u_0-5-rgb_front hi this is rachael richardson with nutrolution in south beach miami florida
0wfnuu7s92u_1-5-rgb_front in this clip we are talking about how to eliminate the junk foods
0wfnuu7s92u_2-5-rgb_front the most important thing that you do here is you start with healthy grocery shopping and start with planning
0wfnuu7s92u_3-5-rgb_front so knowing what you are going to bring with you and bringing it with you when you are out on the road so that you are not subject to whatever types of restaurants and options that you have
0wfnuu7s92u_4-5-rgb_front so if we are on south beach right here on ocean drive and i do not know if you can see behind me to this direction but there is johnny rockets there is a fat tuesday is and all kinds of other places that we probably can not get any good healthy food from
0wfnuu7s92u_5-5-rgb_front so what i have done in this case is i have brought a few snacks with me a couple transportable snacks that i have brought are an apple a small apple a small pear and i have even also brought a couple of healthy protein bars that are balanced in protein and healthy fat and a little bit of carbohydrates
0wfnuu7s92u_6-5-rgb_front so also keep in mind that you want to stay on the perimeter of the grocery store when you are shopping and these are the best ways to get the junk food out of your diet
0wfnuu7s92u_7-5-rgb_front this is rachael richardson and this has been how to plan to avoid junk food
0wg18ytia28_0-5-rgb_front when you are creating your layers for the vision that happens a lot when you are doing pictures and also when you are kind of building on a theme
0wg18ytia28_1-5-rgb_front so when we started with money does grow on trees it was important for me to really visually express that and verbally express that
0wg18ytia28_10-5-rgb_front so even though this is incredibly materialistic completely superficial and totally because it is just money and has nothing to do with anything but loving money i can still take it in my vision board and bring it to a level where it really means something to me
0wg18ytia28_11-5-rgb_front if i am earning money and people are paying me to sing my music i am communicating something that really means something to me that hopefully will benefit people in the world
0wg18ytia28_12-5-rgb_front and if it is just in time for spring then i am celebrating the world i am celebrating creation
0wg18ytia28_13-5-rgb_front so when you look at what you are putting into the board make sure that you really have an understanding of while you are having fun with it what it really means to you because if you connect into it on an emotional level then it is going to have more meaning for you
0wg18ytia28_14-5-rgb_front and then you are going to be able to have some really cool things show up in your life
0wg18ytia28_2-5-rgb_front so that is why i got pictures of two trees
0wg18ytia28_3-5-rgb_front now i did not just pick one tree because one is not exactly what it says
0wg18ytia28_4-5-rgb_front you want to be very specific in the layers of how you put your vision together
0wg18ytia28_5-5-rgb_front and then i wanted to have lots of fun things growing on the trees so i have is one of the amounts of many growing on one of my trees
0wg18ytia28_6-5-rgb_front well that makes me smile i think that would make anyone smile
0wg18ytia28_7-5-rgb_front and then you know adding go green and the little decorative that are going to add to it so that you have some depth in what it is you are creating
0wg18ytia28_8-5-rgb_front it is really really important when you put these vision boards together that you go deeper into who you are as a person that you really understand why is it that you want this
0wg18ytia28_9-5-rgb_front and for me if money is the root of generosity my having more money gives me the ability to do more for more people
0wl7gaojpu0_1-5-rgb_front and now think about how you can enrich your community by having a fabulous gallery
0wl7gaojpu0_2-5-rgb_front let me tell you how much people tell me they love what doing they really do and not only that bringing people from outside the community here sharing beauty in a public venue and people from anywhere
0wl7gaojpu0_3-5-rgb_front this guy came back yesterday from tokyo his second visit to varga from tokyo a big deal you want to reach out to the community you want them to love what doing you want them to feel like they want to come back you want them to send other people as well and when you make your community a better place by making your building beautiful by planting beautiful flowers by showing artwork outside everybody appreciates it
0wl7gaojpu0_4-5-rgb_front it enriches the area and it makes people happier to be here even if not happy in their regular lives be happier because in it and good and what a gallery should be
0wxwnnaohbm_0-5-rgb_front this type of neck is a turtleneck
0wxwnnaohbm_1-5-rgb_front what i have done is typically when we have a turtleneck we will see it folded down and smooth
0wxwnnaohbm_10-5-rgb_front and there is a turtleneck with it folded over
0wxwnnaohbm_2-5-rgb_front what i did here was i am representing it if you fold it all the way up
0wxwnnaohbm_3-5-rgb_front if you do not flip it over
0wxwnnaohbm_4-5-rgb_front you just have it standing up straight then it would have drape because obviously this distance from your shoulder to your chin is not going to be as long as the neck on the shirt the actual shirt so it is going to end up bunching because you are going to have it pulled up and your neck is going to push it down
0wxwnnaohbm_5-5-rgb_front so that is what i drew here
0wxwnnaohbm_6-5-rgb_front but if you have a regular turtleneck here i will show you how to draw it if it is folded over
0wxwnnaohbm_7-5-rgb_front obviously these are drape lines
0wxwnnaohbm_8-5-rgb_front so first do your little around the neck thing and then this is the fold line that is where it folds down over
0wxwnnaohbm_9-5-rgb_front and there is our neckline seam
0x-kl7mk6fc_1-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to go over the different types of bleeding that can occur and the different aspects of treating it
0x-kl7mk6fc_10-5-rgb_front the last type is our arterial bleed
0x-kl7mk6fc_11-5-rgb_front this one is very important because it is a major life threat and you could die from it very quickly
0x-kl7mk6fc_12-5-rgb_front arterial blood is the bleed is described as bright red squirting blood
0x-kl7mk6fc_13-5-rgb_front this will come in spirits with every time your heart beats
0x-kl7mk6fc_14-5-rgb_front it is important that when you come across an arterial bleed that you immediately go for the steps of treatment
0x-kl7mk6fc_15-5-rgb_front what that would include would be first direct pressure elevation pressure point and last is the tunicate
0x-kl7mk6fc_2-5-rgb_front there are three different types of bleeding that you should be aware of
0x-kl7mk6fc_3-5-rgb_front what they are is capillary venous and also arterial
0x-kl7mk6fc_4-5-rgb_front capillary bleeding is one of the most minor
0x-kl7mk6fc_5-5-rgb_front it usually requires no intervention at all
0x-kl7mk6fc_6-5-rgb_front that can be something such as a rug burn or what we call an abrasion where you have actually torn the skin off and you have what is an oozing type of blood coming out
0x-kl7mk6fc_7-5-rgb_front next is a venous type of blood
0x-kl7mk6fc_8-5-rgb_front venous blood will normally be dark and it is normally going to be a nice steady constant flow of blood
0x-kl7mk6fc_9-5-rgb_front that is what most people see and it is pretty common
0xagc82wq3o_0-5-rgb_front this hairstyle is good to use if you are drawing something that is evening wear something that you have a very simple and elegant evening gown a simple dress something that you do not want the hair to compete with in any way in any way shape or form
0xagc82wq3o_1-5-rgb_front nothing all that hard it is just a low bun at the nape of the neck hair is swooped over
0xagc82wq3o_2-5-rgb_front if you are designing a collection of work cloths this is always a good one to use
0xagc82wq3o_3-5-rgb_front you could even use this hairstyle on every single drawing that you do and just make it uniform throughout
0xagc82wq3o_4-5-rgb_front i have done that before and it ends up looking really good at the end because you have uniformity
0xagc82wq3o_5-5-rgb_front we start with our part and then decide where you want the bun to be as i said earlier nape of the neck low and then throw some in front of the face but still do it with order like it was intentional
0xagc82wq3o_6-5-rgb_front there you go
0xvo71gc-za_0-5-rgb_front alexson roy so our next related sports massage athletic condition is mostly what gymnasts and swimmers get and that is problems with their latissimus dorsi which is also known as big swim
0xvo71gc-za_1-5-rgb_front and then you have your teres minor as the little swim
0xvo71gc-za_10-5-rgb_front so once again everything is away from the spine
0xvo71gc-za_11-5-rgb_front spine is not really a joint the joints maybe within but this is not really a joint
0xvo71gc-za_12-5-rgb_front the thing is you will want to push it away from the actual spine cause this muscle right here along the spine is going to get really tight and then the latissimus dorsi gets really really tight because the spine is so tight
0xvo71gc-za_13-5-rgb_front so once again push it down push it out okay
0xvo71gc-za_14-5-rgb_front push down and then out
0xvo71gc-za_15-5-rgb_front push down and then out
0xvo71gc-za_16-5-rgb_front then maybe repeat that a couple of times until you feel it just gives a little bit
0xvo71gc-za_2-5-rgb_front and they call it big swim little swim because your latissimus dorsi is all of this right here all the way up to your scapula
0xvo71gc-za_3-5-rgb_front this whole entire muscle like of your lower back all the way up into your scapula okay
0xvo71gc-za_4-5-rgb_front it is at the bottom part okay
0xvo71gc-za_5-5-rgb_front and your teres minor connects right in here
0xvo71gc-za_6-5-rgb_front it is a little muscle that kinda attaches right through here okay
0xvo71gc-za_7-5-rgb_front so this is the big swim and then this is the little swim
0xvo71gc-za_8-5-rgb_front they have the same point of origin but different points of insertion but it is truly effective when you kinda do that front stroke okay
0xvo71gc-za_9-5-rgb_front or let is say you are a gymnast and you are hanging and you are trying to pull yourself up something like that
0xh74ﱚ1-5-rgb_front film festivals are a way to go
0xh74ﱚ10-5-rgb_front it is just depends
0xh74ﱚ11-5-rgb_front if you are a film festival type of person you are like going to festivals
0xh74ﱚ12-5-rgb_front you are like competing that way do it
0xh74ﱚ13-5-rgb_front it is always good to enter a couple of festivals if it is not your thing just do not do it anymore for future films
0xh74ﱚ14-5-rgb_front but my route usually is since i know where the program is going to go what my intention is it is kind of a waste of time for me to send it to a film festival because i rather just get it in the video stores
0xh74ﱚ15-5-rgb_front i would rather just get on pbs and wait the six months or whatever before i could send it out there because usually there is stipulation with the film festivals is you can not have your film distributed
0xh74ﱚ16-5-rgb_front you can not hand it out to distributors yet
0xh74ﱚ17-5-rgb_front it has to be kinda like an untouched product
0xh74ﱚ18-5-rgb_front so add time
0xh74ﱚ19-5-rgb_front if you have time you are in no rush you do the film festivals if you definitely want to get the thing out there get it sold
0xh74ﱚ2-5-rgb_front for some things i think film festivals worked a lot better years ago but they do not work so good now cause there is so many film festivals and a lot of them just seem ways i will not name any film festivals but they seen ways for the film festival to make money off the filmmakers cause there is so many filmmakers so many films being made
0xh74ﱚ20-5-rgb_front you are probably going to have to forego that route
0xh74ﱚ3-5-rgb_front they have like an entry fee or bucks or whatever and they are making a lot of money now hundreds or thousands of people send in their film with their or
0xh74ﱚ4-5-rgb_front so it is business for the film festival the companies who were doing the festivals
0xh74ﱚ5-5-rgb_front if you get accepted on festival or if it gets shown that is a way for the publicity that kinda works for the publicity and the hype
0xh74ﱚ6-5-rgb_front and if you win any award it is always good to say oh i won award
0xh74ﱚ7-5-rgb_front and that is again for the distributor he has all the newspaper articles or internet reviews or whatever it is as sure as the same purpose
0xh74ﱚ8-5-rgb_front just because you are accepted and let is say you win for a second or third prize at a film festival it does not mean you are going to get a distributor
0xh74ﱚ9-5-rgb_front it does not mean that distributors going to pay more money or whatever
0xkcq_pvkli_0-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to learn how to improve our math skills and do not fool yourself
0xkcq_pvkli_1-5-rgb_front just like i said in the other clip practice practice practice okay
0xkcq_pvkli_10-5-rgb_front ask your teacher for help
0xkcq_pvkli_11-5-rgb_front ask for help
0xkcq_pvkli_2-5-rgb_front the first thing you could do is practice every day for minutes especially if you do not have any homework
0xkcq_pvkli_3-5-rgb_front you must practice a little bit every day
0xkcq_pvkli_4-5-rgb_front i give my students homework and what i do is i give them twenty problems to do from one week to the next
0xkcq_pvkli_5-5-rgb_front maybe twenty five problems but i expect them to do only problems per day
0xkcq_pvkli_6-5-rgb_front that is three times seven is twenty one or three times eight is twenty four just three problems per day
0xkcq_pvkli_7-5-rgb_front that way they get used to the idea that they must practice the mathematics every single day whether they have homework or not
0xkcq_pvkli_8-5-rgb_front that is what makes the difference between the as and the cs okay
0xkcq_pvkli_9-5-rgb_front so also get together with one of your friends who knows their math really well and they could help you too
0xmdaovbnms_0-5-rgb_front i am going to tell you about a basic part of skateboarding which is the kick turn
0xmdaovbnms_1-5-rgb_front once you learned how to change your direction on the skateboard by leaning you can turn the skateboard by a kick turn
0xmdaovbnms_10-5-rgb_front anticipate the turn of your body feel it in your legs pressure on the back tail knees bent spin the rest of the body around degrees
0xmdaovbnms_11-5-rgb_front before long you will be using this trick to help you learn other tricks and it will help you learn how to keep your body with skateboard moving at all times
0xmdaovbnms_2-5-rgb_front a kick turn involves putting pressure on the back tail and spinning the board on the back wheels
0xmdaovbnms_3-5-rgb_front a kick turn can be any number of degrees or completely
0xmdaovbnms_4-5-rgb_front practicing these tricks will help you learn how to move with the skateboard and not against it
0xmdaovbnms_5-5-rgb_front simply stand on the skateboard move you back foot to the ollie position then as soon as you lift up the front of the skateboard begin to twist your body until you feel comfortable
0xmdaovbnms_6-5-rgb_front place the front wheels back down
0xmdaovbnms_7-5-rgb_front let is try a simple kick turn
0xmdaovbnms_8-5-rgb_front notice i begin to turn as soon as my back foot puts pressure on the tail one swift motion
0xmdaovbnms_9-5-rgb_front to turn sharper and faster you can make sure that your back foot is even further back on the tail and give your body more twist
0xpgr4qcpd0_1-5-rgb_front the great thing about aqua water fitness is you can basically do it anywhere there is a pool
0xpgr4qcpd0_2-5-rgb_front whether it is just a day out in the sun with the family or your own traveling around
0xpgr4qcpd0_3-5-rgb_front most hotels have pools where you can jump right in
0xpgr4qcpd0_4-5-rgb_front now most people have the idea that working on a pool you are not really getting a great fitness workout
0xpgr4qcpd0_5-5-rgb_front but that is totally wrong you can push yourself just as hard as you need to running on a treadmill working with weights no equipment needed to just hop in the pool
0xpgr4qcpd0_6-5-rgb_front the water creates a resistance so that you are working your shoulders all the way down to your toes depending on which muscle groups you are going to focus on in the pool
0xpgr4qcpd0_7-5-rgb_front it is so important to treat this just like you would any other workout
0xpgr4qcpd0_8-5-rgb_front warming up your muscles getting your heart rate up getting that blood flowing throughout all of the muscles
0xpgr4qcpd0_9-5-rgb_front so the first thing you want to do is to hop into the pool start running back and forth so that we can really get that cardio vascular system up and going
0xsng2yohma_0-5-rgb_front okay another form of artifactual communication is your clothing
0xsng2yohma_1-5-rgb_front what you wear gives a very strong impression of who you are
0xsng2yohma_10-5-rgb_front the only thing that you want to consider when it comes to clothing is are there certain times where you need to alter that expression
0xsng2yohma_11-5-rgb_front for example when i teach college class i always bring this up to my students
0xsng2yohma_12-5-rgb_front i tend to dress a little more conservatively
0xsng2yohma_13-5-rgb_front and i ask my students on the first day of class when i walked in the door what was your impression of me
0xsng2yohma_14-5-rgb_front and they rattle off all these complimentary things of course because they all want a is
0xsng2yohma_15-5-rgb_front but then i say to them what would you have thought if i had walked through the door in a tank top and cut off shorts
0xsng2yohma_16-5-rgb_front and they are all in shock because they would not quite know what to think of that
0xsng2yohma_17-5-rgb_front but it would give them an entirely different impression of me because i say to them what would you think of me as a professor if i did that
0xsng2yohma_18-5-rgb_front and the answers are always completely different than what the initial perception was because of the way i dress
0xsng2yohma_19-5-rgb_front so dress is a and it is just something to consider again based on whatever situations you might be going into
0xsng2yohma_2-5-rgb_front like me i like red sweaters
0xsng2yohma_3-5-rgb_front i wear my red sweater almost everyday
0xsng2yohma_4-5-rgb_front that is a big part of who i am
0xsng2yohma_5-5-rgb_front and everybody has a different style
0xsng2yohma_6-5-rgb_front you know maybe your style is more formal
0xsng2yohma_7-5-rgb_front maybe it is more casual
0xsng2yohma_8-5-rgb_front maybe you have a very bohemian style where you dress very eclectically
0xsng2yohma_9-5-rgb_front neither is good or bad it simply is a impression of who you are
0xxbsy0ek9i_0-5-rgb_front now that we have got one of our photos edited let is go ahead and edit the other background photo which is going to actually add to our scene here and that one is going to be this one here
0xxbsy0ek9i_1-5-rgb_front and actually what we can do is we can come over here and hit these little eyes here and turn off all of our other layers except the layer we are going to use
0xxbsy0ek9i_10-5-rgb_front and this tree looks kind of funky
0xxbsy0ek9i_11-5-rgb_front it looks like he is got some bananas in here and some grapes and stuff
0xxbsy0ek9i_12-5-rgb_front we do not want all this
0xxbsy0ek9i_13-5-rgb_front nor the background fence and the house and stuff
0xxbsy0ek9i_14-5-rgb_front but i do want the leaves and i want this branch here and i want this branch here just for background purposes
0xxbsy0ek9i_15-5-rgb_front i do not want this one
0xxbsy0ek9i_16-5-rgb_front so what we can do is we can actually come through here and we can quick mask what we are going to keep here
0xxbsy0ek9i_17-5-rgb_front this is another way of selecting the things that you want
0xxbsy0ek9i_18-5-rgb_front so come over here and what you are going to do your going to hit your quick mask button which is this button here with the square and the circle inside of it
0xxbsy0ek9i_19-5-rgb_front and then we are going to go into our brush tool because that is the only way our quick mask button will work
0xxbsy0ek9i_2-5-rgb_front let is go ahead and name this one
0xxbsy0ek9i_20-5-rgb_front let is bring our brush size down a little bit and what we are going to do is we are just going to come in here and we are just going to paint this selection here
0xxbsy0ek9i_21-5-rgb_front now this is going to take us a minute to do to do all this and to do all the leaves so i will go ahead and get in here and get this right
0xxbsy0ek9i_22-5-rgb_front let is go ahead and zoom in
0xxbsy0ek9i_23-5-rgb_front now i can release off of my tool and then come back to it and brush because what we are doing is really just painting
0xxbsy0ek9i_24-5-rgb_front now when you get to the edges if you want to you can actually use a soft paint brush if you want to select your edges here
0xxbsy0ek9i_25-5-rgb_front and what is going to happen is after we have selected what we want we can come in here and hit our quick mask tool and release it
0xxbsy0ek9i_26-5-rgb_front and as you can see everything that i have painted now becomes a selection
0xxbsy0ek9i_27-5-rgb_front but it is not really a selection
0xxbsy0ek9i_28-5-rgb_front what it is is an inverse selection
0xxbsy0ek9i_29-5-rgb_front you might not be able to see this here but i can see i have a bounding box all the way around the outside of my picture
0xxbsy0ek9i_3-5-rgb_front oops
0xxbsy0ek9i_30-5-rgb_front so what i want to do is hold down and then hit i which is going to inverse that selection and actually select everything in here
0xxbsy0ek9i_31-5-rgb_front and what i would do is i would delete everything outside of this selection
0xxbsy0ek9i_32-5-rgb_front or if i have my quick mask tool on i could just leave it on and use my erase tool and erase everything that is inside of this selection before i inverse it
0xxbsy0ek9i_33-5-rgb_front so this is how we are going to select this out continue on with it and i am going to pause here do what i need to do and we will come back in the next section
0xxbsy0ek9i_4-5-rgb_front let is not do that
0xxbsy0ek9i_5-5-rgb_front there we go
0xxbsy0ek9i_6-5-rgb_front let is name this apple branch and what we are going to do is let is pick our pick tool
0xxbsy0ek9i_7-5-rgb_front let is move this in the center here so i can see it
0xxbsy0ek9i_8-5-rgb_front hit bar to get our zoom tool option
0xxbsy0ek9i_9-5-rgb_front and as we can see here we have got a lot going on
0y4kvtkgnta_11-5-rgb_front so that if you do a dash line it means it is on the inside of the fabric
0y4kvtkgnta_12-5-rgb_front it is technically invisible
0y8f5elbpho_0-5-rgb_front o k the drink we are about to make is called a pink limon
0y8f5elbpho_1-5-rgb_front we are going to serve this up in a martini glass
0y8f5elbpho_10-5-rgb_front bottoms up
0y8f5elbpho_2-5-rgb_front so put some ice and water in there and let it sit while you are making your drink and it will be nice and cold
0y8f5elbpho_3-5-rgb_front alright we are going to measure out one and a half ounces of bacardi limon our lemon flavored rum
0y8f5elbpho_4-5-rgb_front and we are going to follow that up with two ounces of sour mix
0y8f5elbpho_5-5-rgb_front and next we will add a half ounce of cranberry juice
0y8f5elbpho_6-5-rgb_front let me add a little bit more than that make sure it gets nice and pink
0y8f5elbpho_7-5-rgb_front alright now we are going to shake it up get everything nice and cold
0y8f5elbpho_8-5-rgb_front go ahead and pour out your ice water and get your strainer pour it in very full
0y8f5elbpho_9-5-rgb_front and that is a pink limon
0yizzp0ugdw_0-8-rgb_front the next cast we are going to learn is the overhead cast
0yizzp0ugdw_1-8-rgb_front the overhead cast has two directions
0yizzp0ugdw_15-8-rgb_front notice how this is raised up
0yizzp0ugdw_16-8-rgb_front and then all we do is drop our elbow down
0yizzp0ugdw_17-8-rgb_front drop
0yizzp0ugdw_18-8-rgb_front and there is our completed overhead cast
0yizzp0ugdw_19-8-rgb_front now that you have learned the movements we are going to make the cast with the rod reel and line
0yizzp0ugdw_2-8-rgb_front it has a back direction and a forward direction
0yizzp0ugdw_20-8-rgb_front it is always best to start out with a short amount of line and learn to cast it well before you go for the gusto and the distance
0yizzp0ugdw_21-8-rgb_front so we are going to do just like we did with the roll cast
0yizzp0ugdw_22-8-rgb_front we are going to start with our tip down we are going to lift we are going to slide back like this
0yizzp0ugdw_23-8-rgb_front now notice how we flick out rod tip up
0yizzp0ugdw_24-8-rgb_front flick up there and there is our cast
0yizzp0ugdw_25-8-rgb_front so as you have noticed as i brought this rod up my head actually followed my hand and i went up to my rod tip to see the line and i came forward
0yizzp0ugdw_26-8-rgb_front when you are learning this it is really crucial that you watch the timing of the rod and the line as it works
0yizzp0ugdw_3-8-rgb_front the back direction is the hardest to learn because it is really difficult for us to essentially learn to make our muscles cast backwards and then go forward
0yizzp0ugdw_4-8-rgb_front so the overhead cast is used when you have lots of room behind you to make a forward cast and a back cast and you are not limited with back cast room like we did with the roll cast
0ylgmh8isqa_1-5-rgb_front now i can pretty much guarantee you if you have been chosen to be a best man or a maid of honor you are going to be giving a wedding toast
0ylgmh8isqa_2-5-rgb_front but you might not necessarily be in one of those positions but you still might have been asked to give a wedding toast
0ylgmh8isqa_3-5-rgb_front do not panic do not freak out it is really not difficult
0ylgmh8isqa_4-5-rgb_front i am going to show you step by step the way in which you want to write this speech and then i am going to give you some really important information about what to do and what not to do especially in relation to delivering the speech
0ylgmh8isqa_5-5-rgb_front a wedding speech is really important not so much for you but for the bride and groom especially the bride because i guarantee you the words that you say she and maybe he will remember for the rest of their lives
0ylgmh8isqa_6-5-rgb_front but it does not have to be a freak out
0ylgmh8isqa_7-5-rgb_front it is super simple
0ylgmh8isqa_8-5-rgb_front come on i will show you
0ybfw9vfaz4_0-5-rgb_front i have done a rough sketch with the pen
0ybfw9vfaz4_1-5-rgb_front i am now going to work over that with black acrylic paint
0ybfw9vfaz4_12-5-rgb_front i understand that i just do not do it
0ybfw9vfaz4_13-5-rgb_front i paint the way i feel intuitively that i should go
0ybfw9vfaz4_14-5-rgb_front so in this section i want to do the tiger first
0ybfw9vfaz4_15-5-rgb_front yes when i start painting behind i may overlap onto the black but that is okay then i will paint the black again
0ybfw9vfaz4_16-5-rgb_front it is my particular method and i said earlier i have a tendency to paint in strange ways i do not follow the norm
0ybfw9vfaz4_17-5-rgb_front but this is the way i do it
0ybfw9vfaz4_18-5-rgb_front and i think my point here is that i celebrate my way
0ybfw9vfaz4_19-5-rgb_front so anybody else is way i also celebrate as long as they do not try to tell me to do it there way
0ybfw9vfaz4_2-5-rgb_front most of the paint i have used for the walls and the murals is actually just a standard interior eggshell which i got from the paint store
0ybfw9vfaz4_20-5-rgb_front i am not trying to tell anybody to do it my way i am just showing you what i do
0ybfw9vfaz4_3-5-rgb_front as you know you can get any color mixed up that you like so i had a variety of colors that i worked with
0ybfw9vfaz4_4-5-rgb_front when i want to go into details then i use my acrylic paints for the bright red flowers and the blues and the black on the tiger
0yekult9lnu_0-5-rgb_front hi i am chris murray and i am going to show you how to warm up using touch drills
0yekult9lnu_1-5-rgb_front in soccer it is very important for you to warm up with and without the ball
0yekult9lnu_10-5-rgb_front this is another way to really get your legs warm for a soccer game
0yekult9lnu_11-5-rgb_front another touch drill to do before a soccer game is just simple dribbling
0yekult9lnu_12-5-rgb_front by dribbling around in a large area or even in a small area really allows you to get a feel for the ball
0yekult9lnu_13-5-rgb_front and those are just some touch drills to do when you warm up for soccer
0yekult9lnu_2-5-rgb_front by warming up without the ball allows you to get your muscles warm enough and be able to stretch
0yekult9lnu_3-5-rgb_front by warming up with the ball really gets you a feel for the ball and gets you ready to play
0yekult9lnu_4-5-rgb_front some little touch drills that you can do to warm up are extremely simple
0yekult9lnu_5-5-rgb_front one touch drill that you can do to warm up is just boxes on the ball
0yekult9lnu_6-5-rgb_front boxes on the ball are done by having the ball in between your feet and touching the ball back and forth
0yekult9lnu_7-5-rgb_front this really allows for you to get your legs warm and for you to get a feel for the ball
0yekult9lnu_8-5-rgb_front another touch drill that you can do to warm up for soccer is touches on top of the ball
0yekult9lnu_9-5-rgb_front touches on top of the ball are done by just jogging in place touching the top of the ball with the soles of your feet
0yiq9ntt6ek_0_1_2_3-5-rgb_front hello this is j b i am with austin homebrew supply here in beautiful austin texas today we are talking a little bit about wine making equipment
0yiq9ntt6ek_10-5-rgb_front so by using one of these refractometers you are able to figure out the sugar content of whatever liquid you are trying to you are trying test the sugar content of
0yiq9ntt6ek_11-5-rgb_front so that is just a little bit about how to use a refractometer
0yiq9ntt6ek_4-5-rgb_front now right now i want to talk about a particular testing instrument called a refractometer
0yiq9ntt6ek_5-5-rgb_front a refractometer is one other way one other testing instrument that you could use to figure out the sugar content in a liquid
0yiq9ntt6ek_6-5-rgb_front so with the refractometer what you would do you would take the refractometer and you would take the pipette that is also part of the refractometer kit and let is say you are out in a vineyard and you want to test the sugar content of a grape
0yiq9ntt6ek_7-5-rgb_front you would simply take one of the grapes off the vine break it use your pipette to draw a sample out of it and then open the cover on the refractometer take your pipette put a couple of drops on it on the face plate here and then drop that cover back down
0yiq9ntt6ek_8-5-rgb_front then you would simply take this guy hold it into the sunlight and look into the end of it
0yiq9ntt6ek_9-5-rgb_front there would be a scale that will be generated by this face plate that when you read it from the inside there will be a line at the particular sugar content that this particular grape has
0ymokvcaqt4_0-5-rgb_front here is another couple of examples of what the holga does and does fairly well
0ymokvcaqt4_1-5-rgb_front this is an image taken with the holga with a flash very cloudy day
0ymokvcaqt4_10-5-rgb_front so again the subject is just right in front and then the background the people there it just is completely flattened out almost like that is a painting or a backdrop behind her or him
0ymokvcaqt4_2-5-rgb_front this is actually one of the original munchkins from the wizard of oz
0ymokvcaqt4_3-5-rgb_front and the holga tends to make strange situations or strange images even stranger
0ymokvcaqt4_4-5-rgb_front and that is sort of what i feel it did in this image
0ymokvcaqt4_5-5-rgb_front it just really looks really the flash hit her and just really made a very interesting image
0ymokvcaqt4_6-5-rgb_front and also this image the holga tends to do something to backgrounds where it flattens them out and that has a lot to do with the aperture that is in the holga
0ymokvcaqt4_7-5-rgb_front but it also it just makes things look like a movie still which i find it does again and again and again
0ymokvcaqt4_8-5-rgb_front and it is sort of back to that holga being a pony sort of thing
0ymokvcaqt4_9-5-rgb_front and it actually you know if you utilize it properly it is an absolutely amazing tool
0yuqhcagsbs_0-5-rgb_front o k
0yuqhcagsbs_1-5-rgb_front what we are doing as we have our piece of paper in front of us and we are going down that outline and we are writing our thoughts is we are trying to look for holes in the other person is case or theory if you will
0yuqhcagsbs_10-5-rgb_front we are going to make an analysis of those and then we are also going to need to take a look at their evidence
0yuqhcagsbs_11-5-rgb_front and their evidence are the things that they have found in research that prove these arguments to be true or support these arguments
0yuqhcagsbs_12-5-rgb_front so those are the two things that we are going to take a look at to try to refute the persuasive claim
0yuqhcagsbs_13-5-rgb_front let is look at evidence first
0yuqhcagsbs_2-5-rgb_front where are the mistakes that they made in their presentation
0yuqhcagsbs_3-5-rgb_front so we are going to do an analysis of their evidence and their arguments
0yuqhcagsbs_4_5-5-rgb_front and of course what their arguments are are things like well it s cruel to take animals to the slaughter house that would be an argument
0yuqhcagsbs_6_7_8_9-5-rgb_front abortion is wrong ten year track appointments for professors are a good thing or a bad thing whatever it is what are their arguments
0z-gcdc8oow_1-8-rgb_front in the following clips we are going to talk about the correct procedure for replacing your upper and lower ball joints on a drive full size vehicle
0z-gcdc8oow_10-8-rgb_front right here just a chunk of pipe
0z-gcdc8oow_11-8-rgb_front i am going to slip on the handle
0z-gcdc8oow_12-8-rgb_front what that is going to give me is the mechanical advantage over this stubby handle
0z-gcdc8oow_13-8-rgb_front just due to the style of vehicle you may be working on you may have to do some pressing and change your cup configuration
0z-gcdc8oow_14-8-rgb_front i will go over that with you here shortly
0z-gcdc8oow_15-8-rgb_front what we are going to do is run the ball joint down until it is tight
0z-gcdc8oow_16-8-rgb_front when it is tight i am going to release my drive screw and check and see if i can actually get my snap ring on the ball joint itself
0z-gcdc8oow_17-8-rgb_front there we are good and tight
0z-gcdc8oow_18-8-rgb_front you break it loose
0z-gcdc8oow_19-8-rgb_front as you can see my ball joint in not pressed entirely through the hole we re going to have to change our configuration slightly to continue squeezing the ball joint into the location it is going to need to be in
0z-gcdc8oow_2-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about the actual procedure used for pressing in your new ball joint
0z-gcdc8oow_20-8-rgb_front as you can see i changed my ball joint driving configuration slightly
0z-gcdc8oow_21-8-rgb_front what i did was take my cup from the bottom and moved it to the top
0z-gcdc8oow_22-8-rgb_front depending on how much room you have when you are pressing in your new ball joint you may have to switch it back and forth
0z-gcdc8oow_23-8-rgb_front these clamps come in various different sizes
0z-gcdc8oow_24-8-rgb_front the particular one we had only had enough throw to get it started and then we would have to switch it and drive it through
0z-gcdc8oow_25-8-rgb_front the larger one are of course more expensive and your parts store may not carry it
0z-gcdc8oow_26-8-rgb_front the kits are designed to be extremely universal so if you put the kit together correctly you can do any ball joint on the market
0z-gcdc8oow_27-8-rgb_front i have got my configuration changed
0z-gcdc8oow_28-8-rgb_front i am going to take my ratchet and put it back on the drive screw my cheater pipe and finish pressing my ball joint in place
0z-gcdc8oow_29-8-rgb_front all right
0z-gcdc8oow_3-8-rgb_front i have my drive ratchet with a socket
0z-gcdc8oow_30-8-rgb_front and that is proper way to seat your ball joint
0z-gcdc8oow_31-8-rgb_front what i am going to do is loosen up my clamp and get it out of the way
0z-gcdc8oow_32-8-rgb_front as you can see my ball joint is pushed all the way through
0z-gcdc8oow_33-8-rgb_front you can actually take and look and see the groove that our snap ring seats in
0z-gcdc8oow_34-8-rgb_front you can take and feel it underneath at shoulder and make sure that there is no gap
0z-gcdc8oow_35-8-rgb_front we do not have one
0z-gcdc8oow_36-8-rgb_front that is the proper way to press in your new ball joint
0z-gcdc8oow_4-8-rgb_front the ball joint press itself has a hex head on it which where you are going to put your socket at
0z-gcdc8oow_5-8-rgb_front it is either a or a
0z-gcdc8oow_6-8-rgb_front those are the only one is that they have on the market
0z-gcdc8oow_7-8-rgb_front i am going to take my socket and stick it on there and tighten the screw down
0z-gcdc8oow_8-8-rgb_front you may need to use a cheater pipe
0z-gcdc8oow_9-8-rgb_front i have one here handy
0z19llirtv4_1-5-rgb_front when sanding our pieces we just want to start by sanding the outside of our frame
0z19llirtv4_2-5-rgb_front you can flip it over and get that inside part
0z19llirtv4_3-5-rgb_front the next thing that we need to do is break the edges and what i mean by breaking edges is take some sand paper along each edges that is going to be showing
0z19llirtv4_4-5-rgb_front or someone could potentially touch it and we are just going to sand lightly and just round over those edges just a tinnie tiny bit
0z19llirtv4_5-5-rgb_front now the reason that we do this is so if somebody bumps into it once it is finished it does not chip off a chunk of the finish and make it look bad
0z19llirtv4_6-5-rgb_front by breaking these edges is would really help prevent that
0zd5uh7s35a_0-5-rgb_front so what i am holding in my hand is a millimeter negative carrier
0zd5uh7s35a_1-5-rgb_front and what you do with this is you put your negative in here and you close it
0zd5uh7s35a_10-5-rgb_front i like doing it on a light table
0zd5uh7s35a_11-5-rgb_front when i talk about printing i am going to show how to do it on the light table
0zd5uh7s35a_12-5-rgb_front but for today i just want to show you how this enlarger works
0zd5uh7s35a_13-5-rgb_front the notches me
0zd5uh7s35a_14-5-rgb_front i pull the head open and what i do is i slide it in and i make sure it fits perfectly
0zd5uh7s35a_15-5-rgb_front thus the light can shine through my negative onto my photographic paper and i am on my way to making a print
0zd5uh7s35a_2-5-rgb_front put this top part back on
0zd5uh7s35a_3-5-rgb_front now there are a million designs of these type of carriers but what i am showing you today is a design for this one
0zd5uh7s35a_4-5-rgb_front this is pretty common actually
0zd5uh7s35a_5-5-rgb_front the thing you want to remember is to make sure that all the pieces fit
0zd5uh7s35a_6-5-rgb_front this notch should meet with this notch
0zd5uh7s35a_7-5-rgb_front what you do not want to do is have something that looks kind of wrong
0zd5uh7s35a_8-5-rgb_front like the notches are not fitting correctly
0zd5uh7s35a_9-5-rgb_front when you are putting your negative in here you really want to take your time
0zg5l_e5sku_1-5-rgb_front so what are loops those are those things that you do on letters like h on y and g and we are going to look at the size and shape of the loop
0zg5l_e5sku_2-5-rgb_front so when we are talking about loops we are talking about letters such as h where you see there is an upper loop or g where there is a lower loop
0zg5l_e5sku_3-5-rgb_front ok now that would be what i would call an average size of loop
0zg5l_e5sku_4-5-rgb_front now if you have a loop which is very rounded that might be like that like that you see how rounded it is and that means a person who is very open to other people is ideas what we call in hypnosis suggestible
0zg5l_e5sku_5-5-rgb_front alright or you can have a loop which is not at all rounded or in fact missing even it might be like that or like that and that is a person who is a lot less suggestible less open to other people is ideas tends to have their own opinion on things they tend to be more analytical a bit more critical
0zg5l_e5sku_6-5-rgb_front another type of loop is a loop which is actually pointed at the top if i can do that or at the bottom pointed now i did not do that very well but you can try and see what i mean there anytime you have this point here that indicates a level of neurosis that is kind of like over thinking things
0zg5l_e5sku_7-5-rgb_front ok the other thing to look at with loops is are we having an emphasis on the left hand side or the right hand side see what i mean of the letter so anything which is on the left hand side indicates the past and on the right hand side indicates the future
0zg5l_e5sku_8-5-rgb_front so this person here if they had a loop like that you might say they are very they tend to look back at the past a lot and could be someone who is a little nostalgic some one like that and this would be someone who is a bit more forward thinking and they like to think about things in the future
0za4bypd9y8_0-5-rgb_front one of the things that you really do not want on a job for when you are working from a home office environment is distractions
0za4bypd9y8_1-5-rgb_front it is so and this is actually true whether you work from home or any typical office setting
0za4bypd9y8_10-5-rgb_front what you want to do is completely avoid and if you can until you are completely done with your most important things for that day that you need to get done
0za4bypd9y8_11-5-rgb_front and if that is not possible then at least schedule in times maybe once or twice a day when you will attend and but do not go over that time
0za4bypd9y8_12-5-rgb_front and anything you can not get done it probably was not the most important thing anyway so you will be okay
0za4bypd9y8_2-5-rgb_front but as far as and voice mails go those are kind of your big time consumers if you let them be
0za4bypd9y8_3-5-rgb_front i know for my self and i have talked to a lot of other people who work at home who have found that who has somewhat challenge when you are constantly checking your there is always something coming up that you can do
0za4bypd9y8_4-5-rgb_front and a lot of times it is not the most important thing but you get sucked into it and before you know it an hour is gone
0za4bypd9y8_5-5-rgb_front so here i go to my oh lets see okay yeah this guy he wants me to write an article for him this is important i better get back to him
0za4bypd9y8_6-5-rgb_front oh okay he wants to know oh what do i do okay i got to get and see my resume some writing samples
0za4bypd9y8_7-5-rgb_front you know what there is an effective way to do things and an ineffective
0za4bypd9y8_8-5-rgb_front the ineffective way is to just attack everything as soon as it comes
0za4bypd9y8_9-5-rgb_front that is not effective because you will if you do that you can easily use up eight hours in a day responding to and and you are not going to get anything done
0zkdvbrsm-u_0-5-rgb_front it is important to talk a little bit more about main springs and the rise of main springs because it really allowed the american clock and just redo blast them in a way that it could have if they were confined to making big cases that had to have weight descending inside them
0zkdvbrsm-u_1-5-rgb_front you really suddenly with main springs powering the clock you could make much smaller clock you could make clocks that were inexpensive as well and it could fit in people is homes in a different way
0zkdvbrsm-u_10-5-rgb_front this is a from a french clock but instead of the spring being out in the air and expanding the spring is contained within a barrel
0zkdvbrsm-u_11-5-rgb_front this system works basically the same but it keeps the spring cleaner and allows you to have have the spring gear driving in and perhaps a little bit more effective weight then these open springs even though you have the expense and complexity of building a main spring barrel
0zkdvbrsm-u_2-5-rgb_front this is just an example of a ansonia ironing clock but spring driven
0zkdvbrsm-u_3-5-rgb_front if this clock had weights in it it have to be the size of the og clocks or the pillars and scroll clocks that we talked about before
0zkdvbrsm-u_4-5-rgb_front i have got a couple of main springs here to look at and these are steel
0zkdvbrsm-u_5-5-rgb_front i mentioned that brass main springs were used initially by terry and andrews and some others but they were they were not as good for a number of reasons
0zkdvbrsm-u_6-5-rgb_front so these are steel main springs often when a main spring breaks that is what the problem is and we will talk about servicing clocks later but this is what is powering the clock it is your energy that winds it up tight
0zkdvbrsm-u_7-5-rgb_front most of these clocks have open springs
0zkdvbrsm-u_8-5-rgb_front well if you look in the back at the movement or if we look in my the movement on the stand we saw before you can actually see the main spring that expands as it is running and gets small and gets nice and tight and small when you have wound it up
0zkdvbrsm-u_9-5-rgb_front many clocks however contains the main spring inside of barrels
0zzqqetjdi8_0-5-rgb_front this exercise is for spinal extension
0zzqqetjdi8_1-5-rgb_front working the muscles in the back
0zzqqetjdi8_10-5-rgb_front closing the ribcage to protect your back
0zzqqetjdi8_11-5-rgb_front inhale
0zzqqetjdi8_12-5-rgb_front come forward to stretch out the back
0zzqqetjdi8_13-5-rgb_front exhale
0zzqqetjdi8_14-5-rgb_front come back
0zzqqetjdi8_15-5-rgb_front closing the ribcage
0zzqqetjdi8_16-5-rgb_front inhale
0zzqqetjdi8_17-5-rgb_front forward
0zzqqetjdi8_18-5-rgb_front exhale
0zzqqetjdi8_19-5-rgb_front back
0zzqqetjdi8_2-5-rgb_front go ahead and center your ball in front of your body and lean into the ball
0zzqqetjdi8_20-5-rgb_front and inhale
0zzqqetjdi8_21-5-rgb_front forward
0zzqqetjdi8_22-5-rgb_front and when you are done go ahead and stretch over the ball
0zzqqetjdi8_23-5-rgb_front hug it
0zzqqetjdi8_24-5-rgb_front separating the scapula to release those muscles in your back
0zzqqetjdi8_3-5-rgb_front so the ball should be just up above your pelvis
0zzqqetjdi8_4-5-rgb_front digging your hipbones into the ball
0zzqqetjdi8_5-5-rgb_front bring your hands to the back of your head
0zzqqetjdi8_6-5-rgb_front or if you want you can bring your hands out here
0zzqqetjdi8_7-5-rgb_front gently touching the back of your head
0zzqqetjdi8_8-5-rgb_front head is in line with the spine
0zzqqetjdi8_9-5-rgb_front take a nice inhale and exhale come back
1--hxyoh4kg_0-5-rgb_front another very important part of our weight management program is understanding energy sources
1--hxyoh4kg_1-5-rgb_front the body has two sources of the energy that it needs
1--hxyoh4kg_10-5-rgb_front what this product does is it tricks your body into thinking that the glycogen has been depleted so the body will start burning fat immediately
1--hxyoh4kg_11-5-rgb_front the way this works is like this you consume an access bar minutes before activity on an empty stomach and your body will immediately start burning fat
1--hxyoh4kg_12-5-rgb_front there are several benefits to this
1--hxyoh4kg_13-5-rgb_front one you do not get lactic acid buildup which is what happens when the body is burning sugar
1--hxyoh4kg_14-5-rgb_front there is also no fatigue which also happens when the body is burning sugar
1--hxyoh4kg_15-5-rgb_front and the third benefit is no muscle soreness which is one of the greatest inhibitors to the continuity in an exercise program because if you are sore the next day you are not likely to get up and go at it again
1--hxyoh4kg_16-5-rgb_front the important thing is to be able to enjoy the exercise and utilizing the access bar and applying this whole concept of the energy system is what enables us to really be able to enjoy the activity so we look forward to it to the next day
1--hxyoh4kg_2-5-rgb_front it can either burn fat or it can burn sugar
1--hxyoh4kg_3-5-rgb_front naturally we are all trying to burn fat because we are trying to streamline our bodies and we are trying to lose weight
1--hxyoh4kg_4-5-rgb_front but the problem there is that the body is programmed to protect its fat source
1--hxyoh4kg_5-5-rgb_front so basically it has to deplete the glycogen which is the sugar storage in the blood before it will even begin to burn fat
1--hxyoh4kg_6-5-rgb_front this means that normally in our exercise program we have to exercise for at least minutes to be able to work through the glycogen in the blood and that is when we begin to burn fat
1--hxyoh4kg_7-5-rgb_front there is a solution to this problem though
1--hxyoh4kg_8-5-rgb_front there is a product called the access bar
1--hxyoh4kg_9-5-rgb_front it is made from a special kind of chocolate
1-2utifxwao_0-5-rgb_front okay so this is the second leg that we did and this is the one that we cut off it has the seam binding on it or hem tape whatever you want to call it
1-2utifxwao_1-5-rgb_front and this is just a little review of what we did on the other leg basically
1-2utifxwao_10-5-rgb_front and i am just going to grab the pants the lower layer and the fold all at once and i am actually going to make several tacks just to go through this because i do not want that to come apart
1-2utifxwao_11-5-rgb_front i do not think it is going to i did like so
1-2utifxwao_12-5-rgb_front and i showed you how to do a whip stitch earlier so let is just review
1-2utifxwao_13-5-rgb_front you grab a little piece go right through the side of the binding and it is basically just like it says a whip stitch it is a blind stitch
1-2utifxwao_14-5-rgb_front when you flip it over you can not see it on the other side
1-2utifxwao_15-5-rgb_front there we go
1-2utifxwao_16-5-rgb_front and we are almost finished with this
1-2utifxwao_2-5-rgb_front we are going to pin this up right where we want it
1-2utifxwao_3-5-rgb_front and on the other leg let is see on this one
1-2utifxwao_4-5-rgb_front actually i had used the gray thread and now that i am pinning this up looking at it i think i might just use some black thread that will match my hem tape and it will make it look really nice and professional just in case somebody wants to look inside of your pant leg and see how it is done
1-2utifxwao_5-5-rgb_front okay so let me get my needle out and enough thread to go around the leg
1-2utifxwao_6-5-rgb_front and i like to use a really sharp needle on blue jeans just because if you use a dull one it is going to be really hard to grab those little pieces
1-2utifxwao_7-5-rgb_front okay so i am going to start right here where these have overlaps and i am going to i am just going to move that thing out of the way
1-2utifxwao_8-5-rgb_front this is one of the few things that you kind of need to know about steam binding
1-2utifxwao_9-5-rgb_front there we go
1-9kdwon_r0_0-5-rgb_front hello my name is scott
1-9kdwon_r0_1-5-rgb_front and i am the owner of climb on indoor rock climbing in wilmington north carolina
1-9kdwon_r0_10-5-rgb_front these are the benefits of indoor rock climbing gyms
1-9kdwon_r0_11-5-rgb_front thank you
1-9kdwon_r0_2-5-rgb_front today we are going to discuss the benefits of indoor rock climbing
1-9kdwon_r0_3-5-rgb_front some of the benefits of indoor rock climbing are that you have a controlled environment to learn the skills that it takes to become a good rock climber
1-9kdwon_r0_4-5-rgb_front different skill levels are needed outside when you go climbing
1-9kdwon_r0_5-5-rgb_front in an indoor climbing situation you can use many different types of faces cracks to begin the learning process of climbing
1-9kdwon_r0_6-5-rgb_front the controlled environment is a very safe place to work your skills keep them updated or learn new skills
1-9kdwon_r0_7-5-rgb_front again in a safe controlled environment of an indoor rock climbing gym
1-9kdwon_r0_8-5-rgb_front some of these skills may include knots how to belay somebody sport climbing trad climbing or setting up a top rope in an anchor class
1-9kdwon_r0_9-5-rgb_front with these skills you are going to become a better climber outdoors safer and more knowledgeable
1-qn6nnxlmg_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to talk about advanced encaustic painting
1-qn6nnxlmg_10-5-rgb_front so once you get some of these down you can then switch points again and use the brush
1-qn6nnxlmg_11-5-rgb_front now i do not use that brush like you use a paintbrush but i kind of just pull it through the wax
1-qn6nnxlmg_12-5-rgb_front in a case like this i could just come up and touch some of those lines like that and draw up some of that wax it look a little bit more treelike here
1-qn6nnxlmg_13-5-rgb_front and i think if you start experimenting with these different points for doing details on trees and foliage you will find that they work really good in combination
1-qn6nnxlmg_2-5-rgb_front so this was the very first painting that i tried to paint larger than just a card size a couple of years ago
1-qn6nnxlmg_3-5-rgb_front and i thought i would just point out things like trees
1-qn6nnxlmg_4-5-rgb_front they are really not that complicated but again we are going to use the stylus
1-qn6nnxlmg_5-5-rgb_front you can use different pen points
1-qn6nnxlmg_6-5-rgb_front for instance you could use the trunk with this pen point to get a trunk going
1-qn6nnxlmg_7-5-rgb_front you could then switch to a more finer point like this to do some of the limbs of the tree
1-qn6nnxlmg_8-5-rgb_front let is just start drawing it this way
1-qn6nnxlmg_9-5-rgb_front now i could use this thicker point just as well but i thought i would just do a couple of these strokes down here just to show you what you can do after you put this down
1-ud-q4y1oc_0-5-rgb_front now we are going to clean the windows
1-ud-q4y1oc_1-5-rgb_front now obviously if you are up on the second floor like this you can not do the outside of the windows yourself so i am just going to do the inside because that is all i can do from here
1-ud-q4y1oc_2-5-rgb_front so we are just going to use a glass cleaner anyone that you like and again i go from bottom to top any time i use any time i am cleaning mirrors or windows so that it does not soak into the bottom
1-ud-q4y1oc_3-5-rgb_front so again you need to make sure that you put a bit of elbow grease into this
1-ud-q4y1oc_4-5-rgb_front it depends on how often you clean your widows but really give it a good wipe down
1-ud-q4y1oc_5-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that your windows are sparkling and you get quite a bit splash here from the bath tub if you have got kids in the tub or if you have got windows nearby and also sometimes just the condensation from the shower can also leave little water marks on your windows
1-ud-q4y1oc_6-5-rgb_front so just give it a good rub up and down and give it maybe two or three squirts and your windows are nice and clean
1-vx310yqtw_0-1-rgb_front hi
1-vx310yqtw_10-1-rgb_front this one does not so just pretend with me
1-vx310yqtw_11-1-rgb_front when you are going to hit the ball most times it is going to be right in the center
1-vx310yqtw_12-1-rgb_front you will know that you have hit it in the center if it comes back to you the same way that you aimed it
1-vx310yqtw_13-1-rgb_front not bad
1-vx310yqtw_14-1-rgb_front that is hitting it in the center
1-vx310yqtw_15-1-rgb_front sometimes you have got to use english for different reasons
1-vx310yqtw_16-1-rgb_front english is when you hit the ball anywhere but in the center
1-vx310yqtw_17-1-rgb_front there is low english there is high english there is left english there is right english and there is any combination of those
1-vx310yqtw_18-1-rgb_front let me give you a little example of what each one of them does
1-vx310yqtw_19-1-rgb_front let me grab one of these
1-vx310yqtw_2-1-rgb_front okay you have got you stick you know how to hold it and now you have picked out your bridge
1-vx310yqtw_20-1-rgb_front this is mr one ball he is the yellow one
1-vx310yqtw_21-1-rgb_front first i want to show you low english
1-vx310yqtw_22-1-rgb_front low english is going to draw the ball back
1-vx310yqtw_23-1-rgb_front so when i hit it i use low english aiming low at center and the ball is going to come back to me or it is going to stop
1-vx310yqtw_24-1-rgb_front let me try that again
1-vx310yqtw_25-1-rgb_front that is low english
1-vx310yqtw_26-1-rgb_front now what i did before on accident it is kind of called stop which it does not really have quite a name
1-vx310yqtw_27-1-rgb_front it is not quite low and its not quite center
1-vx310yqtw_28-1-rgb_front when you hit the ball this way the ball is going to stop
1-vx310yqtw_29-1-rgb_front that is important when you are lining up your next shot and it is somewhere close
1-vx310yqtw_3-1-rgb_front finally let is hit the cue ball
1-vx310yqtw_30-1-rgb_front now the opposite of low english is high english and it does the exact opposite
1-vx310yqtw_31-1-rgb_front this time when i hit the ball i am going to use high english which is above center and the ball is going to follow
1-vx310yqtw_32-1-rgb_front that is when i am going to chase the ball to another shot
1-vx310yqtw_33-1-rgb_front now similarly there is left and there is right english and that does the same thing
1-vx310yqtw_34-1-rgb_front left english the ball is going to go to the left and right english the ball is going to the right
1-vx310yqtw_35-1-rgb_front i will explain later why these are important but for right now that is english
1-vx310yqtw_36-1-rgb_front one more thing
1-vx310yqtw_37-1-rgb_front when you are shooting the cue ball always make sure you keep your form all the way through
1-vx310yqtw_38-1-rgb_front it is kind of like golf
1-vx310yqtw_39-1-rgb_front you do not want to shoot and raise up and see what happens
1-vx310yqtw_4-1-rgb_front by the way this is the cue ball
1-vx310yqtw_40-1-rgb_front that is not good
1-vx310yqtw_41-1-rgb_front if it will help you think about striking and imaginary ball that is right in front of that ball
1-vx310yqtw_42-1-rgb_front that means that really i am pretending that i am shooting right here
1-vx310yqtw_43-1-rgb_front what that does is it forces me to shoot through the ball
1-vx310yqtw_44-1-rgb_front after i shoot i am keeping my head down and keeping my body down that way i am not affecting by making any sudden movements
1-vx310yqtw_45-1-rgb_front again when you shoot shoot through the ball
1-vx310yqtw_5-1-rgb_front it is the white one
1-vx310yqtw_6-1-rgb_front i will talk about the rest of the balls in a second but right now this is how you hit it
1-vx310yqtw_7-1-rgb_front now there are many different ways to hit the cue ball
1-vx310yqtw_8-1-rgb_front the most direct is right in the center
1-vx310yqtw_9-1-rgb_front now many balls will have a little dot on them for reference
1-y7zncfsns_0-5-rgb_front what i am going to talk about now is spotting your print
1-y7zncfsns_1-5-rgb_front now spotting your print is when you have a print that you have made and there are pieces of dust or hair that you do not want people to see in your print
1-y7zncfsns_10-5-rgb_front you always want to make sure you have something of a decent brush and it really should not it really a double zero or a triple zero is the absolute best kind of brush to use
1-y7zncfsns_2-5-rgb_front now in the best world you were able to get off the dust and hair with your negative cleaner or with your cloth but as we all know things happen sometimes there is even dust in the enlarger sometimes there is dust on the paper when you took it out of the box who knows
1-y7zncfsns_3-5-rgb_front but regardless there is usually a little bit of spots in everybody is print and there is a couple of different ways that you can make it so they are not so noticeable
1-y7zncfsns_4-5-rgb_front this way is called spotting and what this is is it is a name called and i have a brush
1-y7zncfsns_5-5-rgb_front i am going to talk about now is the brush
1-y7zncfsns_6-5-rgb_front this is a double zero delta
1-y7zncfsns_7-5-rgb_front i will either use a double zero or a triple zero sable brush
1-y7zncfsns_8-5-rgb_front these brushes can range from seven dollars upwards to thirty or forty dollars
1-y7zncfsns_9-5-rgb_front in some ways the more expensive brush you have the easier it is to spot
1-iy8qmp4l0_0-5-rgb_front i am going to show you how make a drink called a detroit daisy
1-iy8qmp4l0_1-5-rgb_front we are going to start off with our ice
1-iy8qmp4l0_10-5-rgb_front your going to pour this into a rocks glass
1-iy8qmp4l0_11-5-rgb_front just like so
1-iy8qmp4l0_12-5-rgb_front last but not least
1-iy8qmp4l0_13-5-rgb_front we are going to pour in just a little splash of grenadine
1-iy8qmp4l0_14-5-rgb_front that is going to sink to the bottom
1-iy8qmp4l0_15-5-rgb_front so you are going to take your stirry straw and give it a stir
1-iy8qmp4l0_16-5-rgb_front it is going to be nice and pretty
1-iy8qmp4l0_17-5-rgb_front you can garnish this with a maraschino cherry
1-iy8qmp4l0_18-5-rgb_front just drop that right in there
1-iy8qmp4l0_19-5-rgb_front there you have it
1-iy8qmp4l0_2-5-rgb_front pour this into your glass just about half way
1-iy8qmp4l0_20-5-rgb_front a detroit daisy
1-iy8qmp4l0_21-5-rgb_front cheers
1-iy8qmp4l0_3-5-rgb_front like so
1-iy8qmp4l0_4-5-rgb_front then we are going to add to this one ounce of dark rum
1-iy8qmp4l0_5-5-rgb_front there we go
1-iy8qmp4l0_6-5-rgb_front next were going to do a few really good squeezes of lime juice
1-iy8qmp4l0_7-5-rgb_front one two three one more four
1-iy8qmp4l0_8-5-rgb_front it is going to be a very sort of drink i guess
1-iy8qmp4l0_9-5-rgb_front go ahead and shake that up
1-qdbgsry7m_0-5-rgb_front in addition to bringing sunscreen to protect yourself from the sun you also need to bring bug spray
1-qdbgsry7m_1-5-rgb_front there is certain times of the year when there will not be bugs and there is certain times of the year when there will be but it is really important to always pack it just in case
1-qdbgsry7m_2-5-rgb_front especially if you are going to be camping near a body of water there is almost always going to be mosquitos because the larvae hatch in the water
1-qdbgsry7m_3-5-rgb_front you also need to bring bug spray that protects against not just mosquitos but all bugs because there is dangerous bugs like ticks
1-qdbgsry7m_4-5-rgb_front ticks can carry lime disease and so you need to get one of the bug sprays that protects against lots of different kinds of bugs
1-qdbgsry7m_5-5-rgb_front also some of the national parks do not approve of bringing aerosol cans so make sure that is in one of the pump spray bottles and make sure that it protects against the other bugs including ticks and make sure to bring your bug spray
1028f1ldkhk_0-5-rgb_front next i am going to show you what is known as the backside fakie also known as a half cab and contrary to the original backside that i showed you that even i have a lot of difficulty with on the ground this is much easier to perform
1028f1ldkhk_1-5-rgb_front what you are going to need to do for this trick is to be comfortable riding in the fakie position that i showed you earlier which is with your feet in the normal position that they would regularly be but you are riding backwards and with the fakie half cab the difference between this backside and a regular one is on a fakie half cab you can see where you are spinning
1028f1ldkhk_2-5-rgb_front so same sort of things to keep in mind with the normal backside is before you spin turn your upper body in the direction that you do not want to spin so you can get some momentum start to ollie and as your foot flies up spin the rest of your body in the direction that you want to turn and you will be able to get the full degrees
1028f1ldkhk_3-5-rgb_front and when you put it all together it looks a little something like this but do not get frustrated when you are trying to do this trick because even i have trouble with the regular ones it just takes a little time and practice
103cpoarue0_0-5-rgb_front hi i am jk dooley i am a professional artist and today we are talking a little bit about giclee reproduction
103cpoarue0_1-5-rgb_front and now we are talking about canvas and choosing canvas to have your prints done on
103cpoarue0_10-5-rgb_front so there is a lot of options here you can go a lot of different sizes which means you can meet a lot of your customer is needs
103cpoarue0_11-5-rgb_front you can take custom orders you can print an image perhaps that you have painted small you can print it really big and that is always kind of fun to do as well
103cpoarue0_12-5-rgb_front so that is one of the really nice things about this process is you can be very versatile when it comes to choosing sizes
103cpoarue0_2-5-rgb_front the nice thing about actually canvas and paper is there are really a lot of sizes that you can choose from
103cpoarue0_3-5-rgb_front as you can see we have got three different sizes here kind of small medium and large
103cpoarue0_4-5-rgb_front but you are basically only limited by the size of your printer
103cpoarue0_5-5-rgb_front so there are printers mine takes up to inches wide
103cpoarue0_6-5-rgb_front so that means your piece can be pretty wide by as long as the roll of canvas is
103cpoarue0_7-5-rgb_front there are printers that are up to inches wide
103cpoarue0_8-5-rgb_front so if you wanting to reproduce a large piece this is a great way to do it
103cpoarue0_9-5-rgb_front and probably apiece that large you are definitely going to want to do on canvas because it is more durable and it will hold up better
10su1bmcfaw_0-5-rgb_front food is a backpacker favorite topic
10su1bmcfaw_1-5-rgb_front if you out there walking and burning a lot of calories
10su1bmcfaw_10-5-rgb_front so there is a whole bunch of different flavors and entries and deserts
10su1bmcfaw_11-5-rgb_front you got ice cream sandwiches
10su1bmcfaw_12-5-rgb_front not a cool thing but it tastes good
10su1bmcfaw_13-5-rgb_front some packaging you will notice are vacuum packed
10su1bmcfaw_14-5-rgb_front the purpose is behind that is if you re going to some place of high altitude these will balloon out as you go up in altitude
10su1bmcfaw_15-5-rgb_front the air pressure inside the pack is grater than the air pressure out
10su1bmcfaw_16-5-rgb_front so that s why they make ones that are vacuum packed
10su1bmcfaw_17-5-rgb_front eggs you want to have ones that when you rehydrate i refer the ones that you can actually kind of scramble in a pan i think they taste better that the ones that you just rehydrate and eat the bag
10su1bmcfaw_18-5-rgb_front but you do not always have to go this rout there is also things at your local grocery store a lipton is noodles and sauce ramen noodles
10su1bmcfaw_19-5-rgb_front freeze dried vegetables you could throw in there
10su1bmcfaw_2-5-rgb_front one thing that s going to be on your mind is food
10su1bmcfaw_20-5-rgb_front tuna packets
10su1bmcfaw_21-5-rgb_front there is a lot of different ways to do it
10su1bmcfaw_22-5-rgb_front not just one way
10su1bmcfaw_23-5-rgb_front you have just got to find the right way for you
10su1bmcfaw_24-5-rgb_front if you have any questions give your local outfitter a holler
10su1bmcfaw_3-5-rgb_front so you need to think about it and how light it s going to be in your pack
10su1bmcfaw_4-5-rgb_front the days of packing out big huge tin cans of food are long gone
10su1bmcfaw_5-5-rgb_front if you thinking about bringing a can of spam you need to think twice
10su1bmcfaw_6-5-rgb_front at an outfitter we carry freeze dried foods basically its a backpackers convenience t v
10su1bmcfaw_7-5-rgb_front dinner
10su1bmcfaw_8-5-rgb_front what you do is you heat water and you pour it in and it hydrates rehydrates in the pouch
10su1bmcfaw_9-5-rgb_front you can actually eat it out of the pouch
10vgbnxgvsk_1-5-rgb_front today we are at chapel ledges in ashfield massachusetts trustees of the reservation property and in this series i am going to be talking about rock climbing gear
10vgbnxgvsk_10-5-rgb_front probably something like this is going to be the easiest to use right off the bat and the thing you are going to choose first
10vgbnxgvsk_2-5-rgb_front i am going to talk about belay devices
10vgbnxgvsk_3-5-rgb_front a belay device is a piece of equipment that is going to let you hang on to your end of the rope and keep your climbing buddy safe up on the cliff
10vgbnxgvsk_4-5-rgb_front a wide variation of them out there these days from the more old fashioned variety of the figure
10vgbnxgvsk_5-5-rgb_front loads up looking like this clip the carabiner onto that this device gives you a lot of flexibility in moving the rope but not a whole lot of friction or assurance in catching a fall
10vgbnxgvsk_6-5-rgb_front more common these days is a device that looks like this generally speaking called an atc type device
10vgbnxgvsk_7-5-rgb_front there are a million brands out there i believe this one is called the sheriff but the function of it all the same by the rope in here clip to the carabiner and this is going to cause enough friction to stop a fall
10vgbnxgvsk_8-5-rgb_front it is a reliable simple easy to use device good friction for catching falls
10vgbnxgvsk_9-5-rgb_front what do you want to choose as a beginner
10vglhbviwi_0-5-rgb_front we are preparing to fill in our trench that we cut into the concrete to install our drains and i have mixed up a bag of premixed concrete or cement and brought it in a bucket and now were going to fill in the hole
10vglhbviwi_1-5-rgb_front when were getting ready to fill in this concrete into out trench the trench is only about three inches deep so we do not need a whole lot of concrete but i want to get it in there and make sure that i have got it filled in and now it does not have to completely plumb with or level with the floor because when we go to set our tile our mastic our glue that we use to set the tile will fill in any differences that we might have in the level of the floor
10vglhbviwi_2-5-rgb_front you might notice that i have got this cardboard in here and the reason for that is that we do not want any concrete around our pee trap if we ever have to remove the pee trap
10vglhbviwi_3-5-rgb_front we pull up the shower pan and the pee trap is assessable we would not have to break out the concrete again
10vglhbviwi_4-5-rgb_front we have mixed up a eighty pound bag of premix concrete out in the wheel barrel and mixed it the wheel barrel with a hoe and then because i did not want to bring the wheel barrel in the house because it leaks i put the concrete in a five gallon bucket and brought it in and you can see i have filled in this much of the trench so far
10vglhbviwi_5-5-rgb_front i was careful to get my concrete under my floor flange so that it holds the drain in place nice and solid and you notice that over here i have got card board damns set up
10vglhbviwi_6-5-rgb_front i do not want any cement over the top of my pee trap if in the future we ever need to get back into this and remove the pee trap for whatever reason we want to have access to it so that s why i have set up these damns
10vglhbviwi_7-5-rgb_front the concrete will pour up against the damn on this side and i have got a little bit over there to fill in and then the floor will be ready for tile
10vglhbviwi_8-5-rgb_front the other thing i have is it is not exactly level with the existing floor and i am not going to worry about that because when we go to set out tile our mastic will make up the difference in the floor level
10vowahh80u_1-5-rgb_front in these clips we are going to talk about some of the tips and tricks in order to properly winterize your vehicle
10vowahh80u_10-5-rgb_front and how high the balls are floating will indicate the level of freeze protection you have
10vowahh80u_11-5-rgb_front right now the gauge is indicating with none of the balls floating that my antifreeze or for demonstration purposes i was using water is going to freeze at degrees fahrenheit or degree celsius
10vowahh80u_12-5-rgb_front what will happen if your antifreeze freezes up inside your engine
10vowahh80u_13-5-rgb_front there are freeze plugs inside of it that will actually pop out and explode causing massive coolant leaks and things of that nature
10vowahh80u_14-5-rgb_front you can also crack your engine block due to the fact that coolant expands when it is frozen
10vowahh80u_15-5-rgb_front what i am going to do now is test the antifreeze in the vehicle itself
10vowahh80u_16_17_18-5-rgb_front i will take the cap off as you can see it says radiator coolant only coolant and antifreeze are the same thing
10vowahh80u_19-5-rgb_front i want to take a snorkel out of what i got on my overflow jug and test what is actually running in my system
10vowahh80u_2-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about the amount of freeze protection your antifreeze happens to be carrying
10vowahh80u_20-5-rgb_front as you can see all of the balls are floating
10vowahh80u_21-5-rgb_front and the very highest measurement i have for freeze protection is in the range of degrees which means the vehicle can be driven almost anywhere on the planet
10vowahh80u_22-5-rgb_front you are going to want to make sure to test your antifreeze every winter
10vowahh80u_23-5-rgb_front this simple step and for the cost of the tool can save you possibly a horrible engine repair
10vowahh80u_24-5-rgb_front this is the proper way to test your antifreeze
10vowahh80u_3-5-rgb_front what i have here in this blue glass is water as you can see
10vowahh80u_4-5-rgb_front i have in my overflow jug coolant
10vowahh80u_5-5-rgb_front what i am going to use is something called a hydrometer
10vowahh80u_6-5-rgb_front on the hydrometer is a scale which will measure at what temperature my antifreeze is going to freeze at
10vowahh80u_7-5-rgb_front just for demonstration purposes i am going to suck up some water in here
10vowahh80u_8-5-rgb_front the number of balls floating is going to correspond with a gauge here on the tool itself written in black
10vowahh80u_9-5-rgb_front we are going to start at the top with degrees
10d1oevikyw_0-5-rgb_front the perfect push up can take place anywhere
10d1oevikyw_1-5-rgb_front we are going to do it out here on the ground
10d1oevikyw_10_11_12_13_14-5-rgb_front do not touch the ground your head is looking down exhale and extend pressing through your palms back up that is one rep inhale down exhale up
10d1oevikyw_15-5-rgb_front inhale down exhale up
10d1oevikyw_16-5-rgb_front you are going to feel this in your triceps the back of your arms
10d1oevikyw_17-5-rgb_front everything nice and tight and in through your chest
10d1oevikyw_18-5-rgb_front now with the outdoors you might feel that you need to get hyped up and do a little bit more
10d1oevikyw_19-5-rgb_front so i am going to take you to your toes
10d1oevikyw_2-5-rgb_front starting with your knees
10d1oevikyw_20-5-rgb_front this is intermediate
10d1oevikyw_21-5-rgb_front still come down exhale up
10d1oevikyw_22-5-rgb_front it s going to be a little tougher but you can do it
10d1oevikyw_23-5-rgb_front inhale down and exhale up
10d1oevikyw_24-5-rgb_front now if you feel like you still want more of a challenge bring your hands in on your toes and go out to the side together
10d1oevikyw_25-5-rgb_front and then to the other side and together
10d1oevikyw_26-5-rgb_front alright
10d1oevikyw_27-5-rgb_front you can work to this
10d1oevikyw_28-5-rgb_front so let is do three more two and one
10d1oevikyw_29-5-rgb_front that is your push up
10d1oevikyw_3-5-rgb_front this is a beginner level
10d1oevikyw_4-5-rgb_front but hold tight i will show you some other variations
10d1oevikyw_5-5-rgb_front first make sure your arms are about shoulder width apart
10d1oevikyw_6-5-rgb_front your hips are down
10d1oevikyw_7-5-rgb_front not too low and not too high
10d1oevikyw_8-5-rgb_front just in the middle
10d1oevikyw_9-5-rgb_front you are going to bend at your elbows
10i-zho6pdw_0-8-rgb_front if you are an amateur hairstylist and you are looking to find a way how to clean off that nasty product off your curling iron well i am a professional so let is take it from me
10i-zho6pdw_1-8-rgb_front i am laura gibson beauty expert and i am here to give you a few tips on how to clean your curling iron
10i-zho6pdw_10-8-rgb_front so there you have it just a few tips on how to stay clean
10i-zho6pdw_2-8-rgb_front there is always the easiest way which is after each use you want to wait for it to cool down because it is hot and you do not want to burn yourself
10i-zho6pdw_3-8-rgb_front as a stylist i can not tell you how many times i have actually burned myself because i do not thing before i do
10i-zho6pdw_4-8-rgb_front so you just want to take it wipe it down regularly
10i-zho6pdw_5-8-rgb_front but then there is some of us who get a little bit lazy and do not always wipe it down
10i-zho6pdw_6-8-rgb_front so we are going to go to our second part of how we would clean it which would be bringing in our back up the oven cleaner
10i-zho6pdw_7-8-rgb_front all you would simply do is apply the oven cleaner with the clamp open
10i-zho6pdw_8-8-rgb_front actually you are going to want to you can hold it or you can wedge something maybe a pencil perhaps in between the clamp and the rod
10i-zho6pdw_9-8-rgb_front then all you want to do is apply the oven cleaner all over take a paper towel wipe it off and then take a damp rag or ordinary towel and get off any of the excess that you missed with your paper towel
10mcocsahvo_0-8-rgb_front our tools are pretty few
10mcocsahvo_1-8-rgb_front be a sportswriter you are going to need a tape recorder a notebook a good supply of pens a good supply of batteries to keep your tape recorder running and then a laptop
10mcocsahvo_10-8-rgb_front probably fax machines
10mcocsahvo_11-8-rgb_front i can even remember telecopiers and these were ways is before even came along i had been doing some of this work
10mcocsahvo_12-8-rgb_front and there was no opportunity to send in a story or send information back and forth through
10mcocsahvo_13-8-rgb_front so it was through fax machines or telecopiers and we have gotten completely rid of those kinds of things in terms of sharing information back and forth or me getting an article into my newspaper
10mcocsahvo_14-8-rgb_front it is all done through now
10mcocsahvo_15-8-rgb_front so it is just much more streamlined now
10mcocsahvo_16-8-rgb_front it is faster and we have definitely ridden the wave of technology in this business like everybody else has
10mcocsahvo_2-8-rgb_front that is really it
10mcocsahvo_3-8-rgb_front most of us do not keep regular office hours
10mcocsahvo_4-8-rgb_front in my case i work more from home and i work more from the college here that i cover than i do actually at the office
10mcocsahvo_5-8-rgb_front so i do not carry a lot of stuff other than a satchel over my shoulder with a laptop and pens and notebooks and tape recorders and that is basically the tools of the trade
10mcocsahvo_6-8-rgb_front you are gathering information and you are sending it into your newspaper through your laptop which you are probably going to need wireless capability on your laptop would be a big help
10mcocsahvo_7-8-rgb_front many of the press boxes that we work in have wireless signals and that helps you transmit your story back to your newspaper
10mcocsahvo_8-8-rgb_front but we do not have a lot
10mcocsahvo_9-8-rgb_front it could be kept in one backpack or one satchel and that is about it
10om04b2liw_0-8-rgb_front ok folks in this clip i am going to teach you how to draw a cartoon fly
10om04b2liw_1-8-rgb_front i am going to come right down here in this corner and do it right here
10om04b2liw_10-8-rgb_front so that just creates the illusion of multiple eyes
10om04b2liw_11-8-rgb_front and we will come out and start drawing the rest of his hulking body
10om04b2liw_12-8-rgb_front we will make him sort of like with his limbs kind of coming off like this
10om04b2liw_13-8-rgb_front and their little front ways position
10om04b2liw_14-8-rgb_front draw his lower body kind of like that
10om04b2liw_15-8-rgb_front hairy disgusting warty creature
10om04b2liw_16-8-rgb_front no one likes flies
10om04b2liw_17-8-rgb_front they are definitely not the most popular insect
10om04b2liw_18-8-rgb_front draw his little legs like that
10om04b2liw_19-8-rgb_front come down here
10om04b2liw_2-8-rgb_front so we will start by drawing the rough shape of his head
10om04b2liw_20-8-rgb_front just kind of make them jagged and ragged
10om04b2liw_21-8-rgb_front and then the way we will draw his wings seems to me flies sort of have distinct wing shapes so what we will do is we will draw we will try to draw his wings as fly shaped as possible
10om04b2liw_22-8-rgb_front to really show that this is in fact a fly
10om04b2liw_23-8-rgb_front and they are sort of veiny and oddly connected
10om04b2liw_24-8-rgb_front so just kind of just get in there and draw some weird sort of connecting veiny type lines to show that this is an ugly fly
10om04b2liw_25-8-rgb_front reinforce your lines
10om04b2liw_26-8-rgb_front and that ought to do it
10om04b2liw_27-8-rgb_front ugly old fly
10om04b2liw_28-8-rgb_front so there you go
10om04b2liw_3-8-rgb_front and flies have those huge hideous eyes
10om04b2liw_4-8-rgb_front so i am going to like leave room around the top for that
10om04b2liw_5-8-rgb_front and also in my mind flies are not the nicest of creatures
10om04b2liw_6-8-rgb_front so we are going to make this guy kind of look a little monstrous
10om04b2liw_7-8-rgb_front first we will add some detail to the eyes here
10om04b2liw_8-8-rgb_front we will come in and we will draw lines going across just like this in both directions
10om04b2liw_9-8-rgb_front because flies obviously have several like i think it is like a hundred eyes or something like that on top of their heads
11g4wcabmwq_0-8-rgb_front this type is a pierrot capelet
11g4wcabmwq_1-8-rgb_front and as i discussed earlier the pierrot part of it comes from this pointy clown like clown suit aspect of the garment
11g4wcabmwq_2-8-rgb_front the capelet part of it is because it is going to be set on top and go down the shoulders like a capelet
11g4wcabmwq_3-8-rgb_front right here we have where it attaches
11g4wcabmwq_4-8-rgb_front what this is doing in the drawing is going to be a separate flouncy piece as the capelet sewn to the garment here and then also done with a zipper
11g4wcabmwq_5-8-rgb_front that just creates something that has more design lines on it than anything else
11g4wcabmwq_6-8-rgb_front but the capelet part is not unattached anymore
11g4wcabmwq_7-8-rgb_front so technically this is what it is called but it is one whole piece of whatever it is shirt that you are doing
11g4wcabmwq_8-8-rgb_front it just has several different variations
11g4wcabmwq_9-8-rgb_front different ways of opening it per say
11mdtwbchk0_0-8-rgb_front let is talk about a safety technique for ice fishing and that involves what are called ice creepers
11mdtwbchk0_1-8-rgb_front when i got to the lake this morning i immediately looked around and said this looks like a skating rink
11mdtwbchk0_10-8-rgb_front then when you walk this will give you the stability that you need
11mdtwbchk0_11-8-rgb_front you do not slip it grips very very well and it will keep you from getting injured or from damaging your equipment
11mdtwbchk0_2-8-rgb_front this ice is slick
11mdtwbchk0_3-8-rgb_front if i walk around with just my regular boots carrying all my gear be it the auger or my tackle there is a good chance that i am going to slip i am going to hurt myself maybe break some equipment
11mdtwbchk0_4-8-rgb_front so i always carry ice creepers with me
11mdtwbchk0_5-8-rgb_front there is a couple different styles
11mdtwbchk0_6-8-rgb_front this one is simply a more of an elastic strap that fits around your boot and it hooks back to here
11mdtwbchk0_7-8-rgb_front again these sit on the bottom of your boot so that they come in contact with the ice and give you some stability
11mdtwbchk0_8-8-rgb_front there is another type which simply has a clip and a strap and all you do is carefully put that over
11mdtwbchk0_9-8-rgb_front make sure that the bottom of it is facing downward and then you just cinch it up as tight as you can again making certain as you can see that it is on the bottom of your boot
11qbsm0-df4_1-8-rgb_front today we will be taking about beginning sabre fencing
11qbsm0-df4_10-8-rgb_front my back leg is straight
11qbsm0-df4_11-8-rgb_front my back is straight
11qbsm0-df4_12-8-rgb_front my arms and shoulder are relaxed not locked
11qbsm0-df4_13-8-rgb_front once again slow beginning easy and relaxed
11qbsm0-df4_14-8-rgb_front eyes forward
11qbsm0-df4_15-8-rgb_front very relaxed muscles
11qbsm0-df4_16-8-rgb_front do not be tense
11qbsm0-df4_17-8-rgb_front do not be off balanced
11qbsm0-df4_18-8-rgb_front be comfortable
11qbsm0-df4_2-8-rgb_front later i will be talking a lot more about lunges but here i will just give you a brief introduction
11qbsm0-df4_3-8-rgb_front while we know about moving like so forward and backward it is very important also to be able to make a lunge
11qbsm0-df4_4-8-rgb_front why is a lunge important
11qbsm0-df4_5-8-rgb_front we are not going to want to get so close that we hit just with an advanced we want to be able to start our attack from further away
11qbsm0-df4_6-8-rgb_front you remember i talked about who starts the attack first gets the point
11qbsm0-df4_7-8-rgb_front so acceleration lines i turn my arms slowly
11qbsm0-df4_8-8-rgb_front i begin extending them at extension the rest of my movement begins and i have finished my extension
11qbsm0-df4_9-8-rgb_front my knee is above the heel
11ypodiy44o_0-8-rgb_front what is up
11ypodiy44o_10-8-rgb_front cleanliness is next to god in the prison system because you do not have a lot space and because there is a lot of confinement you can find yourself subject to different infections and diseases illnesses that you may not necessarily come across so readily if you were out walking around in the streets everyday
11ypodiy44o_11-8-rgb_front but they do provide you with a lot of cleaning supplies
11ypodiy44o_12-8-rgb_front you can keep your environment very clean it helps you it helps your roommate it helps the people around you and keeps the peace to a very great level
11ypodiy44o_13-8-rgb_front it is a small space that you are living in you have got to figure out different ways to do it different ways to manipulate it so that you are not in violation of the rules of the institution or in violation of other people is space and it is not an easy thing to do
11ypodiy44o_2-8-rgb_front in this clip i will be discussing the importance of understanding how to live in a dorm a pod or a room setting in the prison system
11ypodiy44o_3-8-rgb_front a lot of people have a misconcept about it they think that people are sitting on cots behind bars and quiet usually that is not the case
11ypodiy44o_4-8-rgb_front the county jail basically houses people in the forms of pods where they have several different rooms inside of the pods and you are living in a space that is extremely small without any storage
11ypodiy44o_5-8-rgb_front once you get to the state institution level or the prerelease central level you may find yourself in a dorm style setting with a rows upon rows with steal bunk beds and the only space that is actually yours is that that exist between the two of your bed and the bed next to you and a lock box that slides underneath the bottom bunk
11ypodiy44o_6-8-rgb_front that lock box is usually about x feet and it is about a foot deep
11ypodiy44o_7-8-rgb_front so you have got to figure out a way to confine your living and all of the things that you own or possess in a very small environment
11ypodiy44o_8-8-rgb_front once you get to the prerealese level you may be fortunate enough to stay in a room with maybe only or other people a man room total
11ypodiy44o_9-8-rgb_front under those circumstances you begin to realize that there are certain things you have to do in order to be comfortable and healthy as well
11yofc1i8zc_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk to you about the common mistakes that players will make
11yofc1i8zc_1-8-rgb_front we are talking about all levels
11yofc1i8zc_10-8-rgb_front so we will see what he does right here
11yofc1i8zc_11-8-rgb_front his first move he is stepping out and then he runs
11yofc1i8zc_12-8-rgb_front he turns his upper body right away he runs over
11yofc1i8zc_13-8-rgb_front step out and then the run
11yofc1i8zc_14-8-rgb_front see that a lot quicker
11yofc1i8zc_15-8-rgb_front he is going to be able to get there a lot earlier and when you are there early you have options
11yofc1i8zc_16-8-rgb_front that is very very important right there
11yofc1i8zc_2-8-rgb_front club players sometimes even tournament players in their first move to the ball
11yofc1i8zc_3-8-rgb_front a lot of players will just shuffle to the ball making them a lot slower and they do not get their rotation and by the time they get to the ball they are playing
11yofc1i8zc_4-8-rgb_front so watch this
11yofc1i8zc_5-8-rgb_front this is the common mistake
11yofc1i8zc_6-8-rgb_front see how he is shuffling to the ball he cannot get in position does not get his feet organized to the ball and he is doing the crab walk
11yofc1i8zc_7-8-rgb_front it does not even look good
11yofc1i8zc_8-8-rgb_front so now we will show you what you want to do as opposed to that
11yofc1i8zc_9-8-rgb_front the movement is that the first move has to be a step out your right foot is going to come out of the forehand side you are getting your rotation and then you can officially run to the ball and not shuffle to the ball
11aqpfa6zgo_0-8-rgb_front alright we have introduce forward rolling
11aqpfa6zgo_1-8-rgb_front so let is continue along that vein
11aqpfa6zgo_10-8-rgb_front so you have to maintain and you have to be completely and totally aware that when you are forward rolling hands are down stand up make sure that there is strength and stability in this area
11aqpfa6zgo_11-8-rgb_front okay
11aqpfa6zgo_12-8-rgb_front so always roll it is always a ball it is always form and fashion of a ball
11aqpfa6zgo_13-8-rgb_front the function of a ball
11aqpfa6zgo_14-8-rgb_front so now i mean it is not complex but it does not feel very good when you mess it up
11aqpfa6zgo_15-8-rgb_front so one more time
11aqpfa6zgo_16-8-rgb_front forward roll you should come up to the exact same position you started at for right now
11aqpfa6zgo_2-8-rgb_front the principle of rolling is that of a ball meaning you roll a ball
11aqpfa6zgo_3-8-rgb_front a ball rolls rather redundant
11aqpfa6zgo_4-8-rgb_front needless to say on this the things you have to be very aware of is you have to be aware of where your hips are
11aqpfa6zgo_5-8-rgb_front a very common issue a very common problem that people encounter is that when they are rolling they have a tendency to lose that structure
11aqpfa6zgo_6-8-rgb_front and to lose the strength
11aqpfa6zgo_7-8-rgb_front and so it causes the hip to flop and you get a hip that lands hard or the feet fly out
11aqpfa6zgo_8-8-rgb_front things happen people get hurt you twist the back or something
11aqpfa6zgo_9-8-rgb_front those are the most common injuries to occur
11b-djymb2m_0-8-rgb_front now let me show you how to add a little color to the windmill
11b-djymb2m_1-8-rgb_front we are going to decorate the roof we will make a few decorations but first we will decorate the roof and we are going to use our match sticks again the way we do is this is we coat the top of the milk carton that angles down with glue and we can either brush it on with a paint brush or we can have the kids who are doing the project if they want to just smear with their finger and while it is still wet
11b-djymb2m_2-8-rgb_front we lay across the match sticks we use a solid color be kind of like a red tile roof so we choose for this project all the red match sticks and we will lay them across the top of the milk carton
11b-djymb2m_3-8-rgb_front using the solid color is recommended because we have a lot of colors on the arms of the windmill so we do not want to make it too busy
11b-djymb2m_4-8-rgb_front and the red itself also gives a nice realistic touch to it that it looks actually like a roof
11b-djymb2m_5-8-rgb_front so the match sticks actually fit nicely across the top of the windmill they do not have to fit exactly the same measurement as the top of the carton but if you lay them across if you double them up even though they hang over a little bit they still fit nicely onto the side of the milk carton and we only have to do one side the side obviously in the front that is going to be seen and we go all the way down to the bottom of where it angles and starts going vertical again
11b-djymb2m_6-8-rgb_front this is really just for decoration and it is not a necessary part of the project obviously if you want to paint directly onto the milk carton different designs or different types of pictures you could also do that
11b-djymb2m_7-8-rgb_front so here is our red tile roof for our windmill
11bx6_dm6uq_1-8-rgb_front so still working with the hand and working each finger individually is going to help benefit not only the hand itself and the bones and joints and muscles of the hand but also again tapping into the connection with the thumb the next finger to the collarbone the pinkie to the heart and the other three fingers that dive right directly into the shoulder socket
11bx6_dm6uq_10-8-rgb_front it feels really good
11bx6_dm6uq_2-8-rgb_front so you can move each finger independently of the others in a stretching fashion
11bx6_dm6uq_3-8-rgb_front and i am supporting from the underside with my thumb
11bx6_dm6uq_4-8-rgb_front i am making this look easy
11bx6_dm6uq_5-8-rgb_front i have quite a bit of range in my hands because this is something that i do weekly if not almost daily
11bx6_dm6uq_6-8-rgb_front important is the thumb right because he is always in this position
11bx6_dm6uq_7-8-rgb_front so this thenar muscle really needs to get a stretch
11bx6_dm6uq_8-8-rgb_front and you can see when you come out of these stretches how red the hand gets because we are generating some good circulation
11bx6_dm6uq_9-8-rgb_front so it gets flushed with blood
11cwpeadjzc_0-8-rgb_front have you ever wondered on how often you should wear your night guard
11cwpeadjzc_1-8-rgb_front well my name is michelle and i am a dental assistant with solutionz and i am here to explain to you on how often you should wear it
11cwpeadjzc_2-8-rgb_front basically if you have been prescribed by your general dentist to wear a night guard because you tend to maybe grind your teeth at night or to wear a night guard during the day while you are driving cause you get tense and you grind your teeth
11cwpeadjzc_3-8-rgb_front but that is something wearing a night guard is something you definitely want to wear on a consistent basis every night
11cwpeadjzc_4-8-rgb_front it is pretty easy after you brush and floss your teeth before you go to bed you just pop in your night guard wear it for those eight hours or six hours of sleep that you are getting
11cwpeadjzc_5-8-rgb_front and then take it out in the morning rinse it off even maybe you know rinse it off with your toothbrush and toothpaste to kind of keep it clean of that excess film that you might have left on it
11cwpeadjzc_6-8-rgb_front but if you have been prescribed by your general dentist to wear a night guard you definitely want to wear it every night on a regular basis because by doing so you are going to be training your actual jaw joints to kind of not become so tense
11cwpeadjzc_7-8-rgb_front you have to basically you are retraining those tmj joints to kind of stay propped open and you are providing cushion for them so the more that you can wear it the better it will be for you in the long run but yes every night definitely wear your night guard if you have been prescribed to wear it during driving every time you get in the car pop it in
11cwpeadjzc_8-8-rgb_front it is only going to be a benefit for you in the future
11cwpeadjzc_9-8-rgb_front once again my name is michelle and i am a dental assistant with solutionz and i just explained to you on how often to wear your night guard
11dft7iy3ki_0-8-rgb_front alright so we have gone over two kinds of naps so far out of the basic upper body hitting type of naps and the third one we are going to go over is the team nap
11dft7iy3ki_1-8-rgb_front you can use this with punches but usually you use this with just slaps
11dft7iy3ki_2-8-rgb_front so what is going to happen instead of just shaun or just me making the sound when the action happens we are both going to do it together as part of the action
11dft7iy3ki_3-8-rgb_front so we are going to start off like we always do with making sure we have our distance eye contact to let each other know that we are going to start the movement then i am going to wind up like this
11dft7iy3ki_4-8-rgb_front notice where shaun has his hand
11dft7iy3ki_5-8-rgb_front shaun has his hand in place for me to hit it when i do but he put it on his chest he did not put it near his face he did not put it out some crazy place but he put it right there where it could be hidden from the audience and it will still be affective to make the sound
11dft7iy3ki_6-8-rgb_front so like i said i am going to wind up real big start off real slow slap and then shaun is going to react accordingly
11dft7iy3ki_7-8-rgb_front so let is try that one more time speed it up a little bit
11dft7iy3ki_8-8-rgb_front so put your hand down remember you do not start with it so hands on the shoulder establish distance eye contact wind up and remember always follow through and until you are ready go only about
11iwfcsb038_0-8-rgb_front alright
11iwfcsb038_1-8-rgb_front as you can see we have gotten all the handrails completely stained the spindles everything down to the deck
11iwfcsb038_2-8-rgb_front we have the house taped and papered off over here down by the bottom
11iwfcsb038_3-8-rgb_front and we are ready to stain the actual decking itself
11iwfcsb038_4-8-rgb_front we are going to go ahead we are going to cut in all the way along the side of the house one with a brush
11iwfcsb038_5-8-rgb_front we are going to do the same on the opposite side of the deck by the spindles and handrails
11iwfcsb038_6-8-rgb_front and then up here on this end of the deck you can see we have got some stain on the actual decking from the spindles
11iwfcsb038_7_8_9-8-rgb_front and what we can do we will brush that in but we will do that as we go and as we work our way across the deck we will brush that in there and blend that stain out so we have got an even color when we come in with our mop head
11napvmqepi_1-8-rgb_front and today i will be talking to you about developing your plot
11napvmqepi_10-8-rgb_front a play moves in a forward progression towards its ending
11napvmqepi_11-8-rgb_front options become lower
11napvmqepi_12-8-rgb_front people try different tactics to get what they want and strong objectives
11napvmqepi_13-8-rgb_front people are willing to die for whatever they want
11napvmqepi_14-8-rgb_front its high stakes the highest stakes you can possibly make or what would make a good drama
11napvmqepi_15-8-rgb_front and so this is the chart that makes our course
11napvmqepi_16-8-rgb_front also starting with the ending moving backwards as a way to try to understand how to incorporate elements of foreshadowing of setting things up and paying them off of creating hooks and creating dramatic situations and this is the fundamental of plot
11napvmqepi_2-8-rgb_front so during this series we have gone over the plot
11napvmqepi_3-8-rgb_front you start at the beginning we have established the status quo just where everything starts in the beginning of the play
11napvmqepi_4-8-rgb_front also noting that the status quo is not the beginning of time things will have happened before the status quo
11napvmqepi_5-8-rgb_front we have gone over the inciting incident the thing that jumps starts the action of the play
11napvmqepi_6-8-rgb_front we have gone over the hook the act one hook
11napvmqepi_7-8-rgb_front we have gone over the payoff in act two and how things are foreshadowed in act one
11napvmqepi_8-8-rgb_front and we have gone over the climax the highest point of action in the play and the resolution leading to the end
11napvmqepi_9-8-rgb_front these are the elements of a plot of the play
11oewlbqf2m_0-8-rgb_front in this clip i am going to talk to you about some other accessories that make turning a bowl on a lathe a much more pleasurable experience
11oewlbqf2m_1-8-rgb_front the first thing you might need is a compass
11oewlbqf2m_10-8-rgb_front it is nice to be able to use around areas or curves where a tape measure would not fit
11oewlbqf2m_11-8-rgb_front these are calipers
11oewlbqf2m_12-8-rgb_front the calipers are used to measure the wall thickness of your bowl
11oewlbqf2m_13-8-rgb_front when you turn a bowl you want to make sure that your wall thickness is uniform all the way through because if as you are roughing out a bowl and its green wood if your wall thickness is not uniform you are going to have cracking and the bowl blank will be useless
11oewlbqf2m_2-8-rgb_front this compass can draw a circle on a half a log up to three inches in diameter
11oewlbqf2m_3-8-rgb_front so it is not the same kind of compass that you might have used in grade school
11oewlbqf2m_4-8-rgb_front you do have to get this from a wood turning or wood working specialty store
11oewlbqf2m_5-8-rgb_front it has a carbide chip scribe which is used to scribe your circle but i could replace this with a pencil or a pen if i wanted to
11oewlbqf2m_6-8-rgb_front tape measure
11oewlbqf2m_7-8-rgb_front always very easy and very handy to have around
11oewlbqf2m_8-8-rgb_front other measuring devices
11oewlbqf2m_9-8-rgb_front this is a flexible curve ruler
11pwsxwid2a_0-8-rgb_front hello my name is jill weiss and i am going to tell you a little bit about how to play shortstop
11pwsxwid2a_1-8-rgb_front first thing you want to remember is that the shortstop is one of those positions where you have got to be a lot of places
11pwsxwid2a_10-8-rgb_front the shortstop is one of those positions where they are probably one of the strongest arms on the field
11pwsxwid2a_11_12_13-8-rgb_front they have to cross throwing from shortstop all the way to first base they have to be agile they have to be quick
11pwsxwid2a_14-8-rgb_front they have got to be moving on their feet constantly moving and constantly thinking two plays ahead
11pwsxwid2a_15-8-rgb_front always ok there is a runner on second what am i going to do if this ball is hit to me
11pwsxwid2a_16-8-rgb_front situations like that
11pwsxwid2a_17-8-rgb_front when you are fielding the ball you always want to get in front of it
11pwsxwid2a_18-8-rgb_front look at it all the way in
11pwsxwid2a_19-8-rgb_front use two hands if you have to things like that
11pwsxwid2a_2-8-rgb_front you have got to be thinking all the time and you could be covering second base
11pwsxwid2a_20-8-rgb_front just remember as a shortstop that you have always got to be thinking
11pwsxwid2a_21-8-rgb_front my name is jill weiss and those are just a few tips on how to be a shortstop
11pwsxwid2a_3-8-rgb_front you could be covering first base
11pwsxwid2a_4-8-rgb_front you could be catching a fly ball into the outfield
11pwsxwid2a_5-8-rgb_front you could be charging a slap a bunt but you have always got to be communicating
11pwsxwid2a_6-8-rgb_front that is the most important thing
11pwsxwid2a_7-8-rgb_front communicating with your second basemen on who is covering
11pwsxwid2a_8-8-rgb_front communicating with your third basemen in case there is a steal
11pwsxwid2a_9-8-rgb_front communicating with your catcher communicating with your pitcher things like that
11whcauxiqc_0-8-rgb_front now this wall here which is actually a wall that covers up the entrance to the restrooms this is the wall that we are going to be showing the painting from beginning to end for this particular filming
11whcauxiqc_1-8-rgb_front so here again we are going to have a hilltop
11whcauxiqc_10-8-rgb_front and i will probably extend that all the way through the rest of the mural with an idea of trees
11whcauxiqc_11-8-rgb_front so what you have is this very strong foreground with the tigers and the flowers and the tree and again all the flowers with the tiger
11whcauxiqc_12-8-rgb_front i am thinking i might put a baby tiger in here as well so that it looks like mother and baby together and then the tree again
11whcauxiqc_13-8-rgb_front and then everything else fades off into the distance
11whcauxiqc_14-8-rgb_front so then we have the powerful images in the foreground the two tigers the baby tiger all the hilltops covered wild beautiful flowers the two mango trees
11whcauxiqc_15-8-rgb_front it is very strong in detail in the foreground including the tiger here that we are going to use for this particular project
11whcauxiqc_16-8-rgb_front and then everything else slowly fades out into the snowcapped mountains in the background and the blue cloudy sky to give a feeling of depth
11whcauxiqc_17-8-rgb_front like whoever is eating in the restaurant will feel like they are looking out into the distance and into the mountains
11whcauxiqc_18-8-rgb_front so this is as i said a very rough sketch
11whcauxiqc_19-8-rgb_front the next thing that i will do is come up with a few more ideas and then i will do another rough sketch which i will present to the owner for him to have a visual idea of what the whole thing is going to look like
11whcauxiqc_2-8-rgb_front we are going to have another tiger sitting on this hilltop against rocks and the water opening up into lakes behind him
11whcauxiqc_20-8-rgb_front and then i will wait for his reaction to that
11whcauxiqc_3-8-rgb_front so understand at this point this is a very very very rough sketch
11whcauxiqc_4-8-rgb_front i am not looking for accuracy i am just looking for ideas
11whcauxiqc_5-8-rgb_front so i have also now decided how to get rid of this corner in the wall
11whcauxiqc_6-8-rgb_front i am going to paint a tree coming up so it takes up the whole of that corner
11whcauxiqc_7-8-rgb_front and then this tree will carry a fruit probably mangoes
11whcauxiqc_8-8-rgb_front i like the idea of mangoes because mangoes are a fruit that honor the god ganesha the indian elephant god
11whcauxiqc_9-8-rgb_front and then i think i am also going to take another tree up this corner again with mango fruit hanging down from it
11yspjnrn4y_1-1-rgb_front so now we are going to talk about the zones and there are three zones in handwriting
11yspjnrn4y_10-1-rgb_front the upper zone that represents these upper strokes
11yspjnrn4y_11-1-rgb_front the lower zone that represents the lower strokes alright
11yspjnrn4y_12-1-rgb_front so what do they all mean the three zones
11yspjnrn4y_13-1-rgb_front well the middle zone we are talking about the day to day aspects of life
11yspjnrn4y_14-1-rgb_front everyday aspects of life its social interactions
11yspjnrn4y_15-1-rgb_front someone who has a middle zone that is very pronounced is someone who just gets on great with people and they are very kind of focused on the day to day activities and social interactions
11yspjnrn4y_16-1-rgb_front and the people who have a pronounced upper zone that the upper zone influences our mental thought and also our spirituality
11yspjnrn4y_17-1-rgb_front so there are people who are interested in thoughts in spirituality in mental processes intellect things like that
11yspjnrn4y_18-1-rgb_front the lower zone that is all talking about material things
11yspjnrn4y_19-1-rgb_front the people who are interested in making money eating satisfying their material wants and needs and desires things like that
11yspjnrn4y_2-1-rgb_front you have got the middle zone the upper zone and the lower zone
11yspjnrn4y_20-1-rgb_front ok so when you are looking at a person is handwriting you are just having a look to see which of these zones is most pronounced or you might find that somebody has very even distribution of zones
11yspjnrn4y_21-1-rgb_front or you might find that their upper or lower zone is very pronounced
11yspjnrn4y_22-1-rgb_front for example you can have someone whose upper zone is so pronounced that you have maybe got a very high loop there and that would be someone who is very spiritual kind of head in the clouds
11yspjnrn4y_23-1-rgb_front or similarly if you have someone with a very pronounced lower loop is someone who is very interested in their physical drives
11yspjnrn4y_24-1-rgb_front ok so for our next clip we are going to talk about the form of the writing
11yspjnrn4y_3-1-rgb_front and as you can see from lou is it looks like his upper zone is fairly pronounced here
11yspjnrn4y_4-1-rgb_front i would say that the upper zone is the most pronounced
11yspjnrn4y_5-1-rgb_front and let me show you that in a little bit more detail
11yspjnrn4y_6-1-rgb_front so what happens is of the three zones you have got your middle here you have got your upper and you have got your lower
11yspjnrn4y_7_8-1-rgb_front so if you were to write a word such as happy that can show you all three of your zones
11yspjnrn4y_9-1-rgb_front so as you can see the middle zone that represents the middle of the letter right
1262lussvgu_0-8-rgb_front we are going to measure from the table in my case i am measuring the about the center of this slot right here which is in this case going to be and inch an inch and an inch and
1262lussvgu_1-8-rgb_front yours might be different yours might have holes in it in which case you want to measure up to the very center of your hole transfer that measurement as i have already done on this piece of wood and that is an inch and a half and i have made an inch and a half line here and i want to give you a little tip about this about making that line
1262lussvgu_2-8-rgb_front usually a pencil will have a conical tip on it but what we want to do with our pencil is take a little piece of sandpaper and put the pencil flat on the sandpaper and rub it back and forth like that so we make a chisel point
1262lussvgu_3-8-rgb_front that is because a round point pencil will never quite fit right in here where you need to make your line
1262lussvgu_4-8-rgb_front if it has conical point that point of the led is always just a little bit away so when we make this line with our chisel point pencil the pencil fits right there and makes a nice smooth line
1262lussvgu_5-8-rgb_front we now have this line cut and so we know where the slot is going to go
12awan9ais4_0-8-rgb_front we are going to add a drip irrigation on this raised bed and the main reasons that most people put drip irrigation in is because they can put it on a timer and they do not have to worry about it
12awan9ais4_1-8-rgb_front drip irrigation is important for a number of things and one of the main reasons is that it supplies an adequate moisture situation to a plant during the growing time without interruption
12awan9ais4_2-8-rgb_front you can not rely on the rain and also i think i mentioned before that a raised bed is cut off from the soil in such a way that it does not allow moisture to rise from below which happens a lot of times in a natural garden situation
12awan9ais4_3-8-rgb_front even though it is dry on the surface during the evening and at night moisture will rise from below and your plants can get a little bit of that moisture
12awan9ais4_4-8-rgb_front where in these beds if they do not come from the top or from artificial means it are not going to happen
12awan9ais4_5-8-rgb_front so drip irrigation is a serious consideration when it comes to raised beds or any kind of container garden because other wise you are going to be out there every day watering and a lot of people will miss it
12awan9ais4_6-8-rgb_front drip irrigation comes several ways
12awan9ais4_7-8-rgb_front we are going to be showing buttonless installation which is a very targeted way of watering
12awan9ais4_8-8-rgb_front it allows you to put water exactly where you want it and then we are going to be demonstrating one that is more or a shotgun approach which broadcasts the water to a larger area
12q2z61azpg_0-8-rgb_front now of course the slab roller is the easier way to go but not everybody owns that piece of equipment so i am going to show you how to make a nice slab of clay with just a rolling pin and your table
12q2z61azpg_1-8-rgb_front now my table here is covered in canvas that way when i am throwing the clay it is not sticking it gives it a nice surface to absorb a little bit of the water as well if you are letting your clay set up
12q2z61azpg_10-8-rgb_front helps to to clean off your knife first
12q2z61azpg_11-8-rgb_front and you are just compressing the clay and smoothing the surface
12q2z61azpg_12-8-rgb_front you did get some compression with that rolling pin but this gives you just a little bit more
12q2z61azpg_13-8-rgb_front and if you have a few ridges that is okay because we are probably going to end up wiping those out in the next steps of the process
12q2z61azpg_14-8-rgb_front so now we have a nice slab of clay
12q2z61azpg_2-8-rgb_front so in order to make a nice big slab with the rolling pin i am going to stretch this out a little bit more
12q2z61azpg_3-8-rgb_front i probably want to get it to be in the end a little bit more than a quarter of inch thick
12q2z61azpg_4-8-rgb_front that is a good thickness to be sturdy enough to use and thick you know thick enough to hold up
12q2z61azpg_5-8-rgb_front so i have got it a little bit thicker than that right now
12q2z61azpg_6-8-rgb_front i am going to take my really big rolling pin here and i am just going to kind of stretch that out a little bit more and make it nice and smooth
12q2z61azpg_7-8-rgb_front having a really wide rolling pin helps because then you are more likely to have the same thickness all the way across
12q2z61azpg_8-8-rgb_front if you have a really thin rolling pin you are going to have to do it in a couple of different places and you might end up with ridges in the middle
12q2z61azpg_9-8-rgb_front so once you have got it rolled out to about the thickness that you want you want to take some kind of drywall knife and smooth the surface
12y6ujgj_2q_0-8-rgb_front we are going to show you some of the different techniques for applying vehicle graphics and decals
12y6ujgj_2q_1-8-rgb_front at this time i am going to show you how to do the center hinge wet application method
12y6ujgj_2q_10-8-rgb_front you want to pick the tape up pull away the masking from the vinyl
12y6ujgj_2q_11-8-rgb_front at which point you will come in and tear the protective backing off
12y6ujgj_2q_12-8-rgb_front take your application fluid get it nice and wet
12y6ujgj_2q_13-8-rgb_front lay the vinyl back over and take your squeegee
12y6ujgj_2q_14-8-rgb_front firmly press the vinyl down to secure the area
12y6ujgj_2q_15-8-rgb_front in doing this this will take all the excess water out from underneath the masking tape
12y6ujgj_2q_16_17-8-rgb_front once you get this side down you want to take the tape off the other side take the second piece of tape off that you used for your hinge
12y6ujgj_2q_18-8-rgb_front now that you have this side this acts as your hinge
12y6ujgj_2q_19-8-rgb_front you want to peel this tape off apply your application fluid and again always squeegee from the hinge or the tape line out
12y6ujgj_2q_2-8-rgb_front first before you actually apply it you want to find the center mark of the roof of the are that you are going to mark
12y6ujgj_2q_20-8-rgb_front once you have it squeegeed you can simply take your masking slowly peeling it way keeping it as close to the masking as possible
12y6ujgj_2q_21-8-rgb_front as you see here i peeled the letter up because of the moisture underneath it
12y6ujgj_2q_22-8-rgb_front simply take your squeegee with the felt side and squeegee it back down
12y6ujgj_2q_23-8-rgb_front make sure you apply firm pressure across all of it removing any water bubbles
12y6ujgj_2q_24-8-rgb_front now you have applied using the center hinge wet method application
12y6ujgj_2q_3-8-rgb_front lay your vinyl on here measure it up
12y6ujgj_2q_4-8-rgb_front i measured from the top of the back of the window to a center mark so it is centered where i want it
12y6ujgj_2q_5-8-rgb_front then you want to take your tape and make a mark
12y6ujgj_2q_6-8-rgb_front this mark being the center hinge area
12y6ujgj_2q_7-8-rgb_front you simply want to peel it off thus making the hinge method
12y6ujgj_2q_8-8-rgb_front with the hinge method it is best to start from the side of the center line that you do not have any vinyl there on the tape
12y6ujgj_2q_9-8-rgb_front therefore i will start on this side with the
12_pwbui3mm_1-8-rgb_front letters words and spacing
12_pwbui3mm_10-8-rgb_front the next concept is turning the page
12_pwbui3mm_11-8-rgb_front the word open the cover
12_pwbui3mm_12-8-rgb_front two important concepts that we are going to look at in the next lesson
12_pwbui3mm_2-8-rgb_front in our last lesson we looked at the importance of saying something as simple as i let is take a leap spy to point out that they are two separate words
12_pwbui3mm_3-8-rgb_front another part of letters words and spacing because on every book the illustrator may be somewhere different the title may be somewhere different and in some cases they may not even list an illustrator
12_pwbui3mm_4_5-8-rgb_front the most important part of this is to say let is start from the top ready to read three little pigs and there is a beautiful picture here
12_pwbui3mm_6-8-rgb_front let is turn it over and see if we see anything on the back cover but in this particular book green eggs and ham is the title with the picture
12_pwbui3mm_7-8-rgb_front that is the author by dr seuss
12_pwbui3mm_8-8-rgb_front we are continually pointing out that words have spaces that are made up of letters
12_pwbui3mm_9-8-rgb_front we start from the top and work our way to the bottom

13omn2p3dca_1-8-rgb_front today i am given you some gift ideas for christmas gifts for your uncle
13omn2p3dca_10-8-rgb_front it is actually a very personalized very tailor gift
13omn2p3dca_11-8-rgb_front this one is micro suede
13omn2p3dca_12-8-rgb_front it was very economical
13omn2p3dca_13-8-rgb_front i am sure they come in a variety of price ranges
13omn2p3dca_14-8-rgb_front the only thing you are going to need to remember to do is get his shoe size
13omn2p3dca_15-8-rgb_front you can either ask your parents or your aunt if your uncle is married or you can just go ahead and buy what size you think he might wear
13omn2p3dca_16-8-rgb_front be sure to keep the receipt so he can exchange it but honestly i really do not think you can go wrong with something like this
13omn2p3dca_2-8-rgb_front now even if your uncle is so hard to shop for because he has everything or you just really do not know his taste i really do not think that you can go wrong by getting him a pair of slippers
13omn2p3dca_3-8-rgb_front most people like to wear slippers and with it being christmas it is obviously going to be cooler weather so it is actually a nice gift to keep there feet nice and warm
13omn2p3dca_4-8-rgb_front i give them every year
13omn2p3dca_5-8-rgb_front i give this new pair of slippers to every member of my family
13omn2p3dca_6-8-rgb_front it is my thing it is what i like to do
13omn2p3dca_7-8-rgb_front but this year when i was out shopping i actually found something that i have not seen before and that is memory foam slippers
13omn2p3dca_8-8-rgb_front so every time that you put your foot in it works very much like the memory foam pillows and mattresses
13omn2p3dca_9-8-rgb_front it will actually remember your uncles in step and the shape of his foot and how we walks
13sbijnc5qa_0-8-rgb_front we talk about line having character and different qualities of line and sort of the two the basic division is really between diagrammatic line and calligraphic or gestural line
13sbijnc5qa_1-8-rgb_front and diagrammatic line is line used to create a configuration it is the kind of line you use to make a blueprint it is an informative an informational line
13sbijnc5qa_10-8-rgb_front you can get this with a brush or a pencil you can get this with any medium
13sbijnc5qa_11-8-rgb_front but this is the character and it is a much freer more expressive kind of a line
13sbijnc5qa_2-8-rgb_front but you can see here that m c
13sbijnc5qa_3-8-rgb_front escher used it this whole drawing is created with line
13sbijnc5qa_4-8-rgb_front he uses the line he uses the straight edge pretty much to create these lines
13sbijnc5qa_5-8-rgb_front the whole drawing is created with these lines and he is managed to give a feeling because he is using all these very straight lines with rulers he is giving you the sense of a universe that is very controlled and very predictable at the same time that he is challenging you by making these people go in staircases that are going down into nowhere and up into nowhere and the whole space is basically undogmatic
13sbijnc5qa_6-8-rgb_front the other thing that diagrammatic lines can do is they can create different shadows
13sbijnc5qa_7-8-rgb_front and you can see here he created a dark versus a light and that has to do with how close the lines are together and how thick they are
13sbijnc5qa_8-8-rgb_front he uses very thin lines where it is very light he uses very thick lines where it is dark
13sbijnc5qa_9-8-rgb_front that is compared to this would be using a calligraphic or gestural line and you can see it is much more
13x0vemnm7m_0-5-rgb_front cindy mastry in this clip faith is going to help me demonstrate how you can take the standing split bow variation of the standing split to an even more advance pose
13x0vemnm7m_1-5-rgb_front so using the blocks that is going to help her be able to balance more easily and elevate the floor a little bit higher so it can take out any problems she might have with tight hamstrings or a tight low spine
13x0vemnm7m_10-5-rgb_front it does not have to come up very far
13x0vemnm7m_11-5-rgb_front it does not matter
13x0vemnm7m_12-5-rgb_front good
13x0vemnm7m_13-5-rgb_front it is not is not a competition
13x0vemnm7m_14-5-rgb_front she is going to bend her knee and bring her heel back in close to her body giving her a really great nice quad stretch
13x0vemnm7m_15-5-rgb_front good
13x0vemnm7m_16-5-rgb_front she is going to engage her core and ground right through her foot engage her glute and reach back and grab onto her foot
13x0vemnm7m_17-5-rgb_front yes
13x0vemnm7m_18-5-rgb_front so she needs to focus and breathe maybe even come through a little arch in the spine as she presses her hand right down into the earth and lengthens up with her foot
13x0vemnm7m_19-5-rgb_front and that is a beautiful advance split bow variation
13x0vemnm7m_2-5-rgb_front she is going to inhale and extend her arms up to the sky into a beautiful mountain pose
13x0vemnm7m_3-5-rgb_front pressing into her feet she is going to lengthen up and then fold forward
13x0vemnm7m_4-5-rgb_front good
13x0vemnm7m_5-5-rgb_front placing her hands on the block
13x0vemnm7m_6-5-rgb_front good
13x0vemnm7m_7-5-rgb_front that is going to give her a little stability
13x0vemnm7m_8-5-rgb_front good
13x0vemnm7m_9-5-rgb_front and then she is going to lengthen that leg up to the sky
13_6cmohvvo_0-3-rgb_front today i will be showing you how to remove your old doorknob and replace it with a new one
13_6cmohvvo_1-3-rgb_front now the tools you will need for this project are a flat head screwdriver for removing the latch bolt strike plate and spindle and you want to make sure it is really thin so that it does not damage the side of your door for those of you who are particular about it
13_6cmohvvo_2-3-rgb_front a phillips screwdriver for removing the bolts on the doorknob and you do not have to have it but an electric drill would help because it can remove the bolts much faster than you would be able to with this
13_6cmohvvo_3-3-rgb_front now also of course you will need a new doorknob which can be any doorknob of your choice can have a lock on both sides a lock on one side and the doorknob should come with new hardware a new latch bolt and the strike plate and the spindle and any necessary collars to complete the installation
13hou2rmsf8_1-8-rgb_front when you trim your toenails your going to want to use a toenail clipper and coarse emery board
13hou2rmsf8_2-8-rgb_front i use a coarse one because the toenails are a lot thicker then your finger nails so you are going to want to use a coarse one on your toenails
13hou2rmsf8_3-8-rgb_front you simply start with the toenail clippers close it just comes it and you just flip it around and start trimming to your desire length
13hou2rmsf8_4-8-rgb_front after you have trim all these toenails to the length that you want them then you could get rid of the rough edges by simply shaping the nail
13hou2rmsf8_5-8-rgb_front to the shape that you want it
13hou2rmsf8_6-8-rgb_front usually when you get a french pedicure you usually leave the shape rather square if you just want really short toenails and no color or with color you could do them round and even a little bit shorter then you would if you where going to get a french pedicure
13hou2rmsf8_7-8-rgb_front that is completed and then we would just continue on and do the same thing on the other foot
13xhobkavim_0-8-rgb_front hello this is anthony
13xhobkavim_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to talk about renting photographic equipment
13xhobkavim_10-8-rgb_front and usually the day rate can be anywhere from dollars upwards to maybe even dollars for a piece of equipment
13xhobkavim_11-8-rgb_front the biggest part about renting something that is really detrimental to it is that you have to put down a deposit
13xhobkavim_12-8-rgb_front now no camera store owner in his right mind or her right mind is going to let you walk out of their camera store with a dollar camera without a credit card or a pretty large deposit
13xhobkavim_13-8-rgb_front so i know when i first started out i wanted to make sure that i had that much money on my credit card because they might charge you for that camera
13xhobkavim_14-8-rgb_front they might charge a few thousand dollars and then you will get that back on your credit card
13xhobkavim_15-8-rgb_front now if you are working on a budget this is something that you really have to take seriously because when you leave that camera store if you had that money on your credit card you might not have it when you leave and that is a mistake i have personally made and i have seen some other professionals make
13xhobkavim_2-8-rgb_front the one thing about renting equipment that is an excellent opportunity for any photographer being a professional or an amateur or someone just getting into it is that you do not have to purchase the equipment you are renting
13xhobkavim_3-8-rgb_front we all know that photography equipment is pretty expensive
13xhobkavim_4-8-rgb_front so by renting it you get a chance to see if you even like this equipment
13xhobkavim_5_6-8-rgb_front do you like this camera and you know i give i try to tip my students off to renting something before they buy it
13xhobkavim_7-8-rgb_front so in some ways that is actually going to going to work for you
13xhobkavim_8-8-rgb_front when you have to rent a camera for a job let is say you are a professional photographer or someone just starting out in the photography market you want to make sure that you call the camera store to make sure they have your piece of equipment
13xhobkavim_9-8-rgb_front most camera stores have a website where they list the equipment they have and then they list the rate for that equipment
13yrkj6yopq_0-8-rgb_front hello i am sifu mallon with the clearwater kung fu center
13yrkj6yopq_1-8-rgb_front this is my assistant melissa and this kickboxing
13yrkj6yopq_10-8-rgb_front so elbows are loose shoulders are relax right and chin dips forward slightly
13yrkj6yopq_11-8-rgb_front now from here she is going to advance forward with her left foot and throw a left jab out
13yrkj6yopq_12-8-rgb_front hold it there a few hold after you throw it out
13yrkj6yopq_13-8-rgb_front okay now if we are looking straight on to the target we want to actually bring our punch okay so that it is inside your shoulder range
13yrkj6yopq_14-8-rgb_front so if you look at the body as a triangle this way we are pointing punching toward the center of the body
13yrkj6yopq_15-8-rgb_front the forward leg if you are looking right the foot is flat and the weight is on the inside of the foot not allowing the weight go to the outside so that you are lifting your toe you are unstable at that point
13yrkj6yopq_16-8-rgb_front so weight on the inside
13yrkj6yopq_17-8-rgb_front if we are not punching anything especially in beginning phases we want to maintain your elbow okay in neutral
13yrkj6yopq_18-8-rgb_front this means we are not going to lock the elbow out when we throw the punch
13yrkj6yopq_19-8-rgb_front okay
13yrkj6yopq_2-8-rgb_front starting with our punching
13yrkj6yopq_20-8-rgb_front this is going to be straight but not lock
13yrkj6yopq_21-8-rgb_front so this is lock and that is what we want a little relax
13yrkj6yopq_22-8-rgb_front bring the hand back in
13yrkj6yopq_23-8-rgb_front and melissa go ahead and fire off a few repetitions of the jab
13yrkj6yopq_24-8-rgb_front good
13yrkj6yopq_25-8-rgb_front so this technique is called our straight jab kickboxing
13yrkj6yopq_3-8-rgb_front the punches okay we are going to be using okay our kickboxing punches
13yrkj6yopq_4-8-rgb_front so we have several different punches we will cover
13yrkj6yopq_5-8-rgb_front the first set is going to be our straight jab meaning if i have my left foot in front i am using my left hand okay and throwing a straight punch in front of the body
13yrkj6yopq_6-8-rgb_front i have melissa demonstrate this slow so i can point out some of the finer details of it
13yrkj6yopq_7-8-rgb_front so she begins from her stance both feet point the same general direction
13yrkj6yopq_8-8-rgb_front good
13yrkj6yopq_9-8-rgb_front our hands are up in our high guard position
14309wsfpwg_0-8-rgb_front alex boye hey
14309wsfpwg_1-8-rgb_front my name is alex boye
14309wsfpwg_10-8-rgb_front no
14309wsfpwg_11-8-rgb_front but let me tell you how many people try to impersonate him
14309wsfpwg_12-8-rgb_front song sounds got you sounds like i do not want to leave before indiscernible
14309wsfpwg_13-8-rgb_front are you kidding me
14309wsfpwg_14-8-rgb_front he has made millions of dollars
14309wsfpwg_15-8-rgb_front you know why
14309wsfpwg_16-8-rgb_front because he does not care
14309wsfpwg_17-8-rgb_front he does not care
14309wsfpwg_18-8-rgb_front it is his own interpretation of his own emotion
14309wsfpwg_19_20_21_22_23-8-rgb_front that is why now many people are oh man you are bad brother oh go ahead oh oh and he is got and you know michael jackson he looks is his name
14309wsfpwg_24-8-rgb_front man steven tyler
14309wsfpwg_25-8-rgb_front alex boye steven tyler
14309wsfpwg_26-8-rgb_front man yeah
14309wsfpwg_27-8-rgb_front alex boye he looks at him michael jackson oh you are bad brother
14309wsfpwg_28_29_30_31_32-8-rgb_front you are bad i love you can i do a duet with you why it is not because he can dance it is because he has so much confidence that he does not care and it makes it look like he is absolutely amazing as a dancer on stage
14309wsfpwg_3-8-rgb_front one of the biggest of the biggest ways you can gain stage presence i am going to tell you right now okay there is nothing else you need to know
14309wsfpwg_33-8-rgb_front so many people copy that
14309wsfpwg_34-8-rgb_front we are going to talk about a little bit more about that on the other side later
14309wsfpwg_4-8-rgb_front if you want someone to say that guy or that girl has amazing stage presence all you have to do is have confidence
14309wsfpwg_5-8-rgb_front i am telling you confidence hides a multitude of sins
14309wsfpwg_6-8-rgb_front if you sing off key and you are confident everyone thinks you are from bono
14309wsfpwg_7-8-rgb_front if if you can not dance good and you do it with confidence then they think you are that guy from aerosmith
14309wsfpwg_8-8-rgb_front am i right or am i wrong
14309wsfpwg_9-8-rgb_front can he dance
146hwl-ygto_1-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to be turning our bag right side out and making buttonholes along the two seams so we can use those to loop through our drawstring
146hwl-ygto_10-8-rgb_front in this case it is inch
146hwl-ygto_11-8-rgb_front go to the other seam and measure down inches
146hwl-ygto_12-8-rgb_front put in your pin and then another pin inch down from there
146hwl-ygto_13-8-rgb_front we are just doing a really small buttonhole because this rattail we are going to use to slip through is very thin
146hwl-ygto_14-8-rgb_front make sure they both measure up and i also like to fold them together
146hwl-ygto_15-8-rgb_front the measurement is off just a little bit and i will fix that
146hwl-ygto_16-8-rgb_front we are going to do a buttonhole
146hwl-ygto_17-8-rgb_front switch out to your buttonhole foot which looks like this
146hwl-ygto_18-8-rgb_front line up your fabric in the very center and to the top
146hwl-ygto_19-8-rgb_front put it on the first step of the botton hole
146hwl-ygto_2-8-rgb_front go ahead and turn your bag inside out
146hwl-ygto_20-8-rgb_front four step button holes will have a picture sometimes its arrow or sometimes its number or sometimes it is labled a b c d
146hwl-ygto_3-8-rgb_front at the very top you want to figure out where you want to put your botton holes
146hwl-ygto_4-8-rgb_front what we are going to be doing is folding the top over and making a little casing the ribbon will slip through
146hwl-ygto_5-8-rgb_front fold it over about of inch and turn to the right side of the bag
146hwl-ygto_6-8-rgb_front place a pin about inch down and then inch down from that pin is where we will be doing the button hole
146hwl-ygto_7-8-rgb_front make sure once you fold over for the casing you will not have anything sticking out
146hwl-ygto_8-8-rgb_front do the same thing on the other side
146hwl-ygto_9-8-rgb_front you can even measure how far done
14bl0ro5e-8_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is dean hale and today i am going to give you a general overview of how to play the american classic poker
14bl0ro5e-8_1-8-rgb_front now different people think of poker as different games
14bl0ro5e-8_10-8-rgb_front so it is two cards the same number and another two cards of the same number that is two pair
14bl0ro5e-8_11-8-rgb_front the next after that would be three of a kind or what some people call a set
14bl0ro5e-8_12-8-rgb_front a set would simply be three cards of the same number in your hand
14bl0ro5e-8_13-8-rgb_front after three of a kind would be a straight
14bl0ro5e-8_14-8-rgb_front a straight is any five cards in sequential order of different suits
14bl0ro5e-8_15-8-rgb_front after a straight you would have a flush
14bl0ro5e-8_16-8-rgb_front a flush is five cards of the same suit whether it be hearts diamonds spades or clubs in a order
14bl0ro5e-8_17-8-rgb_front after a flush the next highest hand value would be called a full house or what some poker players refer to as a boat
14bl0ro5e-8_18-8-rgb_front and that is simply three cards of the same number and then two cards of the same number
14bl0ro5e-8_19-8-rgb_front so for instance the best full house you could have would be three aces and two kings that would be called aces over kings
14bl0ro5e-8_2-8-rgb_front today texas hold em is probably the most popular game that people think of when they play poker
14bl0ro5e-8_20-8-rgb_front after a full house you would have four of a kind simply as it states you have four cards of the same number
14bl0ro5e-8_21-8-rgb_front the two hands that beat four of a kind would be a straight flush or a royal flush
14bl0ro5e-8_22-8-rgb_front a royal flush is ten jack queen king ace in order of the same suit and that is the best hand in poker
14bl0ro5e-8_23-8-rgb_front my name is dean hale and i just taught you the basics on how to play poker
14bl0ro5e-8_3-8-rgb_front but there are games that have stood the test of time such as five card draw five card stud omaha seven card stud omaha hi lo the list goes on and on
14bl0ro5e-8_4-8-rgb_front the essential thing you need to know to learn how to play poker is the starting value of each hand
14bl0ro5e-8_5-8-rgb_front the starting value ranges from high card all the way to a royal flush and then there is the rankings in between
14bl0ro5e-8_6-8-rgb_front high card is simply as it states ace when you consider high card is listed as a high card
14bl0ro5e-8_7-8-rgb_front the next ranking would be a pair that would be any two cards that are of the same number
14bl0ro5e-8_8-8-rgb_front the next ranking after that would be two pair that would be two cards or four cards that have the same numerical value of the other one
14bl0ro5e-8_9-8-rgb_front so i may have made that a little confusing let is just say if you have two threes and two nines that would be two pair
14pag7riask_0-8-rgb_front let is go over the rainbow chest move
14pag7riask_1-8-rgb_front this movement will combine both the torso slide and the chest lift
14pag7riask_10-8-rgb_front be sure to keep your belly button engage to your spine and not arching your back
14pag7riask_11-8-rgb_front let is try it with some music
14pag7riask_12-8-rgb_front five six seven eight
14pag7riask_13-8-rgb_front let is try doing that in the mirror at home
14pag7riask_2-8-rgb_front make sure your feet are parallel your knees are slightly bent your belly button is pulled in towards your spine your chest is lifted shoulders are relaxed and down
14pag7riask_3-8-rgb_front arms are out to the side
14pag7riask_4-8-rgb_front let is begin by first sliding the chest to the side
14pag7riask_5-8-rgb_front go to your full range of motion
14pag7riask_6-8-rgb_front now we are going to lift the chest and then bring it across to the other side and letting it release
14pag7riask_7-8-rgb_front let is go back the other direction up and over
14pag7riask_8-8-rgb_front so that way you think about having a nice little rainbow
14pag7riask_9-8-rgb_front so again go from side to side
14patn6qnsq_0-8-rgb_front alright you want to check to see if it is on center here is a little way to do it
14patn6qnsq_1-8-rgb_front take a steady hand rest it on your wheel or your leg or whatever and just put it right up next to your piece
14patn6qnsq_2-8-rgb_front it will it will tell you if it is true or not and it is true
14patn6qnsq_3-8-rgb_front it is centered
14patn6qnsq_4-8-rgb_front so we are going to flatten the top and maybe you can do this since we are going big clean up the wheel head
14patn6qnsq_5-8-rgb_front it will leave you with a more relaxed mind and you will focus on the pot
14patn6qnsq_6-8-rgb_front it is going to start boring it down like that
14patn6qnsq_7-8-rgb_front then we are going to start taking our thumbs and we are going to drill them down into the pot and we are going to go out with it
14uhnrrd3gm_0-8-rgb_front riding backwards or riding fakie is another very basic step in learning bmx freestyle tricks
14uhnrrd3gm_1-8-rgb_front for me it is one of the things that i enjoy the most about riding although it is very perplexing to a lot of people you know it is just not a very natural motion especially once you spent so many years learning how to ride a bike forward
14uhnrrd3gm_2-8-rgb_front a lot of people just do not understand the whole concept of riding backwards and there is a couple of things you should keep in mind when you are doing that
14uhnrrd3gm_3-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that your weight distribution is center and you also want to make sure that you keep in mind that essentially when you are rolling backwards all of sudden your bike is stirring very differently because rather then stirring from the front and having the front wheel lead in the back wheel around all of sudden you are steering from essentially your back wheel
14uhnrrd3gm_4-8-rgb_front so as you turn you are not only turning basically the opposite of the way that you do when you rolling forward but any sort of motion that come through the front end is going to effect the way that your bike turns much faster
14uhnrrd3gm_5-8-rgb_front for example if you watch and you are rolling if you turn your bike turns very gently where if you are riding backwards you do that and all of sudden your bike is sideways and you have to make sure that you are not making any sudden movements and that you have a nice center weight distribution over the bike
14uhnrrd3gm_6-8-rgb_front basically riding fakie is one of the most necessary tricks or i guess types of maneuvers that you can learn how to bmx bike
14uhnrrd3gm_7-8-rgb_front once you have fakie skills mastered it opens up a whole new roam of tricks that you can start experimenting with
14uhnrrd3gm_8-8-rgb_front here i will show you how it works right no
14zyg0hu6g8_0-8-rgb_front for tiffany is hair i had to her hair for hair color and that is the case for any hair color in order to achieve the best results
14zyg0hu6g8_1-8-rgb_front you want to use a deep clarifying shampoo and make sure it says clarifying shampoo
14zyg0hu6g8_10-8-rgb_front so she is not going to have extra light spots extra dark spots
14zyg0hu6g8_11-8-rgb_front it is evened the porosity of her hair and will make her hair ready for hair color
14zyg0hu6g8_12-8-rgb_front so tiffany will have beautiful highlights when we are done
14zyg0hu6g8_2-8-rgb_front that gets rid of any residue that might be in the hair
14zyg0hu6g8_3-8-rgb_front any styling products any hairspray buildup and sometimes there is a conditioner buildup
14zyg0hu6g8_4-8-rgb_front that will keep your hair from coloring properly if you do not use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of that
14zyg0hu6g8_5-8-rgb_front then the next process that i did was a deep conditioner a protein anything any conditioner that says protein on it
14zyg0hu6g8_6-8-rgb_front you want to use a protein based conditioner
14zyg0hu6g8_7-8-rgb_front which is a very thick conditioner that will help fill in any dry areas of her hair
14zyg0hu6g8_8-8-rgb_front so her hair color processes properly
14zyg0hu6g8_9-8-rgb_front so i have her hair for hair color so we can get the best results from her highlights
14_gpqyx36s_0-8-rgb_front and then after you have prepared your tape grid the next step you want to do is add some greenery to cover up your mechanics and add prepare a foundation for your arrangement
14_gpqyx36s_1-8-rgb_front so you want to cut the greenery and tuck it in between the grid holes like this
14_gpqyx36s_10-8-rgb_front again cutting your stems before you put them down into the water
14_gpqyx36s_11-8-rgb_front cut the stems place it in
14_gpqyx36s_12-8-rgb_front and you just want to create your hydrangeas are going to be up here so you just want to create a good foundation
14_gpqyx36s_13-8-rgb_front and hold them securely in the bowl between the grid and your greenery
14_gpqyx36s_14-8-rgb_front so we are just going to put a few more pieces in like this and we are going to go around in a circular fashion like that
14_gpqyx36s_15-8-rgb_front and tuck it in tightly and securely
14_gpqyx36s_16-8-rgb_front and this is how we prepare the greenery
14_gpqyx36s_17-8-rgb_front put it in
14_gpqyx36s_18-8-rgb_front and next step will be the hydrangeas
14_gpqyx36s_19-8-rgb_front just like that
14_gpqyx36s_2-8-rgb_front and you can add this is leather leaf
14_gpqyx36s_20-8-rgb_front that is how you green your vase for the hydrangeas
14_gpqyx36s_3-8-rgb_front just tick it in like that
14_gpqyx36s_4-8-rgb_front make sure it is getting down into the water
14_gpqyx36s_5-8-rgb_front and you are going to put a couple of pieces it does not have to be completely full
14_gpqyx36s_6-8-rgb_front and this is how you edge your greenery
14_gpqyx36s_7-8-rgb_front just like that
14_gpqyx36s_8-8-rgb_front and then we will take this is lemon leaves
14_gpqyx36s_9-8-rgb_front it will add a different texture and a fullness
14ftpepnw6s_0-8-rgb_front okay as you can see i am totally out of position for pose fifteen
14ftpepnw6s_1-8-rgb_front so i am going to take you back to thirteen and get you back into the pose so we can add a hand to this
14ftpepnw6s_10-8-rgb_front pants are really fun to model because the longer the leg and most print models have nice long legs you really get to show off the pant leg
14ftpepnw6s_11-8-rgb_front we want to show the flare if it is narrow at the bottom or flared at the bottom
14ftpepnw6s_12-8-rgb_front we also want to show any designs that are on the pant
14ftpepnw6s_13-8-rgb_front so in pose fifteen you can show the sleeves and the pants particularly well with a very broad pose
14ftpepnw6s_2-8-rgb_front i am going to point my left toe straight ahead with a straight leg and get my right leg positioned in a ninety degree angle
14ftpepnw6s_3-8-rgb_front the right heel is just to the back of the right the left heel so that it creates this ninety degree angle
14ftpepnw6s_4-8-rgb_front the right toe is pointed straight out to the side
14ftpepnw6s_5-8-rgb_front in pose fourteen we added one hand
14ftpepnw6s_6-8-rgb_front in pose fifteen we are going to add two hands
14ftpepnw6s_7-8-rgb_front so bring both hands up to the hip
14ftpepnw6s_8-8-rgb_front again keep your focus into camera and notice that the body is totally broad to narrow by adding two elbows up
14ftpepnw6s_9-8-rgb_front and i have a wide view of the clothing that i am wearing particularly pants
14fs-ot5kcc_1-8-rgb_front after you have mastered your you are able to start moving on into more advanced tumbling
14fs-ot5kcc_10-8-rgb_front so it is really important your spotters are going to be behind you we are going to end up going completely back and landing on the palms of our hands
14fs-ot5kcc_11-8-rgb_front make sure you can keep your arms straight and you want to do a little shrug at the shoulder and then you are going to pop out of it similarly to how you would pop out of a handstand
14fs-ot5kcc_12-8-rgb_front now it is also important to learn once you have mastered your back handspring the second high level skill is going to be your tuck
14fs-ot5kcc_13-8-rgb_front now first you need to master your tuck jump which is going to be this position here knees high up on the chest
14fs-ot5kcc_14-8-rgb_front and a tuck jump is basically going to be this form with both your knees hugged tightly to your chest in the air
14fs-ot5kcc_15-8-rgb_front you can do a running tuck which is going to be attached to your or your handspring or you can do a standing still tuck which is going to be a different prep from our handspring
14fs-ot5kcc_16-8-rgb_front we are going to start stationary
14fs-ot5kcc_17-8-rgb_front we are going to get up on our toes to get some momentum and we are going to go straight in
14fs-ot5kcc_18-8-rgb_front it is really important to ride your jump up when you are doing a tuck
14fs-ot5kcc_19-8-rgb_front you really need to pull yourself all the way to the tippy top before you go into the tuck position
14fs-ot5kcc_2-8-rgb_front now advanced tumbling is most easily done in combination from a because you are going to get a lot of momentum
14fs-ot5kcc_20-8-rgb_front you want to hold that position tightly until you spin all the way around
14fs-ot5kcc_21-8-rgb_front now a lot of us when we are landing our tucks you are going to be in this position down here on the floor a lot when you land your tucks
14fs-ot5kcc_22-8-rgb_front that is ok you are still learning just get up out of if and get a spot until you can make that full rotation
14fs-ot5kcc_23-8-rgb_front another tumble which is really advanced is called a layout
14fs-ot5kcc_24-8-rgb_front a layout is going to be a flip that is similar to a tuck where your hands never make contact to the ground
14fs-ot5kcc_25-8-rgb_front in the air your layout position is basically going to be this
14fs-ot5kcc_26-8-rgb_front we are going to do a full rotation in a flat position like this
14fs-ot5kcc_27-8-rgb_front after you have mastered your layout you can start doing fulls which are the most fun tumbling
14fs-ot5kcc_28-8-rgb_front a full is going to be a layout in this position with a full rotation in the air
14fs-ot5kcc_29-8-rgb_front those are the most difficult of tumbling passages
14fs-ot5kcc_3-8-rgb_front demonstrated right here are the steps that you are going to take in a back handspring
14fs-ot5kcc_30-8-rgb_front a good way to master those is using trampolines
14fs-ot5kcc_31-8-rgb_front you can use foam pits and also definitely use lots of mats
14fs-ot5kcc_4-8-rgb_front i highly recommend starting out with spotters
14fs-ot5kcc_5-8-rgb_front this is going to be the best way to learn the movements in slow motion then you can go ahead and take it from there
14fs-ot5kcc_6-8-rgb_front now we can also do all of these tumbles which we are going to call standing format instead of running which is linked onto the
14fs-ot5kcc_7-8-rgb_front now it is important when you are learning your back handspring to have tons of matted floors
14fs-ot5kcc_8-8-rgb_front these are going to be provided by your facility when you are tumbling
14fs-ot5kcc_9-8-rgb_front now the correct position to start off with a back hand spring you are going to want to bend at the knees and rock back on your heels as you take off
14hq4hrjwlc_0-8-rgb_front hi i am tim gipson and i am going to talk to you about how to measure windows
14hq4hrjwlc_1-8-rgb_front now window size is based on the finished opening that we have around the windows
14hq4hrjwlc_10-8-rgb_front so from the top finished opening of the window to the sill gives me my height of the window
14hq4hrjwlc_11-8-rgb_front so in this case as i have measured i have got a thirty one by seventy inch window
14hq4hrjwlc_12-8-rgb_front and how that is useful is draw a rectangle
14hq4hrjwlc_13-8-rgb_front put those dimensions down
14hq4hrjwlc_14-8-rgb_front so now if you are constructing a valance or you are putting curtains up or measuring for curtains then you have your good measurements for you windows as far as how many panels you will need or what size you will need for blinds
14hq4hrjwlc_15-8-rgb_front i am tim gipson and that is how to measure a window
14hq4hrjwlc_2-8-rgb_front so in this case these windows have finished drywall and so the width would be from one finished side to the other
14hq4hrjwlc_3-8-rgb_front so to measure that simply put my tape measure flush to one side and measure over to the other side and i get thirty one inches
14hq4hrjwlc_4-8-rgb_front so just by measuring flush side to flush side i get thirty one inches
14hq4hrjwlc_5-8-rgb_front so my window is thirty one inches high
14hq4hrjwlc_6-8-rgb_front now the same thing on the height of the window
14hq4hrjwlc_7-8-rgb_front now the height we can not see because it is up inside this valance but there will be a top finished surface just like this drywall finish up inside
14hq4hrjwlc_8-8-rgb_front so i can insert my tape measure up to that width and then i what i want to do is i want to measure down to the sill down at the bottom
14hq4hrjwlc_9-8-rgb_front in this case i get seventy inches
14i542df6ps_0-8-rgb_front hi i am gretchen rivas with relax to the max massage therapy and today we are going to be talking about how to give a massage
14i542df6ps_1-8-rgb_front when you are working with someone and you want to give them a massage what you want to do is oil their back up first and i have already done that
14i542df6ps_2-8-rgb_front we do not really need to add a whole lot
14i542df6ps_3-8-rgb_front you do not want to put so much oil on someone when you are giving a massage that they are like sliding around in oil and grease so just enough to give you some nice glide is all you need and then just do some nice soothing strokes choppy short strokes are not always the most comfortable or feel the best
14i542df6ps_4-8-rgb_front you want to do long gliding strokes to make the person feel connected and then some nice other massage strokes that feel good are those that go against the muscle fiber called cross fiber friction and since most of the muscles in the back run this way what you would like to do is go across and the opposite way and that really feels good and helps loosen up the muscle fibers and release tension and stress in the person
14i542df6ps_5-8-rgb_front you can work in the shoulder area through here around the shoulder blades and come up through the neck and you can do this on any part of the body this long stroking and soothing strokes down on the arms and also when you get to the leg area you can do that too
14i542df6ps_6-8-rgb_front the main thing you want to be careful of is not to rub on the bone
14i542df6ps_7-8-rgb_front you want to avoid the bony prominences on the body work on the muscle tissues and ask for feedback from the person you are working on so that way if you are new to this and you are just playing around with a friend and just trying to give a massage and not professionally trained have them give you feedback on how you are doing and if you are rubbing on anything that is painful
14i542df6ps_8-8-rgb_front you want to be careful about that
14i542df6ps_9-8-rgb_front just go nice and slow and stroke through the areas that need it and that is how you give a massage
14klv5a4_rg_0-8-rgb_front now i have taken all four of my side walls and i have flipped them onto their backside so that the leaves are facing the bottom here
14klv5a4_rg_1-8-rgb_front and they are all facing the same direction where the slits are all at the same side
14klv5a4_rg_10-8-rgb_front so then you do it on the top edge and then also on the side edge of the same piece
14klv5a4_rg_11-8-rgb_front get them really well scored and slipped
14klv5a4_rg_12-8-rgb_front the gooier they are the better they are going to stick together
14klv5a4_rg_13-8-rgb_front so you are going to need to do that to all four pieces before you move on to putting it together
14klv5a4_rg_2-8-rgb_front so now i am going to moisten the top edge of one piece
14klv5a4_rg_3-8-rgb_front and taking my scoring tool which has multiple needles
14klv5a4_rg_4-8-rgb_front you can use a regular needle tool you are just going to have to do a lot more scratching
14klv5a4_rg_5-8-rgb_front so it is really nice to have one of these
14klv5a4_rg_6-8-rgb_front make some cuts and them take your slip again and just put a little layer of that on there
14klv5a4_rg_7-8-rgb_front it is going to act a little bit as a glue
14klv5a4_rg_8-8-rgb_front it is going to help bond these pieces together because they are leather hard
14klv5a4_rg_9-8-rgb_front so they do need a little bit of extra moisture and do that
14vf1lpqcgc_0-8-rgb_front okay now we are going to add some scallops
14vf1lpqcgc_1-8-rgb_front we are going to come back about halfway
14vf1lpqcgc_10-8-rgb_front okay and then just pull it off of the beads
14vf1lpqcgc_11-8-rgb_front okay and now we will come to our next marked off point
14vf1lpqcgc_12-8-rgb_front okay you want to go in and out like this
14vf1lpqcgc_13-8-rgb_front okay and now you have got a little crisscrossed swag going on
14vf1lpqcgc_14-8-rgb_front it is very pretty
14vf1lpqcgc_15-8-rgb_front okay and we will do one more
14vf1lpqcgc_16-8-rgb_front i am going to secure this beads here and measure it off
14vf1lpqcgc_17-8-rgb_front it has got just the right amount of beads on it
14vf1lpqcgc_18-8-rgb_front and slide your needle very slowly and you kind of watch the beads as the needle goes through
14vf1lpqcgc_19-8-rgb_front you can see it enter each of the beads
14vf1lpqcgc_2-8-rgb_front you can mark the halfway point between each of the scallops that you have with some pins
14vf1lpqcgc_20-8-rgb_front if you see the needle come out at the side then you want to pull back and redo it
14vf1lpqcgc_21-8-rgb_front let me cut the knot off of the beads and pull that up and go to our next marked off section
14vf1lpqcgc_22-8-rgb_front and you will just continue that to the end and we will secure each scallop as we go
14vf1lpqcgc_23-8-rgb_front okay now when you get to the point where your thread is about twice the length of your needle you want to stop
14vf1lpqcgc_24-8-rgb_front do not be tempted to continue to bead till you are too close to the needle because you need room to make your knot
14vf1lpqcgc_25-8-rgb_front so to make the knot we want to just come up through the fabric a little bit
14vf1lpqcgc_26-8-rgb_front grab a little bit of fabric
14vf1lpqcgc_27-8-rgb_front you make a loop
14vf1lpqcgc_28-8-rgb_front you put your needle through the loop and hold the next loop while you pull down the first loop
14vf1lpqcgc_29-8-rgb_front and then put your needle again through the loop and pull that down and pull the whole thing taut
14vf1lpqcgc_3-8-rgb_front and then we are going to come back
14vf1lpqcgc_30-8-rgb_front that should make a good secure knot
14vf1lpqcgc_31-8-rgb_front and you can cut off close to the knot
14vf1lpqcgc_4-8-rgb_front so you just slide your needle through along the seam and come out at your marked point
14vf1lpqcgc_5-8-rgb_front and again we will measure off with our paper the amount of beads that we want for our scallop
14vf1lpqcgc_6-8-rgb_front okay
14vf1lpqcgc_7-8-rgb_front and hold that taut and just slide the needle through the beads
14vf1lpqcgc_8-8-rgb_front when you hold the string nice and taut the needle will go right through easily
14vf1lpqcgc_9-8-rgb_front okay you pull
14weiyqswle_0-8-rgb_front hi i am emily larew continuing on with our intermediate hip hop combination

14z8c3qqv0e_0-8-rgb_front hi
14z8c3qqv0e_10-8-rgb_front you might want to test it just to make sure that it is not loose
14z8c3qqv0e_11-8-rgb_front additionally it is always a good idea to test it one more time
14z8c3qqv0e_2-8-rgb_front in this video clip i will be showing you the final step in installing a smoke detector
14z8c3qqv0e_3-8-rgb_front next we need to install our battery
14z8c3qqv0e_4-8-rgb_front you want to make sure you get the positive side to the positive side and negative side to the negative side
14z8c3qqv0e_5-8-rgb_front go and close the battery compartment
14z8c3qqv0e_6-8-rgb_front at this point i like to test the smoke alarm while it is still on the ground
14z8c3qqv0e_7-8-rgb_front i would hate to put it up in the ceiling and just to find out that it does not work because i would have to get back up there and take it down so it is much easier to test it on the ground
14z8c3qqv0e_8-8-rgb_front everything seems to be working properly
14z8c3qqv0e_9-8-rgb_front to install our smoke detector on to our base we simply put it in place and rotate it clockwise until it snaps in place
15-lma3_mq4_0-8-rgb_front hi
15-lma3_mq4_1-8-rgb_front i am back with my expert anne who is a reflexologist and i am just about to begin soaking my feet in this bowl of hot water
15-lma3_mq4_10-8-rgb_front working on reflexology for more than an hour is usually a bit too much for your lymphatic and your circulatory systems
15-lma3_mq4_11-8-rgb_front there will normally be a soak to soften your feet and to sort of get the blood flowing first and then feet will be cleaned and scrubbed and then they will be dried off and we will go to work on your feet
15-lma3_mq4_12-8-rgb_front because there is no gliding or sliding along larger muscles reflexology does not require any lotion or oils
15-lma3_mq4_13-8-rgb_front it is a nice quick sort of more convenient massage
15-lma3_mq4_2-8-rgb_front anne what can we expect when we come to reflexologist
15-lma3_mq4_3-8-rgb_front typically what happens
15-lma3_mq4_4-8-rgb_front well if you go to a spa for reflexology massage it is a little bit different than going into a room and laying on a table and getting a full shiatsu or swedish massage
15-lma3_mq4_5-8-rgb_front you will be normally fully clothed because you are just dealing with the feet and the hands and the lower legs
15-lma3_mq4_6-8-rgb_front you will be normally sitting up right
15-lma3_mq4_7-8-rgb_front it is kind of a great way to learn about massage because you are facing the massage therapist so you are able to actually talk to them about what specific pressure points do and where the pressure points are related in your body so you are able to get a much clearer idea specifically step by step what massage can offer you
15-lma3_mq4_8-8-rgb_front how long does it take
15-lma3_mq4_9-8-rgb_front normally a full reflexology treatment takes between half an hour and an hour
157gubmm-yc_0-8-rgb_front did you know that using certain types of oil additives with synthetic lubricants or synthetic oils could actually be detrimental to your engine is performance
157gubmm-yc_1-8-rgb_front hi my name is jeff jannett i am a harley davidson certified master technician and today we will be discussing oil additives
157gubmm-yc_10-8-rgb_front the mobil synthetic they can say you can void the warranty on the motorcycle if you use an additive with a synthetic
157gubmm-yc_11-8-rgb_front again my name is jeff jannett harley davidson master technician and if you have any further questions about harley davidson oil additives feel free to browse the web
157gubmm-yc_12-8-rgb_front there are numerous articles on it and a lot of information out there
157gubmm-yc_13-8-rgb_front but any further questions talk to your local tech
157gubmm-yc_14-8-rgb_front they can be more than happy to help you
157gubmm-yc_2-8-rgb_front a lot of technicians in the industry i have been in the industry for ten years we all believe never met one that would disagree with me that oil additives are not necessary especially for air cooled v twin motorcycles
157gubmm-yc_3-8-rgb_front a lot of the programs that you see that tout their product products that are actually manufactured not going to name a lot of names but they throw you out some great infomercials yeah great lot of testimonials and so forth
157gubmm-yc_4-8-rgb_front but if you notice a lot of the test beds they are using are automobiles trucks diesels
157gubmm-yc_5-8-rgb_front air cooled v twin motorcycles if you follow the maintenance schedule if you change your oil regularly if you use a synthetic oil you will do just fine without any additional oil additives
157gubmm-yc_6-8-rgb_front air cooled vtwin motorcycles specifically in hot states i would recommend running synthetic oils
157gubmm-yc_7-8-rgb_front there is several on the market amsoil synthetic harley davidson synthetic motor oil
157gubmm-yc_8-8-rgb_front most of these are all designed for the air cooled v twin motorcycles
157gubmm-yc_9-8-rgb_front again additives i would not recommend the additives on an air cooled v twin motorcycle for the simple fact that you can actually cause more damage and harm and in some cases specifically with some brands ie
15hbvwqp1qw_0-5-rgb_front and what i am going to do also jr is i am going to apply a papaya and pineapple enzyme peel onto your skin
15hbvwqp1qw_1-5-rgb_front i am just going to warm it up a little bit before i put it on
15hbvwqp1qw_10-5-rgb_front actually steam is very good for oily skin
15hbvwqp1qw_11-5-rgb_front it also helps to cleanse the skin and soften it and it helps anything that you have that is clogging the pores to come out
15hbvwqp1qw_12-5-rgb_front so someone who has acne skin steam is good for it as well because that is obviously problems with maybe pores that are clogged or just hormones and things like that so it will help the product to take deeper into the skin
15hbvwqp1qw_13-5-rgb_front that is correct
15hbvwqp1qw_14-5-rgb_front that is correct
15hbvwqp1qw_15-5-rgb_front yes
15hbvwqp1qw_16-5-rgb_front you want to you want to be careful with acne skin though because you you want you want to cleanse it and you want to put the right products on there
15hbvwqp1qw_17-5-rgb_front a lot of people think that if you have acne prone skin that you can not use any moisturizer
15hbvwqp1qw_18-5-rgb_front moisturizers are fine for acne prone skin
15hbvwqp1qw_19-5-rgb_front what they do is they really help to balance the ph of the skin and by doing that you are allowing the skin to produce the proper amount of oil
15hbvwqp1qw_2-5-rgb_front i do not want to shock you with a cold product
15hbvwqp1qw_20-5-rgb_front sometimes if it is dried out too much it is going to produce more oils naturally and as a result tend to be even oilier than if you had not used a moisturizer
15hbvwqp1qw_21-5-rgb_front exactly
15hbvwqp1qw_3-5-rgb_front now with steam can people at home do their own steam like i always see women with a pot over their head leaning down with a towel over the pot
15hbvwqp1qw_4-5-rgb_front oh sure yeah you can steam your own skin at home
15hbvwqp1qw_5-5-rgb_front it is fine
15hbvwqp1qw_6-5-rgb_front it opens the pores
15hbvwqp1qw_7-5-rgb_front it makes it easier to clean the skin and it also it also helps to make it and it really helps with perspiration as well
15hbvwqp1qw_8-5-rgb_front so it cleans the skin out and you just want to make sure that you do a good cleanse before you steam
15hbvwqp1qw_9-5-rgb_front is it good for people with oily skin
15xtbrrgldy_0-8-rgb_front welcome to sedona spa
15xtbrrgldy_1-8-rgb_front we are going to be doing an acne treatment today
15xtbrrgldy_10-8-rgb_front we are first going to start with a cleansing treatment
15xtbrrgldy_11-8-rgb_front we are going to do two cleansing treatments and a deep exfoliation and then we are going to start again into the process of the softening gel enzyme and we are going to steam and open up those pores for a cleaning
15xtbrrgldy_12-8-rgb_front alright take a nice deep breath
15xtbrrgldy_13-8-rgb_front our steam is just about ready and we will be turning that off
15xtbrrgldy_14-8-rgb_front and there it is ready to go
15xtbrrgldy_15-8-rgb_front alright take a nice deep breath for me again
15xtbrrgldy_2-8-rgb_front we are going to be doing some very deep cleaning on our client and make sure that we really clear the skin out for her
15xtbrrgldy_3-8-rgb_front so that her skin really starts to come up to more of a normal base
15xtbrrgldy_4-8-rgb_front we are going to start with a little aroma therapy and start her breathing into the aroma therapy so that she can get used to my hands being on her
15xtbrrgldy_5_6_7_8-8-rgb_front sarina take a deep breath again ok we have got some steam going we are going to use our steam you can hear the noise in the room
15xtbrrgldy_9-8-rgb_front we are going to use our steam along with the softening gel and the product that is an enzyme to help open the pores
15byobr7bws_0-8-rgb_front hello
15byobr7bws_1-8-rgb_front my name is grady johnson and i am a professional painter
15byobr7bws_10-8-rgb_front now on this job it is not really peeling bad
15byobr7bws_11-8-rgb_front it does not get a lot of sunlight so it is not too bad
15byobr7bws_12-8-rgb_front if you have got a lot of heavy chalking or a lot of peeling then you want a really really strong gas powered pressure washer
15byobr7bws_13-8-rgb_front but on something lite like this i just used my standard electric pressure washer
15byobr7bws_14-8-rgb_front this is only about twelve hundred psi
15byobr7bws_15-8-rgb_front there is not a lot to it
15byobr7bws_16-8-rgb_front so it does not have as much strength as a big one
15byobr7bws_17-8-rgb_front but it is not going to need as much because mostly we are just going to get the dirt off
15byobr7bws_18-8-rgb_front we are going to take out these old cobwebs that are up in the eaves that kind of thing
15byobr7bws_19-8-rgb_front this is why today we are going to go ahead and use this standard old electric pressure washer
15byobr7bws_20-8-rgb_front now these are really easy to turn on
15byobr7bws_21-8-rgb_front it is just a button in the back back here
15byobr7bws_22-8-rgb_front push the button and you are going to hear it whir up
15byobr7bws_23-8-rgb_front that means the pressure is good
15byobr7bws_24-8-rgb_front then you just kind of want to test it and pull the trigger
15byobr7bws_25-8-rgb_front now you can see that is already set to about fifteen degrees
15byobr7bws_26-8-rgb_front that is going to be about what i normally work with
15byobr7bws_27-8-rgb_front that is why it is kind of sucky
15byobr7bws_28-8-rgb_front now that is enough to clean the i n
15byobr7bws_29-8-rgb_front it still has pretty good pressure
15byobr7bws_3-8-rgb_front now we are going to talk a little bit about pressure washing
15byobr7bws_30-8-rgb_front this pressure washer is only about twelve hundred psi
15byobr7bws_31-8-rgb_front that is pounds per square inch
15byobr7bws_32-8-rgb_front now when we are working we are hoping we are not going to find many rough areas
15byobr7bws_33-8-rgb_front that is why we are using an electric
15byobr7bws_34-8-rgb_front because mostly we are just washing
15byobr7bws_35-8-rgb_front but if we have found a rough area we want to go ahead and go to this tip turn it all the way to the left side and you are going to get that needle nose
15byobr7bws_36-8-rgb_front that has the maximum pressure on the pressure washer
15byobr7bws_37-8-rgb_front dig out any area that you have even if you have a stubborn cobweb that is up in a corner
15byobr7bws_38-8-rgb_front but normally you are going to keep that at about fifteen
15byobr7bws_39-8-rgb_front now that is just a matter of turning the wand tip
15byobr7bws_4-8-rgb_front the reason we are talking about pressure washing is it is crucial to pressure wash the exterior of your house before you do any painting
15byobr7bws_40-8-rgb_front that is about right
15byobr7bws_41-8-rgb_front now you are going to go ahead and get that up into the eaves and we want to get the back side as well
15byobr7bws_42-8-rgb_front then you want to go ahead and get the reverse side too
15byobr7bws_43-8-rgb_front you see this is a pretty good paint job
15byobr7bws_44-8-rgb_front it is holding on pretty good
15byobr7bws_45-8-rgb_front now i am going to bring my facing on down
15byobr7bws_46-8-rgb_front i will work my way down the eaves that way
15byobr7bws_47-8-rgb_front now once i have got to a point that i like i want to go ahead and get the rest of this section here while i am here instead of making a lot of moves
15byobr7bws_48-8-rgb_front so i am going to need to get a little higher to get these jalous eaves
15byobr7bws_49-8-rgb_front so i kind of keep a ladder handy
15byobr7bws_5-8-rgb_front it is not that you can not paint without pressure washing
15byobr7bws_50-8-rgb_front i am going to pull that in now
15byobr7bws_51-8-rgb_front pull that into place and jump up a couple of rungs
15byobr7bws_52-8-rgb_front now once i am up here i can shoot down on it
15byobr7bws_53-8-rgb_front that way it will work like rainwater
15byobr7bws_54-8-rgb_front this is where you really wash down all that grime
15byobr7bws_55-8-rgb_front it is a nice opportunity to get these sills too
15byobr7bws_56-8-rgb_front now all that is left is this bottom part on the wall
15byobr7bws_57-8-rgb_front we will bring that on up and keep continuing on down
15byobr7bws_58-8-rgb_front this is how you pressure wash the exterior surface of a house to prepare it for painting
15byobr7bws_6-8-rgb_front it is just that the paint is not going to stick as well as it will adhere to a cleaner surface
15byobr7bws_7-8-rgb_front now with pressure washers there is a couple of kinds you can get
15byobr7bws_8-8-rgb_front you can get the gas powered ones which are the best and the strongest
15byobr7bws_9-8-rgb_front or you can get something like i am using today an electric pressure washer
15h_ez8ggvy_0-8-rgb_front in the next area what we are going to talk about is the mouthpieces
15h_ez8ggvy_1-8-rgb_front one of the requirements for usa boxing for competition is to actually have a form fitted mouthpiece
15h_ez8ggvy_10-8-rgb_front and you are not getting the full capacity of a good mouthpiece by trying to cut down a adult one into a youth size
15h_ez8ggvy_11-8-rgb_front so make sure you have a good assortment of those
15h_ez8ggvy_12-8-rgb_front what we like to do is we just take a cup of water and throw it in a microwave for two and a half minutes
15h_ez8ggvy_13-8-rgb_front we do not actually boil the mouthpiece itself
15h_ez8ggvy_14-8-rgb_front we will take a cup of boiled water we will drop the mouthpiece in there for about twenty seconds
15h_ez8ggvy_15-8-rgb_front and then pour that into the sink
15h_ez8ggvy_16-8-rgb_front the boxer takes the mouthpiece out of the sink just shakes it a bit to get the excess water out of there and slides it in his mouth
15h_ez8ggvy_17-8-rgb_front and what i have them do is once it is in their mouth i have them push down on the sides
15h_ez8ggvy_18-8-rgb_front and then suck really hard and then bite so they are bottom teeth and bottom teeth both make an indentation in there
15h_ez8ggvy_19-8-rgb_front and hold it for about a minute
15h_ez8ggvy_2-8-rgb_front the old rubber mouthpieces that you just insert and use temporarily like maybe in a gym in a sparring match or if the boxer forgets his mouthpiece
15h_ez8ggvy_20-8-rgb_front and then once you take it out run it under cold water
15h_ez8ggvy_21-8-rgb_front hopefully what you are going to end up with is a good form fitted mouthpiece that fits you and only you
15h_ez8ggvy_22-8-rgb_front and is not able to fall out once you are in the ring
15h_ez8ggvy_3-8-rgb_front what we like to do here is we have an area set aside with little ziploc bags with the boxer is name on them so they can leave their mouthpieces right here in the gym
15h_ez8ggvy_4-8-rgb_front so they are not using the excuse i forgot my mouthpiece at home
15h_ez8ggvy_5-8-rgb_front we always try to have everybody working out in the gym with their mouthpieces whether they are jump roping or working on the heavy bag or the speed bag
15h_ez8ggvy_6-8-rgb_front especially of course sparring
15h_ez8ggvy_7-8-rgb_front but just working out with your mouthpiece gives you a chance to get used to it as well
15h_ez8ggvy_8-8-rgb_front the only thing to remember is always have an assortment of youth mouthpieces and the adult
15h_ez8ggvy_9-8-rgb_front what happens is if you try to cut down in adult to fit a youth you are missing a lot of the finer point
15sml7bhh5s_0-8-rgb_front hi i am gretchen rivas with relax to the max massage therapy
15sml7bhh5s_1-8-rgb_front and today we are going to talk about how to find a massage therapist
15sml7bhh5s_10-8-rgb_front and so this is how you would look and find a massage therapist
15sml7bhh5s_2-8-rgb_front if you are in town visiting one of the things you can do is you can look or you can also look in the yellow pages and call one of those adds
15sml7bhh5s_3-8-rgb_front now if you are in town and you just decided to try massage therapy for the first time one of the best resources is of course people that you know and referrals
15sml7bhh5s_4-8-rgb_front so i would ask your friends and family if they ever received massage and if they did if they liked it and who they used and that is the best way to go
15sml7bhh5s_5-8-rgb_front another way you can go is amtamassage org is for the american massage therapy association they have a list of all their professionals and they are certified and registered massage therapist so that is the safe way to go
15sml7bhh5s_6-8-rgb_front when you do find somebody you want ask them some questions find out how long they have been licensed how long they have been practicing and what type of massage therapy that they do to make sure that they can meet your massage needs
15sml7bhh5s_7-8-rgb_front and then ask them any other questions that you might have
15sml7bhh5s_8-8-rgb_front and when you go to visit them if you are not comfortable you do have the right to speak up and say something and also to terminate the massage at anytime so do not forget that if the massage therapist goes to deep or you do not like the work you do have the right to say no
15sml7bhh5s_9-8-rgb_front but in general massage is a very enjoyable experience and it should be
163ylbutkli_0-8-rgb_front now the thing about creative drama is and this is where it is going to get a little tricky depending on where you are and what the rules and regulations of your state and your educational system are
163ylbutkli_1-8-rgb_front the educational system today is geared to teaching to the test
163ylbutkli_10-8-rgb_front but i encourage you to turn that material into dramas take the time to do it because the students will retain it longer
163ylbutkli_2-8-rgb_front and teachers have a tremendous amount of pressure to get x y z amount of material learned before this test and on and on the story goes
163ylbutkli_3-8-rgb_front creative drama is not about teaching to the test it is better
163ylbutkli_4-8-rgb_front because i guarantee you if you can take the components that you are teaching to the test and turn them into the dramas the students will learn them better
163ylbutkli_5-8-rgb_front the students will be able to retain the material longer than by simply teaching to the test with the direct style of teaching that you are using in your classroom right now
163ylbutkli_6-8-rgb_front students come up to me ten fifteen twenty years later all the time and tell me that they still remember this activity or this activity or that activity
163ylbutkli_7-8-rgb_front how many students come up ten twenty thirty years later and talk about the activities the things that they learned when they were taught to the test
163ylbutkli_8-8-rgb_front it is a totally different style of teaching
163ylbutkli_9-8-rgb_front so you can still teach towards the test in the sense of teaching the same material
16aa5bxivgo_0-8-rgb_front when your collecting iron stone we talked about different patterns the different types of iron stone collect what i wanted to just show you today is that iron stone base is the heavy weight to it and it comes in different forms
16aa5bxivgo_1-8-rgb_front this one in particular is the white base iron stone which you will see this has a little bit of flow blue and a little of luster on it
16aa5bxivgo_2-8-rgb_front this is an iron stone base but it is the flow blue patterns that are on here this is early century and you will find that this is just a flow blue pattern but you will find this in brown transfer
16aa5bxivgo_3-8-rgb_front which is an iron heavy base also you will find it in a red transfer the earlier the iron stone base is heavier base to it
16aa5bxivgo_4-8-rgb_front the other pieces that you find with iron stone base if the mulberry patterns a lot of those english wares made in the early to mid late century you will find that they have an iron stone base
16aa5bxivgo_5-8-rgb_front there made by the same a lot of these pieces are made by similar companies in england during the same period but they would produce the blue as well as the mulberry at the same time using the bases which are similar
16aa5bxivgo_6-8-rgb_front you might even find in iron stone a pattern that is the same as flow blue and you can find the same pattern in mulberry so there is a lot of different examples of iron stone bases that are used
16aa5bxivgo_7-8-rgb_front you can find a plain iron stone we also talked about lamoush and bases to the lamouch pattern that is iron stone also with lots of different patterns
16aa5bxivgo_8-8-rgb_front you can also find just a plain iron stone here that is made by a number of different companies in england these are all examples of heavy earth and ware that was made in century into the century
16aa5bxivgo_9-8-rgb_front they are very collectible and it all is very subjective it is what you find appealing so these are just a few example for you to look at before you start collecting

16w1jnzzfi4_12-8-rgb_front never use your spray paints inside the house it will smell for days
16w1jnzzfi4_13-8-rgb_front i like to take a coat hanger and fabricate me a little bracket for holding the body so i do not have to touch it with my hands
16w1jnzzfi4_14-8-rgb_front here is a handy little item you can get in home depot or lowes it simply attaches to your spray can and you are ready to start spraying
16w1jnzzfi4_15-8-rgb_front naturally you want to shake your paint up
16w1jnzzfi4_16-8-rgb_front your model car is clean and dry it is scuffed
16w1jnzzfi4_17-8-rgb_front here is a handy little thing you can buy a box of masks they have all different kind and this is better then just breathing straight in and it gives you that feeling like your in a real body shop
16w1jnzzfi4_18-8-rgb_front there is many different types of paint you can use from your automotive touch up paints which you can get in many many different automotive colors to your rustoleum
16w1jnzzfi4_19-8-rgb_front i like to use a gloss black or semi flat black for my chassis sometimes my interiors
16w1jnzzfi4_2-8-rgb_front ok we are going to talk a little about a bit about preparing our car for paint and actually painting the car
16w1jnzzfi4_20-8-rgb_front many different colors of household type paints you can buy
16w1jnzzfi4_21-8-rgb_front in your hobby stores they do have regular model car paint your medal flicks and what ever fancy candy colors you can think of but right now we have some american tradition valspar primer and we are going to shoot a little bit on the car
16w1jnzzfi4_22-8-rgb_front i like to start from the bottom and work my way over
16w1jnzzfi4_23-8-rgb_front if you start from the top and work your way down you could get some running in there
16w1jnzzfi4_24-8-rgb_front does not take much you do not want to get no runs
16w1jnzzfi4_25-8-rgb_front i do not know if you can see that paint flying but she is flying around and there is your car primed out we will wait about a hour we will be able to put some color on there
16w1jnzzfi4_3-8-rgb_front remember safety is the most important thing when using chemicals
16w1jnzzfi4_4-8-rgb_front you take your model car and you get like grip wet and dry automotive sandpaper you can pick that up in your local hardware stores
16w1jnzzfi4_5-8-rgb_front you want to scuff the body down and you want to sand it scuff it down so you get rid of that shiny finish
16w1jnzzfi4_6-8-rgb_front then using warm water and dish detergent you want to wash your car
16w1jnzzfi4_7-8-rgb_front you want to wet it rinse it off very well while you want to let it air dry
16w1jnzzfi4_8-8-rgb_front if you have a compressor you could blow it off but you want your car to be dry and what i like to do is i like to be in a well vented lighted space for safety
16w1jnzzfi4_9-8-rgb_front i like to use a cardboard box for paint booth
16_cbprlcb0_0-8-rgb_front so do you just have reeking breath that you are trying to get rid of
16_cbprlcb0_1-8-rgb_front well my name is michelle and i am a dental assistant with solutionz and i am here to explain to you what you can do to get better breath
16_cbprlcb0_10-8-rgb_front you just pop a clove in your mouth and kind of suck on it and chew on it for about one to two minutes
16_cbprlcb0_11-8-rgb_front this will kind of create a nice fresh type of clove scent in your mouth
16_cbprlcb0_12-8-rgb_front these are all great ways on how to get fresher breath but you definitely need to see your general dentist if you notice that you are doing these things and you are not taking care of the problem and you still just have that stinky breath
16_cbprlcb0_13-8-rgb_front you definitely want to check out with your doctor or your dentist to see what you can do that will help you with that in the long run
16_cbprlcb0_14-8-rgb_front once again my name is michelle and i am a dental assistant with solutionz and i just explained to you on how you can maintain your fresh breath
16_cbprlcb0_2-8-rgb_front of course you are going to want to brush and floss your teeth three times a day and also you can purchase like an mouth rinse with rinsing with this at least twice a day will help with kind of maintaining that nice fresh breath
16_cbprlcb0_3-8-rgb_front you also too it is pretty easy on on how to use
16_cbprlcb0_4-8-rgb_front you just want to read the directions on the back pour the solution into the cap and then just swish around with it
16_cbprlcb0_5-8-rgb_front you can sometimes what happens too if you tend to feel that you cannot swish around with the time that it is recommending you can dilute the mouth rinse
16_cbprlcb0_6-8-rgb_front this is not going to cause any difference in in the solution
16_cbprlcb0_7-8-rgb_front it is just going to cause due to the alcohol content that is in it that is why you are getting that burning sensation so if you just pour fifty percent of water and fifty percent of the mouth rinse into the cap and then just swish around this will kinda help therefore where you are able to rinse with it for the good one to two minutes of the recommended time
16_cbprlcb0_8-8-rgb_front if you can rinse with it a little bit longer than that be great because you can it is just going to help you maintain that fresh breath
16_cbprlcb0_9-8-rgb_front also too if you do not have access to a mouth rinse what you can do a natural way to kind of maintain a a fresh breath is chewing on cloves which you can easily purchase at the food store
16bplai_vtm_10-8-rgb_front if you feel like you have made a mistake or if there is this white border that is showing you can go ahead and cut
16bplai_vtm_11-8-rgb_front if you did not get close enough to the picture you can go ahead and put the ruler over it one more time and make it a really nice clean finish
16bplai_vtm_4-8-rgb_front we are scoring it right now
16bplai_vtm_5-8-rgb_front it may take even times
16bplai_vtm_6-8-rgb_front you do not want to press too terribly hard but do it several times until this foam core starts to come off
16bplai_vtm_7-8-rgb_front again you just want to take it easy and just kind of press this
16bplai_vtm_8-8-rgb_front once that side is done you will take it off
16bplai_vtm_9-8-rgb_front you can kind of clean up the edges a little bit
16ij0z4fuqc_0_1_2_3-8-rgb_front o k now we are going to start off with the bath tub and then we will move on to the shower so let me get my gloves on first
16ij0z4fuqc_10-8-rgb_front because i can not quite reach across right now
16ij0z4fuqc_11-8-rgb_front so i will just get everything out
16ij0z4fuqc_12-8-rgb_front so that we can start off with a clear surface to clean
16ij0z4fuqc_13-8-rgb_front now these items you want to make sure
16ij0z4fuqc_14-8-rgb_front well to me anyhow
16ij0z4fuqc_15-8-rgb_front i like to have them clean when they go back in
16ij0z4fuqc_16-8-rgb_front there is no point in cleaning a counter top
16ij0z4fuqc_17-8-rgb_front and then putting dirty things back on top of it
16ij0z4fuqc_18-8-rgb_front so i will go through all of these items and i will just wash down each item
16ij0z4fuqc_19-8-rgb_front with a damp cloth before i put it back into the bath tub
16ij0z4fuqc_20-8-rgb_front and with things like plants they get dusty on top
16ij0z4fuqc_21-8-rgb_front here is a really easy way
16ij0z4fuqc_22-8-rgb_front if it is a fake plant like this is
16ij0z4fuqc_23-8-rgb_front then i just run it under the water
16ij0z4fuqc_24-8-rgb_front and it gets all of the dust off of the leaves
16ij0z4fuqc_25-8-rgb_front and you know every thing is plastic
16ij0z4fuqc_26-8-rgb_front since nothing to nothing to ruin in any way
16ij0z4fuqc_27-8-rgb_front shake it upside down
16ij0z4fuqc_28-8-rgb_front and you do not even have to dry it
16ij0z4fuqc_29-8-rgb_front it is nice and green again
16ij0z4fuqc_30-8-rgb_front all the whites if you see on here
16ij0z4fuqc_31-8-rgb_front there is white dust sitting on there
16ij0z4fuqc_32-8-rgb_front this one is nice and fresh and shinning
16ij0z4fuqc_33-8-rgb_front this is easy as that
16ij0z4fuqc_4-8-rgb_front and what we are going to do is move anything that is sitting around your tub
16ij0z4fuqc_5-8-rgb_front there is no way you can clean around your items
16ij0z4fuqc_6-8-rgb_front you have to move them
16ij0z4fuqc_7-8-rgb_front because you just do not get a you do not get a thorough clean
16ij0z4fuqc_8-8-rgb_front and this is about thorough clean today
16ij0z4fuqc_9-8-rgb_front so and i usually get into the tub
16n946j6kpm_0-8-rgb_front alright now that we got it all buttered up scratch and slip
16n946j6kpm_1-8-rgb_front i am going to take our ring and place it on this
16n946j6kpm_10-8-rgb_front everyone is happy
16n946j6kpm_11-8-rgb_front there
16n946j6kpm_12-8-rgb_front ok
16n946j6kpm_13-8-rgb_front so that is almost there
16n946j6kpm_14-8-rgb_front now this a point where when you are working and your hand building
16n946j6kpm_15-8-rgb_front now take your time
16n946j6kpm_16-8-rgb_front make sure your hands are nice and clean
16n946j6kpm_17-8-rgb_front you do not leave a bunch of goofy fingerprints all over all your stuff
16n946j6kpm_18-8-rgb_front you want to just very touch very deliberately and very lightly at this point
16n946j6kpm_2-8-rgb_front alright
16n946j6kpm_3-8-rgb_front and i am just check out where it want to go
16n946j6kpm_4-8-rgb_front it will naturally find its own way
16n946j6kpm_5-8-rgb_front and then i see
16n946j6kpm_6-8-rgb_front i am going to look at my socky set and see what it is thinking
16n946j6kpm_7-8-rgb_front do you like it
16n946j6kpm_8-8-rgb_front nope
16n946j6kpm_9-8-rgb_front it wants to be in here
16y-dsx1mdk_1-8-rgb_front you could choose a custom frame but you also have the choice of doing a ready made frame
16y-dsx1mdk_10-8-rgb_front we have this picture of a little kitty
16y-dsx1mdk_11-8-rgb_front everyone loves their animals their cats and their dogs
16y-dsx1mdk_12-8-rgb_front so we choose which size we want to frame this in
16y-dsx1mdk_13-8-rgb_front we might choose an eleven by fourteen and it fits in that really nicely
16y-dsx1mdk_14-8-rgb_front but we might choose a sixteen by twenty
16y-dsx1mdk_15-8-rgb_front see
16y-dsx1mdk_16-8-rgb_front that leaves a little bit more matting around it
16y-dsx1mdk_17-8-rgb_front so then what we want to do is we will pick the matting that goes with it
16y-dsx1mdk_18-8-rgb_front so for me i have picked these two colors that i think would go very nicely with this picture
16y-dsx1mdk_19-8-rgb_front so you can take a simple picture of your cat or your dog or your children and make an absolutely gorgeous frame for it
16y-dsx1mdk_2-8-rgb_front we sell this custom frame here
16y-dsx1mdk_3-8-rgb_front it is like fifty dollars a foot
16y-dsx1mdk_4-8-rgb_front we have made a ready made out of this same molding because i did a large picture in this for my customer and i had a little bit left over
16y-dsx1mdk_5-8-rgb_front so this particular ready made is an eleven by fourteen and it regularly sells for three hundred and thirty five dollars
16y-dsx1mdk_6-8-rgb_front but with already mades we cut the price almost in half
16y-dsx1mdk_7-8-rgb_front so this ready made is one hundred and sixty eight
16y-dsx1mdk_8-8-rgb_front or you have this same one this is an eleven by fourteen the same size and it only runs thirty three dollars
16y-dsx1mdk_9-8-rgb_front so you can see how there is a huge difference between the price in one and the other
17n2zh5tmmi_0-8-rgb_front the next thing we are going to talk about and it is very important because we are dealing with a lot of water here is filtration
17n2zh5tmmi_1-8-rgb_front it is very important you get the proper filtration on a turtle tank otherwise you will end up with an extremely dirty tank
17n2zh5tmmi_10-8-rgb_front inside here we have our filter media
17n2zh5tmmi_11-8-rgb_front it comes in these little packets these little foam blocks
17n2zh5tmmi_12-8-rgb_front you buy these they come in packs of two
17n2zh5tmmi_13-8-rgb_front they last a long time you can actually wash them out and reuse them
17n2zh5tmmi_14-8-rgb_front then also you have three if i remember correctly maybe it is four three little containers in here that carry various types of filter medium
17n2zh5tmmi_15-8-rgb_front what we are going to put in here are these little white things these are bio beads
17n2zh5tmmi_16-8-rgb_front what they do is they allow beneficial bacteria to build up on them and that bacteria will help eat waste in your aquarium and take care of your turtle tank
17n2zh5tmmi_17-8-rgb_front we will talk about the rest of filtration in just a moment
17n2zh5tmmi_2-8-rgb_front greater risk of things like salmonella and stuff like that so you want to stay away from that
17n2zh5tmmi_3-8-rgb_front what we are looking at here is my preferred method for filtering a turtle tank
17n2zh5tmmi_4-8-rgb_front this is a fluvial canister filter
17n2zh5tmmi_5-8-rgb_front this sits outside of the aquarium and there is two tubes that run out of the top of it and run into the aquarium
17n2zh5tmmi_6-8-rgb_front they are pretty easy to use essentially
17n2zh5tmmi_7-8-rgb_front once we open it up in here and look inside
17n2zh5tmmi_8-8-rgb_front it just open up with the clamp the top the whole top comes off
17n2zh5tmmi_9-8-rgb_front set that aside for now
17_giymulk8_1-8-rgb_front just want to show you an alternative way to stage a plant into a decorative pot outside of just mossing the plant
17_giymulk8_2-8-rgb_front real quick here i have a ficus corkscrew i have a decorative pot with a deep vinyl saucer
17_giymulk8_3-8-rgb_front i want to put this plant in here i have chosen this pot out i think it looks good with the tree but i think it looks a little naked in there by itself and i want to make sure it has something other than moss on the top
17_giymulk8_4-8-rgb_front i recommend in top dressing like this it often looks good to put alternative lower plants that fill the bottom out
17_giymulk8_5-8-rgb_front and i am using two deep vinyl saucers because you want to saucer everything individually and drop in what i have are some pothos which fill out quite nicely and are great lower light plants and drop those into those saucers
17_giymulk8_6-8-rgb_front and as an alternative to just having moss at the bottom of the plant or nothing at all you have some nice full decorative foliage in their own saucers because they have different water needs than the ficus
17_giymulk8_7-8-rgb_front filling that pot out and if i want to see the pot a little bit more i can move things aside a little bit
17_giymulk8_8-8-rgb_front but it is just a great alternative way to top dress a plant and stage it correctly in a professional manner that an interior company would such as ourselves
17a7orctz2k_1-3-rgb_front before i was doing this i was showing i had another section here to roll
17a7orctz2k_10-3-rgb_front another roller here for the wave
17a7orctz2k_11-3-rgb_front smaller roller here pushing it up for the wave
17a7orctz2k_12-3-rgb_front that will give you like a piggy back effect like that
17a7orctz2k_13-3-rgb_front it will come out wavy like this
17a7orctz2k_14-3-rgb_front i was about to finish it and then i decided to show you that you can also finish it this way
17a7orctz2k_2-3-rgb_front in order for it to do a wave and piggy back on her head you have to place those real nice and close to the scalp like that
17a7orctz2k_3-3-rgb_front then you are going to go and roll a full head of hair a full roller onto her like this
17a7orctz2k_4-3-rgb_front you are going to take the hair and roll it on the roller
17a7orctz2k_5-3-rgb_front rolling it on the roller
17a7orctz2k_6-3-rgb_front just rolling it
17a7orctz2k_7-3-rgb_front let is get better control of the hair
17a7orctz2k_8-3-rgb_front you can do this too
17a7orctz2k_9-3-rgb_front placing another roller here for security
17aymgoqfkw_0-8-rgb_front i am ivan madar
17aymgoqfkw_10-8-rgb_front if things linger and are not repaired then it creates the tremendous dissatisfaction on the part of the members or our guest visiting the resort
17aymgoqfkw_11-8-rgb_front so it is important to fix it right away
17aymgoqfkw_12-8-rgb_front there is nothing more distressing when you walk in let is say in a fitness area and every other treadmill has a sign on it it is out of operation
17aymgoqfkw_13-8-rgb_front if you do put a sign on something that it is out of operation it should be dated and it should state when it is going to be repaired so people do not come and just wonder what is going to happen
17aymgoqfkw_14-8-rgb_front those are kind of basic principles of good relations with the members and the staff your maintenance staff
17aymgoqfkw_2-8-rgb_front maintenance of a facility obviously it is not that complicated
17aymgoqfkw_3-8-rgb_front we know what we have to do to maintain the heating and air conditioning and the plumbing in here
17aymgoqfkw_4-8-rgb_front the question becomes do you have the staff that does all these repairs when necessary or do you hire contractors
17aymgoqfkw_5-8-rgb_front i tend to have one person on staff depending on the size of the facility obviously but at least one person who is a universal handyman who can fix everything except the large large jobs
17aymgoqfkw_6-8-rgb_front that person should be available to the facility for at least two shifts
17aymgoqfkw_7-8-rgb_front meaning about sixteen hours a day
17aymgoqfkw_8-8-rgb_front so whenever something breaks you have to fix it right away
17aymgoqfkw_9-8-rgb_front in a private club it is not acceptable that things are broken for longer than necessary and it is usually only a few hours or at the most one day to the next
17bhb8eom5g_0-8-rgb_front alright in this clip we are going to be going over how to go over the bags that we are stacking up
17bhb8eom5g_1-8-rgb_front these are great to do and it is going to help you to get higher and start jumping a lot better for your double leg
17bhb8eom5g_10-8-rgb_front that is why these are really good practice to use for the double legs
17bhb8eom5g_2-8-rgb_front if you touch it you do not want to touch it because if you do they are going to fall over
17bhb8eom5g_3-8-rgb_front these are very wobbly and it is going to really push you to not touch and get over and they are also very soft so you will not get hurt
17bhb8eom5g_4-8-rgb_front all these are punching bags and if you practice martial arts they should have them or if you are doing gymnastics in a place they should also have other things that you can stack up that are very soft that you can practice going over
17bhb8eom5g_5-8-rgb_front alright so same motion and you should be able to do your double leg by now going over the mat and that is the best way to practice getting it down so now let is go ahead and practice going over these
17bhb8eom5g_6-8-rgb_front you can see as i went into my double leg same motion same thing but this time i really tried to clear it without touching it so this is great practice if you want to practice going over people for performances it looks great
17bhb8eom5g_7-8-rgb_front another good thing these are good for is when you start doing your double things at a certain height it is a mind thing when you start taking the stuff away it gets harder to do your double legs so as you get it and you get more comfortable with it start taking them off
17bhb8eom5g_8-8-rgb_front so actually start high and then start going lower and lower just like that and then soon you will want to get all the way to the ground without anything
17bhb8eom5g_9-8-rgb_front you are going to find this is the most challenging spot because in your mind you are not going to push yourself to jump as high and some people as soon as they take this away they just go this low and bam fall to the ground
17g6wyytwzs_0-8-rgb_front the plants when they come up and begin to draw will be long and skinny
17g6wyytwzs_1-8-rgb_front the more sunlight that you can put on them the more robust the plant will be the thicker the stem and the less skinny or tall stem with a few limbs on the end of it
17g6wyytwzs_2-8-rgb_front when you get ready to transplant them in the garden it is best if you have a robust or short squat plant than a tall skinny one
17g6wyytwzs_3-8-rgb_front this is the wrong time of the year to be showing you any seedlings since this is the first ones that i have put in the ground in dirt but from last year from seeds that were spilled on the ground on the floor of my greenhouse we do have a more or less grown tomato plant which will have the same type leaves as the little ones will eventually
17g6wyytwzs_4-8-rgb_front i am not sure what variety this is but this is a sure enough tomato plant that has been growing here all winter in the hard soil with no water with no care and i am assuming if i were to water it a little bit and take care of it some of his buddies over there did not like tomatoes quite as well that it would probably produce tomatoes for me this spring
17hrr6qzbdu_0-8-rgb_front so i am talking to you about improv comedy and what i want to talk about right now is book recommendations
17hrr6qzbdu_1-8-rgb_front a lot of people in my improv classes ask me for what books they should read and i have read a ton of improv books and many of them are the same and some are better than others so here is my list of recommendations for improv books and which books are good for what things
17hrr6qzbdu_10-8-rgb_front this is by charna halpern and del close founders of second city and improv olympic and this is another classic improv comedy text
17hrr6qzbdu_11-8-rgb_front it is going to go over the basics
17hrr6qzbdu_12-8-rgb_front it is going to drop a lot of celebrity names at you to try and impress you
17hrr6qzbdu_13-8-rgb_front do not worry about the celebrity names just focus on the content
17hrr6qzbdu_14-8-rgb_front there is some good stuff in here also very short
17hrr6qzbdu_15-8-rgb_front this is the book i would recommend the playbook improv games for performers collected and edited by my friend william hall and if you want to just get a list of improv games i think this is the best book that is a compilation of improv games
17hrr6qzbdu_16-8-rgb_front it is divided up by category
17hrr6qzbdu_17-8-rgb_front there is great descriptions of the different games
17hrr6qzbdu_18-8-rgb_front there is some great quotes in the back
17hrr6qzbdu_19-8-rgb_front it is small enough to fit in your backpack your pocket and keep it with you in rehearsals so if you want to learn a lot of improv games this is the book for you
17hrr6qzbdu_2-8-rgb_front my number one recommendation would be impro by keith johnstone
17hrr6qzbdu_20-8-rgb_front if you are interested in narrative long form like i am this is the book i would recommend acting on impulse by carol hazenfield a wonderful book
17hrr6qzbdu_21-8-rgb_front she is an amazing teacher
17hrr6qzbdu_22-8-rgb_front i have gotten to study with her and i read this book and i just wish i had written it
17hrr6qzbdu_23-8-rgb_front she covers great topics
17hrr6qzbdu_24-8-rgb_front it is very succinct very clear
17hrr6qzbdu_25-8-rgb_front she is got exercises attached to each of the topics and it covers storytelling narrative long form and also it is really good if you are starting your own troupe
17hrr6qzbdu_26-8-rgb_front she is got a great chapter about troupe mechanics how to do those first rehearsals how to do notes and those kind of things something that is missing from a lot of improv books acting on impulse
17hrr6qzbdu_27-8-rgb_front if you are a super nerd like me and you really love narrative long form i recommend the writers journey by christopher vogler
17hrr6qzbdu_28-8-rgb_front this is actually a book for screenwriters using mythic storytelling structure from joseph campbell and adapting it for screenwriters and then i further adapt it for improvisers so this is a text i use a lot in my own rehearsals
17hrr6qzbdu_29-8-rgb_front lastly if you are interested in applied improv applied improv is using improv not for performance but for businesses and organizations
17hrr6qzbdu_3-8-rgb_front this is a seminal text about improvisation mainly about the psychological approach to improv what goes on in the mind and the body when you are improvising
17hrr6qzbdu_30-8-rgb_front this is the book i recommend improvise this
17hrr6qzbdu_31-8-rgb_front how to think on your feet so you do not fall on your face by mark bergren molly cox and jim detmar
17hrr6qzbdu_32-8-rgb_front this is a great introduction to how you can use improv for the business world so those are some of my book recommendations
17hrr6qzbdu_33-8-rgb_front you can find them online or your local bookseller and i hope you enjoy them but i still recommend do improv first read about it second
17hrr6qzbdu_4-8-rgb_front i really recommend this to beginners or new improvisers
17hrr6qzbdu_5-8-rgb_front i recommend it for my improv class
17hrr6qzbdu_6-8-rgb_front it is short
17hrr6qzbdu_7-8-rgb_front it is really readable and do not even worry about the last section about masks it is kind of weird and do not worry about it
17hrr6qzbdu_8-8-rgb_front the rest though is really good
17hrr6qzbdu_9-8-rgb_front ok the next book i recommend is truth in comedy
17ijcow43q8_0-8-rgb_front hi
17ijcow43q8_10-8-rgb_front or is that not an important feature to you
17ijcow43q8_11-8-rgb_front do you want something that has the freezer on top and the fresh fruit area below
17ijcow43q8_12-8-rgb_front do you want to bottom out like this with a single swing door on it
17ijcow43q8_2-8-rgb_front the first thing you need to know about a refrigerator is its overall size
17ijcow43q8_3-8-rgb_front is it going to meet your needs adequately
17ijcow43q8_4-8-rgb_front if it is a remodel and you are going to be doing the cupboards you need to get the specifications from your contractor to see how wide the opening is as well as the height of the opening also
17ijcow43q8_5-8-rgb_front if it is brand new construction you really do not have to worry about that
17ijcow43q8_6-8-rgb_front so much as you do with your existing construction that is in place already
17ijcow43q8_7-8-rgb_front color is another thing that is valuable to know
17ijcow43q8_8-8-rgb_front what color do you want
17ijcow43q8_9-8-rgb_front is it going to match your other appliances
17je4iczjie_1-8-rgb_front the first recipe i am going to show is how to make green bean casserole from scratch
17je4iczjie_2-8-rgb_front the first step we have to trim off the green beans we have to cut off the tail and the head
17je4iczjie_3-8-rgb_front as you can see those parts are very tough and they are not eatable
17je4iczjie_4-8-rgb_front then for the longer green beans after we trim off the head and the tail we also cut them in the middle
17je4iczjie_5-8-rgb_front as you can see if you do not want to cut it one by one you can just get a bunch of them just make sure they lie perfectly and then cut off the head and then the tail
17je4iczjie_6-8-rgb_front for this recipe you do not necessarily have to use those fancy french cuts for your green beans because once the green bean is cooked in the casserole you can only tell the shape
17owshmbca0_1-3-rgb_front so now we are going to peel our shrimp
17owshmbca0_10-3-rgb_front you are going to make some really shrimp stock with this these shells so i encourage you we only have a few here but you can put them in a bag in the freezer
17owshmbca0_11-3-rgb_front then you have enough accumulated you can make some shrimp stock
17owshmbca0_2-3-rgb_front so we have some beautiful brown gulf shrimp here
17owshmbca0_3-3-rgb_front what i am going to do this is the head is already off
17owshmbca0_4-3-rgb_front what i want to do is just go ahead and just put my thumb right there just on the bottom
17owshmbca0_5-3-rgb_front you kind of peel off this tip part layer of shell and at that point go ahead and hold pull on it like this
17owshmbca0_6-3-rgb_front pinch this end of it and the shell would come right off
17owshmbca0_7-3-rgb_front so now you have a beautiful shrimp just like that
17owshmbca0_8-3-rgb_front so we are going to do this to our others
17owshmbca0_9-3-rgb_front just go ahead and take that top part off
17wfk7bkwoo_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is amy kistler and i am going to talk to you a little bit about the different types of personal trainers
17wfk7bkwoo_1-8-rgb_front there is all different types of personal trainers
17wfk7bkwoo_10-8-rgb_front personal trainers do not always specialize in one activity
17wfk7bkwoo_11-8-rgb_front some have a wide range of experience and they are open to all different types of training
17wfk7bkwoo_12-8-rgb_front for example some trainers do core training
17wfk7bkwoo_13-8-rgb_front they also do full body weight training
17wfk7bkwoo_14-8-rgb_front some break up training to do biceps and tris and then some break it up and do back and bis
17wfk7bkwoo_15-8-rgb_front all different types of trainers do different types of exercises
17wfk7bkwoo_16-8-rgb_front they train sports players
17wfk7bkwoo_17-8-rgb_front they train the average joe
17wfk7bkwoo_18-8-rgb_front they train somebody that just wants to plain and simply lose weight
17wfk7bkwoo_19-8-rgb_front they train someone that wants to put on a little bit more muscle mass
17wfk7bkwoo_2-8-rgb_front you have personal trainers that specialize in yoga
17wfk7bkwoo_20-8-rgb_front and they also train people that are going to get married
17wfk7bkwoo_21-8-rgb_front so they do basic overall training which is what most people out there are looking for
17wfk7bkwoo_22-8-rgb_front there are personal trainers that are specialized in specific sports
17wfk7bkwoo_23-8-rgb_front so for example we have personal trainers that can help you improve your basketball skills that can help you improve your volleyball skills that can help improve you in running
17wfk7bkwoo_24-8-rgb_front you can also get a personal trainer to help write you a program on how to progress and how to work up to running in a marathon
17wfk7bkwoo_3-8-rgb_front you have got personal trainers that specialize in karate
17wfk7bkwoo_4-8-rgb_front you have personal trainers that specialize in dance that specialize in core that specialize in fitness
17wfk7bkwoo_5-8-rgb_front there is a huge range of different types of personal trainers
17wfk7bkwoo_6-8-rgb_front if you are considering getting a personal trainer you want to make sure that you are aware of what you want your goals to be so that you can get a personal trainer that is right for you
17wfk7bkwoo_7-8-rgb_front for example if a personal trainer specializes in core exercises they are going to be doing exercises that are related to the core area
17wfk7bkwoo_8-8-rgb_front just because we say core does not mean it is all ab exercises
17wfk7bkwoo_9-8-rgb_front it means the whole body
17wk8jxejvo_1-8-rgb_front so before we are going to attach the front to the rest of the pieces what we are going to do is take some elastic and we are actually going to make a little holder to hold bottles of wine
17wk8jxejvo_10-8-rgb_front so go ahead and take it to your machine we are just going to run two stitches on either side and then a stitch down the center
17wk8jxejvo_11_12-8-rgb_front you want to go back and forth a few times just to make sure that is pretty secured go ahead and do the center seam the same way again i like to make these fairly large because if you do want to say use one of those two litter bottles of water or i think a liter in a half those are fairly large cause you do want to give space for them to fairly fit
17wk8jxejvo_13-8-rgb_front then do your last seam and now you are ready to pin it to the rest of your lining pieces
17wk8jxejvo_2-8-rgb_front so this will make it so easy if you are going grocery shopping and have a few bottles so they do not slide around
17wk8jxejvo_3-8-rgb_front also if you are going on a picnic if you do not drink of course you can just add some bottle of water or ice tea or something like that
17wk8jxejvo_4-8-rgb_front so what i did was just take a piece of elastic and your just going to measure out the same size as your bag
17wk8jxejvo_5-8-rgb_front you want to leave about three inches on either side and just go ahead and cut your going to find your center point put a pin and take two more pins
17wk8jxejvo_6-8-rgb_front i am just going to give about two fingers worth ease because what you want theoretically is for this to be able to stretch and securely hold your wine bottles
17wk8jxejvo_7-8-rgb_front so two fingers of ease would be great
17wk8jxejvo_8-8-rgb_front then you are going to put a pin on each side again just put your two fingers then you can trim some of the excess
17wk8jxejvo_9-8-rgb_front you do want to leave a little bit of excess into the seam allowance cause this will just make sure that once you stitch everything up that your wine holder is secured
1835p3jeejw_0-8-rgb_front hi
1835p3jeejw_1-8-rgb_front i am michael seto
1835p3jeejw_10-8-rgb_front silver is going to give a harder reflection white will give a softer reflection
1835p3jeejw_11-8-rgb_front so what i do to help magnify the light i just set this up around the piece of jewelry
1835p3jeejw_12-8-rgb_front this is very similar to a shooting enclosure in a way
1835p3jeejw_13-8-rgb_front we showed you the in one of the other clips the lighthouse the light tent this is very similar to that and it is just a basic setup to shoot jewelry a couple of lights a piece of white paper or and a couple of white and silver reflectors along with your camera and tripod
1835p3jeejw_14-8-rgb_front get you started
1835p3jeejw_2-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about the basic setup for shooting a piece of jewelry
1835p3jeejw_3-8-rgb_front if we look down at my table here we have got the beginning elements of the basic setup
1835p3jeejw_4-8-rgb_front you have got the jewelry a piece of white here which we talked about earlier we got the camera a digital slr set up on a tripod and we have got here two florescent lamps they are daylight balanced so that the white balance is close to daylight and you are not getting blue or red tinge to it
1835p3jeejw_5-8-rgb_front so this is a basic jewelry setup
1835p3jeejw_6-8-rgb_front with this you can shoot a basic shot and we are pretty much ready to go
1835p3jeejw_7-8-rgb_front one thing you may want to add though reflectors
1835p3jeejw_8-8-rgb_front i use a lot of these they are very useful
1835p3jeejw_9-8-rgb_front i just buy some cardboard at the art store that is silver on one side white on the other
18nascihoms_0-8-rgb_front joe parsons so i am thinking about getting a puzzle
18nascihoms_1-8-rgb_front les mcgehee really
18nascihoms_10-8-rgb_front the first one we are going to try that is a simple one
18nascihoms_11-8-rgb_front this is a great one that you can play with your family and friends in the car and it helps to get your mind working
18nascihoms_12-8-rgb_front we call it things in
18nascihoms_13-8-rgb_front joe you want to start a things in
18nascihoms_14-8-rgb_front explain to these people
18nascihoms_15-8-rgb_front joe parsons sure
18nascihoms_16-8-rgb_front all right les i wonder if you can name for me things in your backyard
18nascihoms_17-8-rgb_front les mcgehee a swing set
18nascihoms_18-8-rgb_front joe parsons one
18nascihoms_19-8-rgb_front les mcgehee a dog with red hair
18nascihoms_2-8-rgb_front i was reviewing the other day how my mortgage was advertising joe parsons
18nascihoms_20-8-rgb_front joe parsons two
18nascihoms_21-8-rgb_front les mcgehee a hole in the fence that needs to patched
18nascihoms_22-8-rgb_front joe parsons three
18nascihoms_23-8-rgb_front les mcgehee a large amount of jalapeno peppers and lemons on the vine
18nascihoms_24-8-rgb_front joe parsons four
18nascihoms_25-8-rgb_front les mcgehee and a lemon tree because lemons do not grow on vines
18nascihoms_26-8-rgb_front joe parsons five very nice
18nascihoms_27-8-rgb_front les mcgehee you see how that works and now i can issue him a challenge as well
18nascihoms_28-8-rgb_front and one thing to remember is that if you have a creative idea that feels funny to you you use it
18nascihoms_29-8-rgb_front and anytime you do not feel inspired by an idea just call the thing whatever it is
18nascihoms_3-8-rgb_front les mcgehee makes noise and we are back
18nascihoms_30-8-rgb_front there is grass in my backyard
18nascihoms_31-8-rgb_front and this way you are accepting inspiration when it comes but you do not feel any pressure
18nascihoms_32-8-rgb_front you just maintain the game and inspiration comes again when it is ready to and that helps to support everybody is creations at the same time
18nascihoms_33-8-rgb_front what are things in dolly parton is handbag joe
18nascihoms_34-8-rgb_front joe parsons kleenex lipstick and a brassiere
18nascihoms_35-8-rgb_front les mcgehee what are things bozo the clown will not be in the same room with
18nascihoms_36-8-rgb_front joe parsons barbara bush a buick a giant tub of red vines licorice
18nascihoms_37-8-rgb_front les mcgehee ooh
18nascihoms_38-8-rgb_front joe parsons plastic forks and a tree that grows purple fruit
18nascihoms_39-8-rgb_front les mcgehee that is absolutely correct joseph and you do not win anything
18nascihoms_4-8-rgb_front hey it is les mcgehee from les mcgehee plays well with others
18nascihoms_40-8-rgb_front but it was really funny and correct
18nascihoms_41-8-rgb_front now you notice whatever he says would have been correct because i am not here to judge him i am here to play with him
18nascihoms_42-8-rgb_front you have plenty of time to judge things in your life that is a thing we all have to do but we are not doing that now we are just playing
18nascihoms_5-8-rgb_front my name is on there because i wrote that book and it is about improvisation and about having a lengthy career with a lot of miles in the improvisation arts
18nascihoms_6-8-rgb_front along the way i was lucky enough to meet joe parsons who may not look so funny now but he really is
18nascihoms_7-8-rgb_front believe me you will have to take my word for it
18nascihoms_8-8-rgb_front now joe and i we are going to try a few improv games for you right here and these are not entertainment games
18nascihoms_9-8-rgb_front these are games that we play with each other before shows just to warm up and get in the frame of mind and everybody get together before we do a show
18o8tylgjtg_0-8-rgb_front as i mentioned not everybody could afford a clock actually only kings and nobility and then eventually rich people but most people knew what time it was from public clocks
18o8tylgjtg_1-8-rgb_front it was a sign of prestige in europe and then in america if your town had a public clock and eventually you got to where there were many public clocks in the town often dueling bells where the church is and the town halls were fighting over who had the correct time which often had to be established by the use of a sundial oddly enough
18o8tylgjtg_10-8-rgb_front this is copper that originally was guilded
18o8tylgjtg_11-8-rgb_front you can see little specks of gold on here but nobody has repainted this and it is sort of in the nice original condition that it came from
18o8tylgjtg_12-8-rgb_front i have a pair of these hanging on the wall in my house and they are lots of fun to own
18o8tylgjtg_13-8-rgb_front you also see that there is another pole coming out the end here which actually is a counter weight because if this hand were just attached here it would be so heavy that the clock could not move it around in the big dial like you see here so you need it counter weighted and it worked unless perhaps you had a pigeon sitting on the end and that sometimes was enough to stop the clock
18o8tylgjtg_2-8-rgb_front but public time keeping was how most people knew what time it was
18o8tylgjtg_3-8-rgb_front this is a church near me in north andover massachusetts i am talking to you from andover mass
18o8tylgjtg_4-8-rgb_front now but this is again is the way the people of north andover back in the seventeen and even eighteen hundreds until they could afford their own clocks that is how they knew what time it was
18o8tylgjtg_5-8-rgb_front of course this always had a bell on the steeple as well because unless you were near by this church you could not read the time on the face you had to listen for the bells and know what time it was
18o8tylgjtg_6-8-rgb_front of course the bells always rang when the indians were coming or when it was time for a wedding or a funeral or church service but ordinarily if they rang out the hours then you would know what time it was
18o8tylgjtg_7-8-rgb_front something that clock collectors often try to have at least one set of are actual hands from a tower clock
18o8tylgjtg_8-8-rgb_front as you can see in the picture the hands are still there so i did not steal it off my neighboring church but this supposedly was off a church somewhere in maine but it was being sold by an antique dealer
18o8tylgjtg_9-8-rgb_front we will talk about condition of course later on but this is really the way you want to see something like this
18pyceuqufq_0-8-rgb_front all right so you want to leave more than enough clay to work with
18pyceuqufq_1-8-rgb_front so i am going to cut it way down here and it should just fall off just like that and you set that aside right there next to your teapot
18pyceuqufq_2-8-rgb_front all right now all we have to do is let all that set up and while that is setting up we can go ahead and make a make a handle let that set up too and we will then by the time everything is all ready to go what we are going to do is take this lid want to flip it upside down clean the top and depending on how the handle looks either put another handle on here or put a little knob or something the to where you can just lift it off the teapot
18pyceuqufq_3-8-rgb_front and then we will go and we will connect this we will put our little filter holes in there and then be that with the mockett teapot and should be ready to go
18piulfjleq_0-2-rgb_front another sign that labor is getting closer is lightening
18piulfjleq_1-2-rgb_front lightening is when your baby actually drops deeper into your pelvis
18piulfjleq_10-2-rgb_front so you can eat more at a time because you have got room in your stomach
18piulfjleq_11-2-rgb_front it is easier to digest your food because there is more room with your intestines there
18piulfjleq_12-2-rgb_front and also you can breathe easier because there is more room in your lungs
18piulfjleq_13-2-rgb_front now how you really know even more than that is as that baby drops that baby is going to drop right onto your bladder
18piulfjleq_14-2-rgb_front so you already probably feel like you have to urinate all the time now you feel like you have to urinate even more
18piulfjleq_15-2-rgb_front and that is because the baby is head really literally is right on your bladder
18piulfjleq_16-2-rgb_front so that is a sign that labor is coming soon when your baby drops or is engaged deeper in your pelvis
18piulfjleq_17-2-rgb_front so this is actually what is going on when your baby is lightening or dropping
18piulfjleq_18-2-rgb_front this is what your body looked like before you got pregnant and this is what it looks like now
18piulfjleq_19-2-rgb_front so if you see your stomach is right up here in your chest these are your intestines right here and this is your bladder
18piulfjleq_2-2-rgb_front it also is called engaging or dropping
18piulfjleq_20-2-rgb_front before you got pregnant you had a lot more room here because there was not a baby in here
18piulfjleq_21-2-rgb_front now that you have got a baby in here everything is pushed up or everything is pushed down
18piulfjleq_22-2-rgb_front so before your baby drops or is lightening this is way up high in your chest
18piulfjleq_23-2-rgb_front so when your baby drops the bladder which is right here the baby is going to drop into your pelvis deeper in there and put that pressure on the bladder
18piulfjleq_24-2-rgb_front but that then is going to give you more room up top
18piulfjleq_25-2-rgb_front so that is what it looks like when your baby drops or lightenings
18piulfjleq_3-2-rgb_front so this can occur a few weeks before you go into labor this can occur a few days or a few hours
18piulfjleq_4-2-rgb_front in some women it actually happens while they are in labor
18piulfjleq_5-2-rgb_front but for most women it starts sooner
18piulfjleq_6-2-rgb_front usually women can know that their baby is dropping because they feel very different
18piulfjleq_7-2-rgb_front when your baby is high up in your stomach it is closer to your stomach and your chest and so you have trouble eating because when you eat your stomach feels full really fast because your stomach is pushed up higher into your body
18piulfjleq_8-2-rgb_front you also might have more indigestion and more heart burn because there is less room for your intestines
18piulfjleq_9-2-rgb_front so once the baby drops you get more room in there
18yqls_nlii_1-8-rgb_front in this segment i showed you all different stuff about our natural beauty costmetics
18yqls_nlii_2-8-rgb_front you learned a little bit of why to chose minerals over the over the counter products how to apply and course our different materials needed to apply our different application
18yqls_nlii_3-8-rgb_front think you very much for watching stay tune for other series in this group
18c67jsmbxe_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is dave schoeneck we are here in the beautiful wasatch mountains of utah here to talk about adaptive sports and how snowshoeing can fit in with a lot of people is adaptive life
18c67jsmbxe_1-8-rgb_front this is another good stretch you just athletic stance and reach towards each toe
18c67jsmbxe_10-8-rgb_front i am kind of grabbing my ski pants
18c67jsmbxe_11-8-rgb_front you can grab your leg it depends on how flexible you are
18c67jsmbxe_12-8-rgb_front i am fairly flexible but i mentioned earlier i have a prosthetic hip so i am not as flexible as i used to be
18c67jsmbxe_2-8-rgb_front hold it there hold it there and then same thing right side
18c67jsmbxe_3-8-rgb_front you really feel that in the hamstrings and in the glute muscles and that is a really an important muscle to stretch and get prepared because you will be using that a lot
18c67jsmbxe_4-8-rgb_front you are going to want to get into your athletic stance your feet are shoulders width apart and you are just going to bend down at the waist following the legs down until you feel the stretch reaching for those toes
18c67jsmbxe_5-8-rgb_front reach reach and you hold it get as low as you can go and hold it and then try to go a little lower
18c67jsmbxe_6-8-rgb_front there you go
18c67jsmbxe_7-8-rgb_front this is really stretching the quad and you want to be straight up this left leg straight and then you are just pulling the right quad back until you just feel that burn right there in the quad muscle
18c67jsmbxe_8-8-rgb_front hold it hold it as long as you can
18c67jsmbxe_9-8-rgb_front then do the same thing with the other leg
18cpzsbtuqe_0-8-rgb_front so our goblet has set up overnight the connection has reached the leather hard stage and we are ready to trim it
18cpzsbtuqe_1-8-rgb_front we are going to put it back on the
18cpzsbtuqe_10-8-rgb_front in this case because i am trying to make it look a little bit like a wine glass
18cpzsbtuqe_11-8-rgb_front and then once you have done that there is kind of an endless number of possibilities of what you can do to the stem
18cpzsbtuqe_12-8-rgb_front think of it like a table leg that you are turning on a lathe
18cpzsbtuqe_13-8-rgb_front you can make a ball you can make little points
18cpzsbtuqe_14-8-rgb_front there is so many different things you can do with this
18cpzsbtuqe_15-8-rgb_front i like to go simple
18cpzsbtuqe_16-8-rgb_front so i am just going to make this little ball with an undercut
18cpzsbtuqe_17-8-rgb_front and there we have a completed goblet ready to dry and go to the firing process
18cpzsbtuqe_2-8-rgb_front make sure that it is nice and centered by tapping it a little bit
18cpzsbtuqe_3-8-rgb_front and then tighten it a little bit more
18cpzsbtuqe_4-8-rgb_front a lot of times your stem and your cup will be just slightly off center from each and that is not a big deal
18cpzsbtuqe_5-8-rgb_front once you have trimmed it and it is complete no one will ever know
18cpzsbtuqe_6-8-rgb_front you are going to use a ribbon tool to do the trimming
18cpzsbtuqe_7-8-rgb_front it is called a ribbon tool because it makes a ribbon of clay whenever you press it against the clay to trim it off
18cpzsbtuqe_8-8-rgb_front and the first thing you want to do is shape the bowl
18cpzsbtuqe_9-8-rgb_front you want that cup to have a nice smooth curve
195t2urpc8s_0-8-rgb_front gina kennedy one of the bandhas in yoga uddiyana bandha drawing your belly button into the spine is one that we like to work on and use for abdominal core strength which you use throughout your yoga practice
195t2urpc8s_1-8-rgb_front there is no better pose than tolasana to help you gain abdominal strength and you must use uddiyana bandha which means a flying up a lifting up where you pull your belly button into the spine and then lift it all the way up to give you an energetic lift
195t2urpc8s_10-8-rgb_front good
195t2urpc8s_11-8-rgb_front lower down for just a moment
195t2urpc8s_12-8-rgb_front good
195t2urpc8s_13-8-rgb_front breathe in and then she is going to lift up again
195t2urpc8s_14-8-rgb_front she is going to press her hands into the blocks lift her behind and then if she can lift her toes
195t2urpc8s_15-8-rgb_front now she might not be able to do that right away
195t2urpc8s_16-8-rgb_front you might just be able to lift one or the other and feel free to just practice there cause this is a pose that takes an awful lot of abdominal strength
195t2urpc8s_2-8-rgb_front i am going to have faith we are going to do tolasana scale pose and she is going to use these blocks under her hands to help her
195t2urpc8s_3-8-rgb_front good
195t2urpc8s_4-8-rgb_front so first i am just going to have you crush your ankles faith and bring your knees in towards each other so seated yeah right like that
195t2urpc8s_5-8-rgb_front good
195t2urpc8s_6-8-rgb_front so i am going to have faith press in to her hands draw her belly button into the spine using uddiyana bandha and lift her tailbone up off the ground
195t2urpc8s_7-8-rgb_front good
195t2urpc8s_8-8-rgb_front now she is really going to have to pull her belly in even tighter to then lift her feet up
195t2urpc8s_9-8-rgb_front and there she swings like the scales
199heekd1au_0-8-rgb_front hi guys

199heekd1au_16-8-rgb_front put that aside
199heekd1au_17-8-rgb_front now same thing with the onion
199heekd1au_18-8-rgb_front i am going to use half an onion
199heekd1au_19-8-rgb_front you want to use the same amount of onion as you would the bell pepper
199heekd1au_2-8-rgb_front i am going to make a vegetarian version of the enchiladas for the vegetarian of the house
199heekd1au_20-8-rgb_front make sure to get all that stuff peeled off that i was talking about all that nastiness
199heekd1au_21-8-rgb_front you just want to cut this down into long slices
199heekd1au_22-8-rgb_front just like that
199heekd1au_23-8-rgb_front as far as preparing for this you want to lightly coat this with some extra virgin olive oil
199heekd1au_24-8-rgb_front that way the seasoning is going to stick
199heekd1au_25-8-rgb_front stick some fresh ground black pepper
199heekd1au_26-8-rgb_front you want to evenly coat all the vegetables
199heekd1au_27-8-rgb_front you are definitely going to need some salt
199heekd1au_28-8-rgb_front as far as salt and pepper goes you just want to eyeball it and season to taste
199heekd1au_29-8-rgb_front me i am just going to season that is probably about teaspoons
199heekd1au_3-8-rgb_front i got my beef chicken now i am doing the vegetable enchilada
199heekd1au_30-8-rgb_front then i am also going to use a little garlic powder
199heekd1au_31-8-rgb_front what you want to do is you want to toss all that together
199heekd1au_32-8-rgb_front if you want to add any other type of seasoning paprika cayenne pepper anything you can

199heekd1au_38-8-rgb_front i already washed it and everything
199heekd1au_39-8-rgb_front the same pan that we cooked the chicken and beef i washed it and i preheated it and it is nice and hot
199heekd1au_4-8-rgb_front what i want to do is i want to get this yellow bell pepper
199heekd1au_40-8-rgb_front you do not even have to add oil because you stuck the oil on the onion and bell pepper earlier
199heekd1au_41-8-rgb_front and that is how you prepare your vegetables for you vegetarian enchilada
199heekd1au_5-8-rgb_front you can use green or you can use red
199heekd1au_6-8-rgb_front i just like the color of yellow and i am going to use yellow
199heekd1au_7-8-rgb_front what you want to do is you want to cut half down the middle

19fb-dmluqw_0-3-rgb_front so i have a question for you
19fb-dmluqw_1-3-rgb_front what is your score if you get down to no cards left on the board
19fb-dmluqw_10-3-rgb_front and then i will play this five four five six seven six
19fb-dmluqw_11-3-rgb_front i have cleared the board
19fb-dmluqw_12-3-rgb_front i have got no cards left in my down cards
19fb-dmluqw_13-3-rgb_front what is my score
19fb-dmluqw_14-3-rgb_front zero
19fb-dmluqw_15-3-rgb_front i know you can not get that in a real game of golf but you can in golf solitaire
19fb-dmluqw_16-3-rgb_front congratulations on a great score on this hand
19fb-dmluqw_2-3-rgb_front i think i have the answer
19fb-dmluqw_3-3-rgb_front we have gotten down pretty far
19fb-dmluqw_4-3-rgb_front we have got just several cards left on our board and we have we know we are going to get a pretty decent score
19fb-dmluqw_5-3-rgb_front i have got two cards left to play
19fb-dmluqw_6-3-rgb_front there is an eight no help
19fb-dmluqw_7-3-rgb_front and then a four
19fb-dmluqw_8-3-rgb_front you will note all these cards are in sequence so i just need to make sure i play them in the right order to win the hand
19fb-dmluqw_9-3-rgb_front first thing i am going to do is i am going to pull this three off and this four over here
19fvnsoqyiy_0-8-rgb_front alright we are moving along in our sequence for insomnia
19fvnsoqyiy_1-8-rgb_front our next pose is downward facing dog
19fvnsoqyiy_10-8-rgb_front see if you can make it to ten breaths in down dog and when you are done gently drop the knees and rest for a moment in childs pose
19fvnsoqyiy_2-8-rgb_front down dog is one of the most widely recognized yoga poses and it is an all over rejuvenating stretch
19fvnsoqyiy_3-8-rgb_front so what we are going to do is from our hero s pose we are going to place our hands shoulder width apart come into a table top tuck the toes under and exhale as we lift up
19fvnsoqyiy_4-8-rgb_front we are going to lift through the hips through the sitz bones through the tailbone and we are going to drop the heels down to the floor
19fvnsoqyiy_5-8-rgb_front so if you feel like you want to bend your knees go ahead and bend your knees but keep lifting the tailbone up and keep this line from the wrist to the hip straight
19fvnsoqyiy_6-8-rgb_front it is more important to keep that line straight than it is to straighten the knees all the way
19fvnsoqyiy_7-8-rgb_front so if you are here you really want to be here and if that means you want to lift up on your toes than lift up on your toes
19fvnsoqyiy_8-8-rgb_front you can also peddle the feet one at a time shifting through the hips
19fvnsoqyiy_9-8-rgb_front while you are here keep the palms flat on the floor keep the fingers spread keep the shoulder blades wide and inhale and exhale through the nose
19f_ac2f2c8_0-8-rgb_front are you tired of using the eyelash curler everyday and wondering if you can permanently curl your eyelashes
19f_ac2f2c8_1-8-rgb_front i am c g with lips and more
19f_ac2f2c8_10-8-rgb_front the procedure for eyelash perming is finding a professional talking with that person making sure they know what they are going to do
19f_ac2f2c8_11-8-rgb_front have them explain the procedure to you which is when they are going to perm your eyelashes they are going to clean the eye area protect the eye area and have you keep your eyes closed for the full process and procedure
19f_ac2f2c8_12-8-rgb_front they are going to use little tiny rollers there and then they are going to apply the chemical
19f_ac2f2c8_13-8-rgb_front now your eyelashes are going to only stay permed four to eight weeks because eyelashes regrow
19f_ac2f2c8_14-8-rgb_front they come out and they will regrow but that growth does finally end and the perm will end
19f_ac2f2c8_15-8-rgb_front you will have to have it redone again so this is c g with lips and more and the greatest gift is the gift of beauty
19f_ac2f2c8_2-8-rgb_front can you permanently curl your eyelashes
19f_ac2f2c8_3-8-rgb_front that is the question
19f_ac2f2c8_4-8-rgb_front well actually no
19f_ac2f2c8_5-8-rgb_front it is like perming your hair
19f_ac2f2c8_6-8-rgb_front a perm does not last in your hair indefinitely
19f_ac2f2c8_7-8-rgb_front hair grows out your perm grows out
19f_ac2f2c8_8-8-rgb_front also if you do not take care of your hair and the perm it is not going to last as long either
19f_ac2f2c8_9-8-rgb_front same way with your eyelashes
19loes0r7_4_0-8-rgb_front hello i am tim gipson and today i want to talk to you about carpenter safety
19loes0r7_4_1-8-rgb_front so i have got a few things here that we are going to be looking at
19loes0r7_4_10-8-rgb_front they are patterned for comfort
19loes0r7_4_11-8-rgb_front and fit the size and protection your hands and your fingers from nicks and cuts
19loes0r7_4_12-8-rgb_front this is a good step to have
19loes0r7_4_13-8-rgb_front so glasses safety dam
19loes0r7_4_14-8-rgb_front next thing i am going to talk to you about is a table saw when we talk about safety in carpenter tools a table saw is a good place to start
19loes0r7_4_15-8-rgb_front whether it is this is a contractor is saw so it is one of the larger ones but whether you are working with this type or even a small table saw type the most important thing is to make sure you do proper things to ensure your safety
19loes0r7_4_16-8-rgb_front this is the guard now this is a standard guard that comes with any table saw but whenever you are actually getting the act of sawing you want to make sure that is down
19loes0r7_4_17-8-rgb_front now whenever you do something on the blade such as changing the blade you want to make sure that you unplug so never work on any power tool as far as changing the blades unless it is unplugged
19loes0r7_4_18-8-rgb_front here i have a feather fence which is made and the feather fence will allow you to hold pieces against so that will provide extra security in sawing
19loes0r7_4_19-8-rgb_front and then you have other things such as push blocks and a push stick
19loes0r7_4_2-8-rgb_front now the most important thing is that when you are working on any kind of power tools or even hand tools and maybe even something as simple as hammering a nail
19loes0r7_4_20-8-rgb_front these help you to guide things through keeps your fingers away from the cutting surfaces
19loes0r7_4_21-8-rgb_front so just some basic safety tips there and i am tim gipson talking about carpenter safety
19loes0r7_4_3-8-rgb_front the first and most important thing that you can have for safety gear is to have your safety glasses
19loes0r7_4_4-8-rgb_front so and if they are a little dirty you can clean them up but you only have two eyes so you want to make sure you protect them
19loes0r7_4_5-8-rgb_front some other gear that you have if you are dealing with tickly dusty conditions which is you deal with a lot when any time you are doing any kind of construction is the dust mask
19loes0r7_4_6-8-rgb_front now these come in various types this is just your basic dust mask
19loes0r7_4_7-8-rgb_front you have others that actually are upgraded and can have respirators in them or vent valves so that are used for more such things as paint or fine particle sanding such as in drywall
19loes0r7_4_8-8-rgb_front and then the next article is protect your hands
19loes0r7_4_9-8-rgb_front having a good set of gloves these are a heavy duty glove
1a1mzx1-l9g_0-8-rgb_front the next thing you need to do is anchor your oasis into the container and that is what we are going to be using
1a1mzx1-l9g_1-8-rgb_front we are going to use the soft drier oasis for it because the container has a small little step down here with the pedestal we are going to put a hot glob of glue at the base of it and that will fill it in a little bit and then you need to put a top one in and cut the corners off that you measured to stick on the top of that
1a1mzx1-l9g_2-8-rgb_front you do not have to go crazy with the oasis
1a1mzx1-l9g_3-8-rgb_front we tend to do a lot of that here in america but a small piece of oasis is find to use then you take your floral tape and you will run it across in opposite directions on both ends cut it off
1a1mzx1-l9g_4-8-rgb_front you can let it go a little bit beyond it does not matter and then i like to take a piece and make sure it is totally anchored by going all the way around your container and this tends to stick it a lot better when it is stuck to itself so make sure you overlap it
1a1mzx1-l9g_5-8-rgb_front then you can come back and cut your tails off
1a1mzx1-l9g_6-8-rgb_front this will help you anchor your flowers into your container so they will not fall out so the next thing you need to do is go ahead and anchor your oasis down into that container
1a25qzmkliu_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to construct our ears for our animal purses
1a25qzmkliu_1-8-rgb_front we got the panda face done we have our cat face done and now we are going to make the other ear for the cat
1a25qzmkliu_10-8-rgb_front just make sure you are getting to the edge of the fabric and you will know you are catching the wire
1a25qzmkliu_11-8-rgb_front you are going to continue this all the way around the edge of the ear
1a25qzmkliu_12-8-rgb_front so i am going to finish up sewing my ear
1a25qzmkliu_13-8-rgb_front remember just catch that wire that is inside of there
1a25qzmkliu_14-8-rgb_front and once you have gotten down to the edge of the ear i do not want you to to finish this off with a knot
1a25qzmkliu_15-8-rgb_front we are going to attach it right to the purse
1a25qzmkliu_16-8-rgb_front okay so notice there is a little piece of wire there
1a25qzmkliu_17-8-rgb_front i am just going to bend that across so it is nice and neat
1a25qzmkliu_18-8-rgb_front i am going to bring my cat over here
1a25qzmkliu_19-8-rgb_front i am going to attach the ear
1a25qzmkliu_2-8-rgb_front remember you are going to need two pieces of your ear cut out at the same time and your piece of wire that goes them
1a25qzmkliu_20-8-rgb_front i want it right there
1a25qzmkliu_21-8-rgb_front so then i am going to go up from the bottom i am going to hold the ear in place while i attach it to the face
1a25qzmkliu_22-8-rgb_front and just do another running stitch right across
1a25qzmkliu_23-8-rgb_front you are going to go up underneath through the ear attach it to the face and go back down
1a25qzmkliu_24-8-rgb_front up underneath and go all the way across until your ear is attached
1a25qzmkliu_25-8-rgb_front just like that
1a25qzmkliu_3-8-rgb_front so i have my two pieces of felt for my ear and my wire
1a25qzmkliu_4-8-rgb_front place your wire towards the edge of the fabric
1a25qzmkliu_5-8-rgb_front it does not have to be right on the edge just near the edge and place your other piece of felt on top
1a25qzmkliu_6-8-rgb_front you are going to lift this up and hold it with your fingertips together
1a25qzmkliu_7-8-rgb_front you are going to take your needle and thread with the same color as the fabric and you are going to go around that wire so it catches
1a25qzmkliu_8-8-rgb_front you are just going to stitch from the bottom up and you are going to go around the wire so you know that it is being caught by your thread and your stitches
1a25qzmkliu_9-8-rgb_front just keep continuing that and it is just going to make little stitches all the way around
1a368owtj0e_0-3-rgb_front in this clip we are going to drill allister is beak down just slightly
1a368owtj0e_1-3-rgb_front some birds will get malformation of their beak where they do not match up
1a368owtj0e_10-3-rgb_front again this is not hurting him it is something that he needs to be able to eat properly
1a368owtj0e_11-3-rgb_front birds in the wild will rub their beak on either stone or bark to help file it down so that they continue to be able to pick up whatever food they eat and crush it
1a368owtj0e_2-3-rgb_front his matches up pretty well it is just a little long in front so we are going to drill it down
1a368owtj0e_3-3-rgb_front we want to make sure that he is able to eat and crush up his food and pick some up with his beak so that is why we do drill them
1a368owtj0e_4-3-rgb_front for someone just starting to do this you probably want an experienced person around to help you with it as well to make sure they are holding the bird properly
1a368owtj0e_5-3-rgb_front we do not want him fighting while he is having his head handled
1a368owtj0e_6-3-rgb_front just grab around his head and you want to hold the beak closed so that he can not open up and snap at you
1a368owtj0e_7-3-rgb_front again some of this depends on the temperament of your bird if you are able to do this or not
1a368owtj0e_8-3-rgb_front allister is got a pretty good temperament and allows us to handle him and i am able to file down the little bit of overgrowth that he has
1a368owtj0e_9-3-rgb_front you want to smooth it out and round it out so that it is more of the natural formation of the beak
1a8bfsmdcou_0-8-rgb_front here i am holding this species of boa
1a8bfsmdcou_1-8-rgb_front it is called the demeril is boa and its scientific name acrantophis dumerili
1a8bfsmdcou_2-8-rgb_front this is a heavy bodied boa and it is native to madagascar
1a8bfsmdcou_3-8-rgb_front healthy adults can live up to twenty years and they can grow three to four feet in length
1a8bfsmdcou_4-8-rgb_front you can see that they have this beautiful color pattern and these shiny overlapping iridescent scales
1a8bfsmdcou_5-8-rgb_front they have this specific blotchy pattern of lights and shadows because they have evolved to live on the forest floor in madagascar and with this pattern they are able to blend in well with the leaf litter
1a8bfsmdcou_6-8-rgb_front this particular species reaches sexual maturity at three to five years and they are both interesting the male is interesting because he uses two internal hemipenes in his tail to latch onto the female during mating and the female unlike most snakes does not lay eggs
1a8bfsmdcou_7-8-rgb_front she actually can give live birth of up to two to twenty snakes
1a8bfsmdcou_8-8-rgb_front food wise they are constrictors the suffocate their prey which are generally small mammals
1afo2rfl9ow_1-8-rgb_front an espresso is just shots of espresso with cream and sugar or flavor if you like it
1afo2rfl9ow_2-8-rgb_front you always want to freshly grind everything so that there is not grinds sitting in here
1afo2rfl9ow_3-8-rgb_front anything that gets exposed to air or anything climate can change the way your shots pull
1afo2rfl9ow_4-8-rgb_front so your shots should look like this with crema on the top
1afo2rfl9ow_5-8-rgb_front this is called crema
1afo2rfl9ow_6-8-rgb_front and so if they just want a double espresso it would just be two shots and then cream or sugar or flavor in it
1afo2rfl9ow_7-8-rgb_front watch our next segment and i will show you how to make another drink
1aao0rfu9j8_10-8-rgb_front can you take any longer with our drinks
1aao0rfu9j8_11-8-rgb_front actually the bartender is working on that

1aao0rfu9j8_13-8-rgb_front i promise you will they will be out
1aao0rfu9j8_14-8-rgb_front the bartender

1aao0rfu9j8_17-8-rgb_front it is on its way
1aao0rfu9j8_18-8-rgb_front they are working as fast as they can
1aao0rfu9j8_19-8-rgb_front and our food
1aao0rfu9j8_20-8-rgb_front actually i put the order in
1aao0rfu9j8_21-8-rgb_front it should be out in probably minutes
1aao0rfu9j8_22-8-rgb_front minutes
1aao0rfu9j8_23-8-rgb_front make it
1aao0rfu9j8_24-8-rgb_front okay well i will go ahead check on it and see if they can get it out any faster
1aao0rfu9j8_25-8-rgb_front i will be back
1aao0rfu9j8_26-8-rgb_front i will let you know how it is going
1aao0rfu9j8_27-8-rgb_front yeah you do that
1aao0rfu9j8_28-8-rgb_front alright
1aao0rfu9j8_4-8-rgb_front i have to treat them nice do it with a smile do everything i can just to keep the situation calm
1aao0rfu9j8_5-8-rgb_front do what i got to do
1aao0rfu9j8_6-8-rgb_front customers are customers
1aao0rfu9j8_7-8-rgb_front sometimes you get nice ones and sometimes you get not so nice ones
1aao0rfu9j8_8-8-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and check and see how they are doing fill some drinks and hopefully it goes well
1aao0rfu9j8_9-8-rgb_front so guys how is everything going here
1atdcmxgf2q_10-8-rgb_front so lean back into it just a little bit
1atdcmxgf2q_11-8-rgb_front we are opening out squeezing the shoulder blades down the spine
1atdcmxgf2q_12-8-rgb_front all the way back almost bringing the thumbs to your shoulders and then extension comes up
1atdcmxgf2q_13-8-rgb_front we want to keep the resistance here as opposed to letting the shoulders round out and let go of the tension
1atdcmxgf2q_14-8-rgb_front so apply the pressure pull back and engage
1atdcmxgf2q_15-8-rgb_front we are going to do this as a compound exercise so we do lats and traps dropping down into a row
1atdcmxgf2q_16-8-rgb_front so our combination is going to go lat and row
1atdcmxgf2q_17-8-rgb_front when you are doing your lats your elbows open wide
1atdcmxgf2q_18-8-rgb_front when you are doing your row the elbows brush the rib cage
1atdcmxgf2q_19-8-rgb_front if this is too easy for you go up to a red band
1atdcmxgf2q_20-8-rgb_front this is going to add a little bit more resistance and pull
1atdcmxgf2q_21-8-rgb_front if it is still easy for you double up your bands and do both at the same time
1atdcmxgf2q_22-8-rgb_front so now we have got a really heavy load as we are working through those muscles
1atdcmxgf2q_23-8-rgb_front we want to do reps to fatigue on this one
1atdcmxgf2q_24-8-rgb_front if you have just started it is going to be about eight to twelve repetitions
1atdcmxgf2q_25-8-rgb_front if you have been working out for a while really try to fail those muscle groups
1atdcmxgf2q_26-8-rgb_front so your goal is to really pull those shoulders back so we are working deep into your lats
1atdcmxgf2q_27-8-rgb_front the lats look like a triangle upside down
1atdcmxgf2q_28-8-rgb_front so we are trying to get all the way down into the lower portion of your back
1atdcmxgf2q_29-8-rgb_front we are even trying to get up into your trap area
1atdcmxgf2q_30-8-rgb_front so as you are pulling back engage the muscles and then release it
1atdcmxgf2q_31-8-rgb_front sit up really tall and then lean back so that you have got your abs engaged the whole time
1atdcmxgf2q_32-8-rgb_front that is how we do our lat pull down into a row combination using the stability ball or a chair or actually standing up and doing this if you do not have anything to sit on
1atdcmxgf2q_33-8-rgb_front either way will work
1atdcmxgf2q_8-8-rgb_front make sure that the band is secure up top
1atdcmxgf2q_9-8-rgb_front you are going to take your elbows out and all we are going to do is lean back just a little bit so that we are in our motion so that from your shoulders to your hip are actually at a slant and you are not straight up and down with your body
1aug_chpjpk_8-8-rgb_front and there you have setting your face with translucent loose powder with a powder brush
1b-uqjidmkk_0-8-rgb_front alright the next thing you want to do is make yourself more valuable to employers

1b56xmj-j1q_0-8-rgb_front so guys now we are going to do some straight crunches
1b56xmj-j1q_1-8-rgb_front so go ahead align yourself on the floor bring your feet about shoulder width apart have your feet flat on the ground interlace your fingers behind your head and try to relax your head into your hands
1b56xmj-j1q_10-8-rgb_front i want you to exhale and as you crunch up try to lift your knees up too so that your elbows and knees will touch midway
1b56xmj-j1q_11-8-rgb_front again focus on pulling the belly button in towards your spine bring the elbows up to touch the knees and then all the way back down
1b56xmj-j1q_12-8-rgb_front it is really important to come back down to the floor each and every time
1b56xmj-j1q_13-8-rgb_front go for it
1b56xmj-j1q_2-8-rgb_front when you exhale i want you to crunch up i want you to focus on your heart and move in your ribcage towards your pelvis
1b56xmj-j1q_3-8-rgb_front do not worry about coming up too high just work to get your shoulder blades up off the ground and feel that you are engaging your abdominals each and every time
1b56xmj-j1q_4-8-rgb_front it is really important for you just to feel that you are engaging your abdominals
1b56xmj-j1q_5-8-rgb_front we will get plenty of work on the abdominals as we progress
1b56xmj-j1q_6-8-rgb_front now after you do your first set let is see about if we can make them a little harder
1b56xmj-j1q_7-8-rgb_front let is raise your legs up to a degree angle on your hip and your knee and keep your feet off the ground and let is do another set of or here
1b56xmj-j1q_8-8-rgb_front once after you finish that let is make them a little harder again
1b56xmj-j1q_9-8-rgb_front let is put your feet on the ground squeeze your knees together your feet together
1be6jw91tym_0-8-rgb_front hi i am jennifer cail
1be6jw91tym_10-8-rgb_front i am just using a generic environmentally friendly one
1be6jw91tym_11-8-rgb_front you can use pretty much any type that you want as long as it is nice gentle and it does not have any harsh chemicals which it could edge the stove top if you have ceramic or glass
1be6jw91tym_12-8-rgb_front i am going to have some baking soda
1be6jw91tym_13-8-rgb_front this will help as a mild scrubbing agent in case you have any stubborn cooked on stains that you want to get rid of
1be6jw91tym_14-8-rgb_front then last but not least i am going to have some hot water
1be6jw91tym_15-8-rgb_front the nice hot water will help dissolve some of the more stubborn cooked on spots on our stove top
1be6jw91tym_16-8-rgb_front it is all environmentally friendly so let is get started
1be6jw91tym_2-8-rgb_front before we start cleaning let is go over our supplies and detail
1be6jw91tym_3-8-rgb_front first we are going to have a pair of gloves
1be6jw91tym_4-8-rgb_front this will help protect your hands and also allow you to use a hotter temperature of water then otherwise you would be able to with bare hands
1be6jw91tym_5-8-rgb_front you also need a sponge
1be6jw91tym_6-8-rgb_front you need a nice soft sponge you do not want anything that is too abrasive
1be6jw91tym_7-8-rgb_front otherwise it could scratch the cooking surface or different parts of your stove
1be6jw91tym_8-8-rgb_front we are going to use a nice all purpose cleaner
1be6jw91tym_9-8-rgb_front this would be useful when getting out any greasy spots on your stove
1bt5zbdnaom_0_1-3-rgb_front you know a trip to the beach can commonly be associated with a day of fun and enjoyment hi i am captain joe bruni and what i am going to talk about is how to avoid bites from the common sand flea common sand fleas will be active during moist cooler conditions like after it rains
1bt5zbdnaom_2-3-rgb_front if you are going to the beach try to plan your trip accordingly and go during later morning or later afternoon when conditions warm up and sand fleas will not be as active
1bt5zbdnaom_3-3-rgb_front once at the beach try to put a space between your body and the sand such as sitting in a lawn type of chair or sitting on some type of towels
1bt5zbdnaom_4-3-rgb_front sand flea bites commonly occur on the back of the thighs because this is the common exposed area to the sand where the sand fleas will come from to bite the person is legs
1bt5zbdnaom_5-3-rgb_front if sitting on the sand cannot be avoided or a barrier of space cannot be placed between you and the sand then wear some type of longer shorts or swimming type of bathing suit to avoid bites to the back of the legs from the sand flea
1bwklgd8sfa_1-8-rgb_front now we have opened the oven
1bwklgd8sfa_10-8-rgb_front i am going to take the thermometer and i am going to stick it in between the breast and the thigh go all the way in
1bwklgd8sfa_11-8-rgb_front and the proper temperature is degrees for the stuffing and for the turkey
1bwklgd8sfa_12-8-rgb_front so what we are also going to do is diane likes to cover the parts that are browning at the beginning with foil
1bwklgd8sfa_13-8-rgb_front so we cover the wings cook earlier and the legs cook a little earlier
1bwklgd8sfa_14-8-rgb_front we cover up the legs
1bwklgd8sfa_15-8-rgb_front we check them
1bwklgd8sfa_16-8-rgb_front and what we are going to do in this case since we are going to brown it with a glaze later on we are going to put a little aluminum foil over the middle of the turkey too so it does not get brown
1bwklgd8sfa_17-8-rgb_front and we will probably take the aluminum foil off on the front on the top of the breast about a half hour before we start to glaze
1bwklgd8sfa_18-8-rgb_front it is turkey sunscreen
1bwklgd8sfa_19-8-rgb_front turkey sunscreen
1bwklgd8sfa_2-8-rgb_front taking the turkey out
1bwklgd8sfa_20-8-rgb_front ok so diane is now going to put the aluminum foil on the turkey
1bwklgd8sfa_21-8-rgb_front and we will take that off probably the last half hour before we put the glaze on
1bwklgd8sfa_22-8-rgb_front and now our wings our legs and the top of the turkey are protected
1bwklgd8sfa_23-8-rgb_front like sunscreen
1bwklgd8sfa_24-8-rgb_front it will be nice moist and humid in there from the chicken broth inside the pan and the vegetable so it will not be dry
1bwklgd8sfa_25-8-rgb_front ok have a nice trip
1bwklgd8sfa_3-8-rgb_front and we are going to lower the temperature to degrees
1bwklgd8sfa_4-8-rgb_front we are going to roast the turkey for three and a half hours longer
1bwklgd8sfa_5-8-rgb_front and we are going to baste it every thirty minutes and we will rotate a few times
1bwklgd8sfa_6-8-rgb_front until the thermometer inserted in the inner thigh degrees
1bwklgd8sfa_7-8-rgb_front we are adding one carrot chopped coarsely one rib of celery chopped coarsely one medium onion and we are putting it at the bottom of the pan with the stock
1bwklgd8sfa_8-8-rgb_front it is going to soak up the juices
1bwklgd8sfa_9-8-rgb_front we are going to be basting the turkey with the stock in the bottom of the pan
1byz1iht5f0_0-8-rgb_front hi i am stan defreitas mr green thumb for on gardening
1byz1iht5f0_1-8-rgb_front one most import parts of gardening mixes is peralite
1byz1iht5f0_10-8-rgb_front remember degrees like popcorn it is going to be a good mix and a good addition if you want to be a good gardener
1byz1iht5f0_11-8-rgb_front for on gardening i am stan defreitas mr green thumb
1byz1iht5f0_2-8-rgb_front now peralite is a material it is actually has been exploded at about degrees
1byz1iht5f0_3-8-rgb_front when you look at peralite it is a very air like material it is like popcorn
1byz1iht5f0_4-8-rgb_front when it gets exploded at degrees there is really nothing there that is going to be detrimental to your plant
1byz1iht5f0_5-8-rgb_front there is no nematodes there is no disease because this material is sterile
1byz1iht5f0_6-8-rgb_front it also of course lets air flow through your soil so it is great for starting rooting cuttings or if you got it in your potting soils
1byz1iht5f0_7-8-rgb_front you will notice almost every good gardening mix has got some peralite in it and there is a reason for it
1byz1iht5f0_8-8-rgb_front if you want to be a good gardener you are going to have to think about using peralite just like the pros do
1byz1iht5f0_9-8-rgb_front this is the reason that most of their cuttings live because they are often starting off with a very sterile medium
1bo_94urq_q_0-5-rgb_front i am travis steglich with steglich farm supply inc in bartlett texas
1bo_94urq_q_2-5-rgb_front if you will notice that some of these berries are quite red others are still green
1bo_94urq_q_3-5-rgb_front the red ones are ready to be planted out
1bo_94urq_q_4-5-rgb_front as a matter of fact they just fall off when you touch them and these are the ones that you would plant
1bo_94urq_q_5-5-rgb_front they take quite a while to germinate but the seeds are readily germinateable if you keep them in potting soil and you can grow your own asparagus fern for hanging baskets or foundation planted like this
1cr54fshtpe_0-5-rgb_front for our fifth and final line
1cr54fshtpe_1-5-rgb_front you are going to connect the top of the line you just drew at the top of nail
1cr54fshtpe_10-5-rgb_front you may have a little bit of polish there you may not
1cr54fshtpe_11-5-rgb_front if you do just kind of clean it up just a little
1cr54fshtpe_12-5-rgb_front making sure that there is not so much acetone that it causes the entire design to run
1cr54fshtpe_13-5-rgb_front now that is how you do the heart monitor nail design
1cr54fshtpe_2-5-rgb_front you will come down at another forty five degree angle and bring another line down
1cr54fshtpe_3-5-rgb_front this one you can kind of bring off to the end of the nail or you can draw another horizontal line to the middle edge of the finger to look like you are getting ready to start another heartbeat line
1cr54fshtpe_4-5-rgb_front the choice is up to you on either one that you do but you want to do this to all ten
1cr54fshtpe_5-5-rgb_front do not be worried about exactly how tall the lines go not everyone is heartbeat is normal
1cr54fshtpe_6-5-rgb_front not everyone has a strong pulse some people have a real light one
1cr54fshtpe_7-5-rgb_front and again just you can finish it out by doing another horizontal line coming out to the right hand side of the nail
1cr54fshtpe_8-5-rgb_front that is how you do your fifth it can be your fifth or your fifth and sixth line in your heart monitor line
1cr54fshtpe_9-5-rgb_front once you have it done again you will have five or six lines total you will want to make sure that the polish was not stringy in the striping brush if you get any on the side of the finger you can just dip your french manicure brush back in your polish remover and just clean up the sides
1czbtc6jzcs_0-5-rgb_front so moving from the a stance we move into the sumo stance my favorite stance
1czbtc6jzcs_1-5-rgb_front feet are wide apart spine stays tall
1czbtc6jzcs_2-5-rgb_front you can begin with your feet parallel and just kind of sink into it to see how far you can go see how flexible your base is and as you do this then you may want to toes go out a little bit and the toes are out plea style pointed out at an angle then you have a little more flexibility and you can probably take it down a little lower a little deeper
1czbtc6jzcs_3-5-rgb_front you want to always take it to that place where it is comfortable to come back up
1czbtc6jzcs_4-5-rgb_front not that if you are grimacing when you come back up then you know that you have gone down too far so do not take it down as far knowing that as you do this you will continue to gain flexibility and over time you will be able to take it deeper and find that pleasurable point of it so just really relaxing into it keeping your spine long the head relaxed shoulders relaxed just like riding a horse so as you ride the horse let your head nod yes that is the sump stance
1ceapjb3z-w_0-5-rgb_front ok when you have your pattern cut out then we are going to just place it on top of the felt and cut around your pattern
1ceapjb3z-w_1-5-rgb_front now you can sew this by hand
1ceapjb3z-w_2-5-rgb_front i simply do a top stitch all the way around or you can sew it by machine also making a top stitch all the way around and close to the edge
1ceapjb3z-w_3-5-rgb_front ok next we are going to cut out the beak and we are going to use some orange felt for the beak and you want to cut a strip about a half inch wide like this and fold it in half and then round off the top like this
1ceapjb3z-w_4-5-rgb_front ok so i have a strip of orange felt about a half in wide and i fold it in half and rounded the top and now i am going to fold it again and that is the beak and we are going to place that right where the beak should be up in the head between the two pieces of yellow felt like this
1ceapjb3z-w_5-5-rgb_front and then just secure that with a pin and when you sew your mitt together you are going to sew all the way around with just about an eighth of an inch seam allowance all the way around top stitching an eighth of an inch around and you will catch in the beak as you come around
1cja3xzvd0k_1-5-rgb_front talking about how this group that i am involved with here in arizona get started
1cja3xzvd0k_10-5-rgb_front it is a community building here in clarkdale arizona
1cja3xzvd0k_11-5-rgb_front this has worked quite a bit better for us
1cja3xzvd0k_12-5-rgb_front the building is not as heavily used
1cja3xzvd0k_13-5-rgb_front we need to have it not just for when we are performing the play but for rehearsals and building the set and all sorts of things
1cja3xzvd0k_2-5-rgb_front the group was originally started before i was here in town by just a few people who wanted to get together and put on some plays
1cja3xzvd0k_22-5-rgb_front then as you go along you kind of want things to go up a notch or two
1cja3xzvd0k_23-5-rgb_front there is time to do that and we are about where we should be right now
1cja3xzvd0k_3-5-rgb_front they were reforming in a community building over in cottonwood the town next door in the old town section of cottonwood and they named the group old town players
1cja3xzvd0k_4-5-rgb_front they put on productions a year i believe
1cja3xzvd0k_5-5-rgb_front very small productions not very many props not much of a set but they were well received
1cja3xzvd0k_6-5-rgb_front there was really no other live theater here in the verde valley
1cja3xzvd0k_7-5-rgb_front gradually the group got larger and they decided they really should have a board of directors governing things keeping track of the money and planning and that sort of thing so they appointed a board of directors
1cja3xzvd0k_8-5-rgb_front the group continued to grow
1cja3xzvd0k_9-5-rgb_front then it became to difficult to schedule the shows in the building they were in so they moved over here to the clarkdale clubhouse
1cjb2vntyho_1-5-rgb_front most of my life has been on the road with artist like stevie wonder smokey roberson aretha franklin gary moore allan there is a life time and many more
1cjb2vntyho_2-5-rgb_front so i have been on the road and still is on the road all the time so we are going to talk about tips here that would hopefully make your on the road life a little bit more pleasant
1cjb2vntyho_4-5-rgb_front do not leave home with out it a itinerary has a list of places that you are going the time that your are suppose to be there the contacts
1cjb2vntyho_5-5-rgb_front let is say if you are doing let is say that you took a short trip of ten days like from new york from california so you want on the itinerary should be all of the gigs what time they start what time the sound track is the contact person lights load in time the hotel your staying at its phone number and this type of information
1cjb2vntyho_6-5-rgb_front it is absolutely necessary that you have this in your hand and a hard copy and not in your head
1cokus2tolw_0-5-rgb_front so guys the next core exercise that we are going to do is crunches and we are going to start using a stability ball to make the crunches a bit harder more progressive
1cokus2tolw_1-5-rgb_front grab a ball lie down on the mat take your feet and we are going to start with your feet on the ball just like so
1cokus2tolw_10-5-rgb_front touch down touch down touch down touch down touch and down
1cokus2tolw_11-5-rgb_front go for it
1cokus2tolw_2-5-rgb_front we are going to interlace fingers behind your head exhale think about your elbows coming up and then right back down
1cokus2tolw_3-5-rgb_front you will feel that with your legs on the ball you will start to engage your lower abdominals
1cokus2tolw_4-5-rgb_front so you are going to exhale and then back down exhale and back down exhale and back down exhale and back down
1cokus2tolw_5-5-rgb_front each time pull the belly button in towards your spine feel nice and tall through the top of your head and then lie back down
1cokus2tolw_6-5-rgb_front feel the ribcage is working its way to the thighs and then back down
1cokus2tolw_7-5-rgb_front then once after you do a set then we can try a little more progressiveness and we are going to slide the ball away from your body and then we are going to roll the legs in and then back out
1cokus2tolw_8-5-rgb_front so roll the legs in and touch and then back out roll in and out exhale roll in and out exhale roll in and out exhale roll in and out exhale roll in and out exhale roll in and out exhale roll in and out
1cokus2tolw_9-5-rgb_front then once you are done with that if you like to bring your feet down on the ground like we did last week you do the last set of crunches without the ball
1csy0c0r2ei_0-5-rgb_front alright so paddling out
1csy0c0r2ei_1-5-rgb_front the one thing you want to be aware of is just where the surf is breaking
1csy0c0r2ei_10-5-rgb_front but again just once you are once you are paddled past that surf break you are kind of in the clear there is things out there it is safe and a little easier but still watch out for the swell
1csy0c0r2ei_11-5-rgb_front there might be some swell out there
1csy0c0r2ei_12-5-rgb_front there might be some wind and if there is wind kind of go towards that go into it like when one rule of diving is that you always swim against the current so you can kind of swim back with it the same with kayaking
1csy0c0r2ei_13-5-rgb_front go paddle into the wind so you can kind of return with the wind
1csy0c0r2ei_14-5-rgb_front it will make it a lot easier especially when you are tired at the end of it
1csy0c0r2ei_2-5-rgb_front you want to make sure to get past that surf as soon as possible
1csy0c0r2ei_3-5-rgb_front if you get caught in there like when that wave is coming in you can kind of punch right through it if you are running right into it otherwise you can kind of turn sideways and you are going to roll in the surf someplace maybe lose some gear
1csy0c0r2ei_4-5-rgb_front so what you have got to do is just paddle like crazy alternating strokes just one at a time
1csy0c0r2ei_5-5-rgb_front there is nothing too hard about it
1csy0c0r2ei_6-5-rgb_front this paddle here may be a little short for me since i am a big tall guy
1csy0c0r2ei_7-5-rgb_front this would be about six and a half feet long or so seven feet
1csy0c0r2ei_8-5-rgb_front so you might want to have a little bit longer paddle depending on how tall you are or how short you are
1csy0c0r2ei_9-5-rgb_front so maybe talk to like a kayaking instructor paddling instructor of some sort and see what they might recommend for your arm length and your size
1d0elaoidec_1-5-rgb_front to replace the tank we are going to set it right back where it came from and we are going to make sure to line up those bolts holes
1d0elaoidec_2-5-rgb_front when lining up the bolts you want to make sure to be very careful that you do not scratch the porcelain or crack it in any way
1d0elaoidec_3-5-rgb_front you would want to wiggle the tank just a little bit to make sure that it has seated properly you would not want it to leak
1d29htgrrv4_0-5-rgb_front hi i am stan de freitas mr green thumb
1d29htgrrv4_1-5-rgb_front you know if you start most of your house plants you need to have a good watering can and normally you get something like this it is a little bit smaller than some of the watering cans that you have used outside on your vegetable garden area
1d29htgrrv4_10-5-rgb_front these are ideal if you are using a plant food or if you are using some type of fish emulsion
1d29htgrrv4_11-5-rgb_front make sure you use it exactly according to those directions with your indoor watering can
1d29htgrrv4_12-5-rgb_front you will have great results
1d29htgrrv4_13-5-rgb_front for on gardening i am stan de freitas mr green thumb
1d29htgrrv4_2-5-rgb_front something that is easy to work with
1d29htgrrv4_3-5-rgb_front maybe it holds maybe a gallon so it may be half the size of some of the bigger watering cans that you have used outside
1d29htgrrv4_4-5-rgb_front make sure when you have one that you do have something that is going to apply to the end so you can put that gentle stream of water onto your plants
1d29htgrrv4_5-5-rgb_front and you can see here it is got all the little holes so we are going to put a nice little rain drop effect on for our little plants inside
1d29htgrrv4_6-5-rgb_front most of our plants inside really can not take too much water
1d29htgrrv4_7-5-rgb_front if they get too hard a stream well they may have a problem especially true for african violets and aglonemas
1d29htgrrv4_8-5-rgb_front some of those plants if they get too much water in one spot you will start to get into some fungal problems
1d29htgrrv4_9-5-rgb_front make sure you apply this according to label directions when you apply any type of nutrient to your mix
1d3imk0uf_u_0-5-rgb_front the best parts about being a middle school teacher come daily when you meet the students and you get to know them and get to know the challenges they face and their opportunities for success and their abilities
1d3imk0uf_u_6-5-rgb_front i one of the things i really have trouble with is that they start so early i like the staring times better of the elementary schools
1d3imk0uf_u_7-5-rgb_front another thing that i really have difficulty with is trying to monitor all the cell phones and ipods and trying to put up with that and the students and their little arguments back and forth between each other it is just part of the age of middle school
1d3imk0uf_u_8-5-rgb_front also sometimes we deal as a teacher with outdated computers in our classroom outdated materials and books and and sometimes we do have some difficulty getting the supplies that we need
1d4n5vhbmmg_0-5-rgb_front this particular color that we chose for myra is hair actually requires a heat process
1d4n5vhbmmg_1-5-rgb_front so in this process i need to clip the hair off of her neck
1d4n5vhbmmg_10_11_12_13-5-rgb_front she actually processes for ten minutes set my timer and this particular color process requires heat so we are going to put myra under the heat for ten minutes
1d4n5vhbmmg_14-5-rgb_front and as soon as her processing time is over i do not need to do a test strand on this whatsoever
1d4n5vhbmmg_15-5-rgb_front when you are applying color you just follow the direction
1d4n5vhbmmg_16-5-rgb_front and process it as the directions explain for you to do
1d4n5vhbmmg_2-5-rgb_front i am going to cover her neck with a towel
1d4n5vhbmmg_3-5-rgb_front so we do not get hair color all over her skin
1d4n5vhbmmg_4-5-rgb_front we are actually going to cover her with a plastic cap
1d4n5vhbmmg_5-5-rgb_front making sure that the hair is covered but not the skin
1d4n5vhbmmg_6-5-rgb_front because remember every place that hair color touches it is going to stain the skin
1d4n5vhbmmg_7-5-rgb_front so we do not want any extra stained skin
1d4n5vhbmmg_8-5-rgb_front so we have covered her with a plastic bag
1d4n5vhbmmg_9-5-rgb_front we are going to set a timer
1d7qvuvvbpy_0-5-rgb_front hi i am priscilla flynn speaking to you today from yoga sanctuary in windham new hampshire and you can read more about us on our website yogasanctuary com
1d7qvuvvbpy_1-5-rgb_front this clip is going to be about trikonasana which is the sanskrit word for triangle pose
1d7qvuvvbpy_2-5-rgb_front and triangle pose is a great posture to strengthen your legs to lengthen your spine on either side it is a two sided posture a standing posture and it comes nicely after warrior i warrior ii and lateral angle
1d7qvuvvbpy_3-5-rgb_front they all help to warm up for that pose
1d7qvuvvbpy_4-5-rgb_front so you might want to go back and look at those in preparation for trikonasana
1d7qvuvvbpy_5-5-rgb_front triangle your body will be making lots of triangles when you come in to the pose
1d7qvuvvbpy_6-5-rgb_front so it is good as you come in to the pose to know all the different stretches to be aware of the places where your body is stretching along the side body the legs the arms the neck the whole spine
1d7qvuvvbpy_7-5-rgb_front the fabulous pose
1dauip69xtg_1-5-rgb_front what we want to talk about now is setting up the block for a return
1dauip69xtg_10-5-rgb_front if it is that situation it will look like this video demo
1dauip69xtg_11-5-rgb_front they will be going all out to try to get to the kicker
1dauip69xtg_12-5-rgb_front now we will be blocking a little different because we are going to be blocking for the return
1dauip69xtg_13-5-rgb_front if we are going to block for the return we want this guy to get a good punch on me and then we want him to sprint back and turn and find the blockers and set up for the return
1dauip69xtg_14-5-rgb_front it will look something like this video demo
1dauip69xtg_15-5-rgb_front they will sprint back they will turn around and find their defender and then come up and make the block
1dauip69xtg_16-5-rgb_front the most important thing is to get a good hit at the beginning and then sprint back where their return man is turn around and go find your blockers and help him out as much as possible
1dauip69xtg_17-5-rgb_front that is how you set up the block for the return
1dauip69xtg_2-5-rgb_front we have a couple of linemen here to show a couple of different things we can do with a return
1dauip69xtg_3-5-rgb_front first of all it starts with the stance video demo
1dauip69xtg_4-5-rgb_front these guys will get in a good three point stance to be ready to go across the line
1dauip69xtg_5-5-rgb_front there are a couple of things we can do
1dauip69xtg_6-5-rgb_front one we can have these guys rush the kicker
1dauip69xtg_7-5-rgb_front if we know that they have a bad snapper or a slow kicker we might try to get there and block the kick
1dauip69xtg_8-5-rgb_front if we have that on we are not so worried about our return as we are getting in there to block the kick
1dauip69xtg_9-5-rgb_front if we do that you can see that their inside arms which are the inside arms to the ball they will be able to rip through with those explode out and they are going to go get the ball
1dfnccedcyy_1-5-rgb_front we are going to have another great superbowl folks
1dfnccedcyy_10-5-rgb_front the crew my camera girl said just do not eat any cause i want to get my final shot and i am telling you we are all waiting to dig in
1dfnccedcyy_11-5-rgb_front these are just that good
1dfnccedcyy_12-5-rgb_front the fresh pepper and the parsley make it
1dfnccedcyy_13-5-rgb_front do not worry about the cold of the you know that is just going to make it that much better
1dfnccedcyy_14-5-rgb_front what you might want to do now is just drizzle a little bit of olive oil
1dfnccedcyy_15-5-rgb_front a little drizzle of olive oil over the whole top
1dfnccedcyy_16-5-rgb_front very easy not too much
1dfnccedcyy_17-5-rgb_front and that is it man
1dfnccedcyy_2-5-rgb_front here is a little nice little bite size focaccia wedges
1dfnccedcyy_3-5-rgb_front to top off i am just going to use my little dried marjoram
1dfnccedcyy_4-5-rgb_front going to go over the top
1dfnccedcyy_5-5-rgb_front gives it a nice little flavor
1dfnccedcyy_6-5-rgb_front real nice italian also looks good for our garnish
1dfnccedcyy_7-5-rgb_front and i also have our fresh basil and our peppers that i am just going to go over just a little bit with the freshness of this
1dfnccedcyy_8-5-rgb_front alright we are back
1dfnccedcyy_9-5-rgb_front this is the final product
1dgksqnpfqs_10-5-rgb_front so forward forward nice and fluid and back
1dgksqnpfqs_11-5-rgb_front the second phase is both feet together on one corner
1dgksqnpfqs_12-5-rgb_front saw them across center saw them across front then across the front other side then back to center then back and across
1dgksqnpfqs_13-5-rgb_front so again it s one two three four five six
1dgksqnpfqs_14-5-rgb_front then the last phase is one leg at a time
1dgksqnpfqs_15-5-rgb_front i am going to start with my right
1dgksqnpfqs_16-5-rgb_front one two across the top back to center and then switch the feet
1dgksqnpfqs_17-5-rgb_front one two three and now jonesy is going to take the whole entire routine and do it full speed for you
1dgksqnpfqs_18-5-rgb_front so jonesy is going to take it full speed here
1dgksqnpfqs_19-5-rgb_front what we are trying to do is we are trying to balance working as fast as we can with accuracy ok
1dgksqnpfqs_20-5-rgb_front so jonesy whenever you are ready
1dgksqnpfqs_21-5-rgb_front he is going to take it both feet first he is working as fast as he can and as accurate as he can
1dgksqnpfqs_22-5-rgb_front we do it three times with that phase then we will move on to the next phase
1dgksqnpfqs_23-5-rgb_front we will work that three times through
1dgksqnpfqs_24-5-rgb_front again still working as fast as you can but as accurate as you can
1dgksqnpfqs_25-5-rgb_front then once you are done with three times that way then we are going to bring it over to the one foot and again working as fast as you can as accurate as you can too
1dgksqnpfqs_26-5-rgb_front then switch feet
1dgksqnpfqs_27-5-rgb_front three times through for each foot
1dgksqnpfqs_28-5-rgb_front and there you should be ready to go nice and warmed up
1dgksqnpfqs_4-5-rgb_front and we are going to go through three phases of this drill that is going to warm up your body and also work on your coordination and agility
1dgksqnpfqs_5-5-rgb_front i will take it through half speed first and then my partner jonesy is going to take it full speed through so you really get an idea of the intensity and how the should be applied before the workout
1dgksqnpfqs_6-5-rgb_front so the first phase is bilateral using two legs at the same time
1dgksqnpfqs_7-5-rgb_front start on the side the far side of the rectangle
1dgksqnpfqs_8-5-rgb_front jump at the same time to the center land on your toes jump further across land on your toes then return back to center
1dgksqnpfqs_9-5-rgb_front return back across
1dgyl4msyvm_0-5-rgb_front my name is shawn connolly and i am from san fransisco california and i run a program called the sf skate club which teaches kids how to skate
1dgyl4msyvm_1-5-rgb_front now what i am explaining to you today is a backside ollie
1dgyl4msyvm_10-5-rgb_front at first you are going to notice that you may end up pivoting with your front wheels and with your foot on the nose to get yourself all the way around
1dgyl4msyvm_11-5-rgb_front now that is usually how you learn how to do it but eventually you are going to want to ollie and land with out pivoting and land continue rolling fakie
1dgyl4msyvm_12-5-rgb_front now with the backside ollie what makes it different from the front side ollie is that you are going in a direction that you can not see
1dgyl4msyvm_13-5-rgb_front so you are heading around and you can not see which way you are going
1dgyl4msyvm_14-5-rgb_front so after you land you are going to want to turn yourself back around and look in the direction that you are headed rolling fakie
1dgyl4msyvm_15-5-rgb_front my name is shawn connolly and i live in san fransisco california and i run a skateboard program for kids called the sf skate club
1dgyl4msyvm_16-5-rgb_front you can find out more about it at sfskateclub com
1dgyl4msyvm_2-5-rgb_front backside ollie is should not be tried until you learn how to do your straight ollie is very well
1dgyl4msyvm_3-5-rgb_front and you also need to know how to roll backwards just a little bit to be able to do this trick well
1dgyl4msyvm_4-5-rgb_front now you set up pretty much the same as you do for an ollie with your foot planted on the tail because with your toe directly on the tail to get as much pop as possible and you are front foot is going to be right in the middle of the board so that you are able to get a lot of pop and nice control
1dgyl4msyvm_5-5-rgb_front now after that the rest of the backside ollie relies on you following through with your body and your shoulders
1dgyl4msyvm_6-5-rgb_front basically the upper body tells the lower body what to do and how to get over to it
1dgyl4msyvm_7-5-rgb_front so you build up the momentum with your shoulders and you spin around in the air after you have hit your ollie
1dgyl4msyvm_8-5-rgb_front now you are going to want your body to be well beyond the position before you even get the tail on the ground and this is going to help you get all the way around
1dgyl4msyvm_9-5-rgb_front now you will hit your tail follow through with the shoulders and pop your back wheels off the ground and all the way around
1dhasvqymt4_1-5-rgb_front the most important thing before you paint on anything especially metal is to wipe it down with some sort of degreaser precleaner that is what i am going to do right here
1dhasvqymt4_2-5-rgb_front usually you have the wet rag with some kind of solvent on it
1dhasvqymt4_3-5-rgb_front you rub that down pretty good then you take your dry rag rub over that that would pick up the solvent and any degrease and residue that is left on it
1dhasvqymt4_4-5-rgb_front do not forget to wash you hands to
1dhasvqymt4_5-5-rgb_front stay tune for our next segment
1dsshgatogy_0-5-rgb_front of course there are many different washes to jeans and right now i have on something in the middle right
1dsshgatogy_1-5-rgb_front it is kind of like a medium wash and it is faded at the top which i love because it matches everything
1dsshgatogy_10-5-rgb_front she rolled the bottom of her jeans
1dsshgatogy_11-5-rgb_front what i am going to have patricia do is get her bottoms reattached so she does not have to roll them and then she will have the original hem as well
1dsshgatogy_12-5-rgb_front so she has the gray i have the medium and then i am going to show you the dark wash
1dsshgatogy_13-5-rgb_front these are the dark wash now these are like the newest fad because everybody right now is wearing the dark jeans and these are called skinny jeans which i will model for you later
1dsshgatogy_14-5-rgb_front we are not going to get into the skinny right now
1dsshgatogy_15-5-rgb_front but the wash is what you need to look at because the dark goes with a lot of dark colors
1dsshgatogy_16-5-rgb_front now my favorite outfit is actually the dark wash with a white tank top and gold jewelry that is my favorite outfit
1dsshgatogy_17-5-rgb_front that is just like a hot outfit
1dsshgatogy_18-5-rgb_front and you can pair it with patricia is brazilian boots
1dsshgatogy_19-5-rgb_front so whether you go dark light or medium there are fades for everybody there are washes for everybody out there just make sure you have a couple of different washes so you can mix up the shirts that go with them
1dsshgatogy_2-5-rgb_front it is a typical jean color
1dsshgatogy_3-5-rgb_front now you can have dark you can have light you can have medium
1dsshgatogy_4-5-rgb_front now patricia over here has on gray jeans
1dsshgatogy_5-5-rgb_front now these are great because these go with a lot of sweaters i think
1dsshgatogy_6-5-rgb_front you know you can do sweaters you can do blazers like she has on right now
1dsshgatogy_7-5-rgb_front and now gray is actually the new black
1dsshgatogy_8-5-rgb_front everybody is wearing gray lately
1dsshgatogy_9-5-rgb_front and see now patricia if you lift up your leg patricia
1dvnjsslupw_0-5-rgb_front my name is christine marquette and i am a registered dietitian and i am going to talk to you about how reliable are food sensitivity tests
1dvnjsslupw_1-5-rgb_front there are actually several different food sensitivity tests out on the market these days and it really depends on the pathway that they are testing
1dvnjsslupw_10-5-rgb_front the last pathway type four still but it does not use antibodies
1dvnjsslupw_11-5-rgb_front it does not use igg igm none of that
1dvnjsslupw_12-5-rgb_front it actually is mediated
1dvnjsslupw_13-5-rgb_front so what that means is when you have a food that is ingested and your body reacts badly to it it will release your will cause it to release a lot of different mediators things like histamine cytokines leukotrienes things like that that cause inflammation
1dvnjsslupw_14-5-rgb_front so it is still involving your immune system but it is not involving those igg or e or a or m antibodies
1dvnjsslupw_15-5-rgb_front so the food testing how reliable it is depends on what pathway that it is testing
1dvnjsslupw_16-5-rgb_front most of the food sensitivity tests that use igg are not necessarily very reliable for food sensitivity because of the fact that igg can either be protective or it can be pathogenic meaning negative
1dvnjsslupw_17-5-rgb_front and if that is the case you do not really necessarily know if a high level of igg is detected
1dvnjsslupw_18-5-rgb_front is it really bad or is it good
1dvnjsslupw_19-5-rgb_front your body could actually be protecting itself rather than actually having a bad reaction
1dvnjsslupw_2-5-rgb_front for example with your immune system there are typically four recognized immune pathways
1dvnjsslupw_20-5-rgb_front so it is not very reliable in determining your sensitivity to a particular food
1dvnjsslupw_21-5-rgb_front other sensitivity tests that actually just measure mediated release or they measure how much histamine is in your blood that one is going to be a lot more accurate because it is an test
1dvnjsslupw_22-5-rgb_front it is actually seeing what is happened what is you know is there inflammation that is being caused
1dvnjsslupw_23-5-rgb_front it can detect those types of things so the tests are much more accurate as far as sensitivity tests go
1dvnjsslupw_3-5-rgb_front type one is what is referred to as ige or immunoglobulin e response and in that one it is actually a true food allergy
1dvnjsslupw_4-5-rgb_front when ige antibodies are released in response to your particular food you react almost immediately with things like hives swelling difficulty breathing
1dvnjsslupw_5-5-rgb_front that is one pathway
1dvnjsslupw_6-5-rgb_front the second pathway is also but rather than ige it could be a different antibody igm iga something like that
1dvnjsslupw_7-5-rgb_front type three is a delayed sensitivity reaction so it is not immediate in the sense that allergy is
1dvnjsslupw_8-5-rgb_front this one could take hours to days for it to show up and it is a different pathway using different antibodies
1dvnjsslupw_9-5-rgb_front this one uses igg antibodies
1dbtawqof0m_0-5-rgb_front ok what we are getting ready to do now is to start our first braid
1dbtawqof0m_1-5-rgb_front and just like and french braid you are going to grab a piece of hair only this time it is a much smaller amount because we are working with less hair and you are going to divide it up in three is
1dbtawqof0m_2-5-rgb_front and when it comes to any type of stylized braiding generally we do an out braid so we are going to go under and go under and i am going to go under one more time
1dbtawqof0m_3-5-rgb_front i like to leave it with a good start so i can get a good hold on it
1dbtawqof0m_4-5-rgb_front get all the hair out the way just grab anther little piece and add it there and go underneath
1dbtawqof0m_5-5-rgb_front now when it comes to these smaller braids you really want to make sure you have got a good grip on it to keep your braid in line
1dbtawqof0m_6-5-rgb_front go ahead and grab that piece and go under and try to keep your strand separate
1dbtawqof0m_7-5-rgb_front with longer hair it takes a bit more work because you are really got a bit further way to stretch to separate your hair all the way out
1dbtawqof0m_8-5-rgb_front ok and just keep running your fingers through the hair to keep it untangled and you will just keep adding hair to it as we move along down the braid
1dbtawqof0m_9-5-rgb_front just continue alternating sides adding hair and crossing underneath until we get all the way to the bottom
1dd3hplgdww_0-5-rgb_front as you can see the stance for a man is a different position
1dd3hplgdww_1-5-rgb_front they do not pull the feet in like the women they leave the basic open so that first position is an open position again the toes are diagonal not pointing straight ahead but with about a foot of distance between each other
1dd3hplgdww_10-5-rgb_front keep their legs inside the legs of their chair
1dd3hplgdww_11-5-rgb_front the knees are open and the hands just rest on the thigh
1dd3hplgdww_12-5-rgb_front as you can see they do not need to bring them to the side that is more feminine
1dd3hplgdww_13-5-rgb_front so i would like for the men just to be relaxed with their perfect posture and rest their hands on the top of the thighs of their legs
1dd3hplgdww_14-5-rgb_front so now that you have seen how a man should sit into a chair just a little bit different than how ladies do they do not keep their knees together they can keep them apart about a foot apart
1dd3hplgdww_15-5-rgb_front they let their hands just rest on their thighs and by still attaining perfect posture keeping the shoulders down slightly back but relaxed and the stomach muscles in again when you are sitting keep your stomach muscles in so that your chest expands and you feel relaxed and comfortable
1dd3hplgdww_16-5-rgb_front this is exactly what men should do before they begin to get up
1dd3hplgdww_17-5-rgb_front but as they get up keep in mind it is not one movement
1dd3hplgdww_18-5-rgb_front you want to gently slide to the edge of your hair and then with a straight back use just the knees to pop you back up out of the chair in order to move on or walk away
1dd3hplgdww_2-5-rgb_front you are able to hit first position or what we like to call basic in modeling
1dd3hplgdww_3-5-rgb_front what i would like to do from this position is show the men how they can go ahead and sit down in a professional way
1dd3hplgdww_4-5-rgb_front the best thing for them to do is move into their chair where their leg also touches the seat of the chair and as they go down they do not have to worry about their knees touching
1dd3hplgdww_5-5-rgb_front so as they sit down again keeping perfect posture they use their hands to guide them to the edge of their seat not worrying about their knees being together and they move into the middle of the chair keeping or adjusting if you would like to say the basic stance for a man
1dd3hplgdww_6-5-rgb_front it is the same sitting as it is standing
1dd3hplgdww_7-5-rgb_front one thing that is really important for men to remember while they are sitting is that their legs stay positioned inside the legs of the chair
1dd3hplgdww_8-5-rgb_front whatever chair they choose to sit in that is the amount of space that they should use
1dd3hplgdww_9-5-rgb_front it is etiquette it is professional and that is the amount of space that they should use for their chair
1df0ad8axue_0-5-rgb_front i am going to discuss the loop in parts
1df0ad8axue_1-5-rgb_front the first part to the loop is the initiation of it
1df0ad8axue_10-5-rgb_front once my boat gets in the water deeply i am going to lean back reach up to the sky and try and get as much lift as i can
1df0ad8axue_2-5-rgb_front the initiation of the loop is entering your boat into the hole trying to pop your boat up into the air as much as possible
1df0ad8axue_3-5-rgb_front the placement of your initiation is really important
1df0ad8axue_4-5-rgb_front i want to initiate my bow right here
1df0ad8axue_5-5-rgb_front right there is the seam between the green water and the foam
1df0ad8axue_6-5-rgb_front if i can get my bow there it is going to get a nice pop up into the air
1df0ad8axue_7-5-rgb_front i do not want to initiate farther upstream into that area
1df0ad8axue_8-5-rgb_front if i hit the green water more i am more likely to get rejected back
1df0ad8axue_9-5-rgb_front once my bow goes into the seam i am going to throw my weight forward hard in order to push the boat into the water deeply
1dgrpcy65mk_1-5-rgb_front today we are making cookie rounds a wonderful holiday treat
1dgrpcy65mk_10-5-rgb_front we are just going to simply roll the cookie around the spoon
1dgrpcy65mk_11-5-rgb_front and then set it aside for just a few seconds to let it take to that shape
1dgrpcy65mk_12-5-rgb_front and that is why you want two or three of these so you do not have to wait around
1dgrpcy65mk_13-5-rgb_front and again flop it over and simply roll and its ok you are going to get chocolate over the paper that is why i did that and there is no real good way to do that
1dgrpcy65mk_14-5-rgb_front now this one is already starting to crack and harden around the edges so we may have to put these cookies back in the oven for a few more seconds
1dgrpcy65mk_15-5-rgb_front back in the oven for a few seconds
1dgrpcy65mk_16-5-rgb_front this is the one we just did
1dgrpcy65mk_17-5-rgb_front we will take the spoon out go get our cookies and there we have it
1dgrpcy65mk_18-5-rgb_front let those cool and we will arrange them nicely
1dgrpcy65mk_19-5-rgb_front share these with a friend and a cup of hot coffee
1dgrpcy65mk_2-5-rgb_front now that we have our wooden spoons and we have lightly oiled them it is time to take our cookies and wrap them or roll them rather around our wooden spoons until they set and then put them on a wire rack
1dgrpcy65mk_3-5-rgb_front while they are in there for a few seconds go ahead and take another piece of wax paper and place it here
1dgrpcy65mk_4-5-rgb_front this is where we will work our cookies
1dgrpcy65mk_5-5-rgb_front you will also want your cooling rack
1dgrpcy65mk_6-5-rgb_front grab your cookies grab your wooden spoon
1dgrpcy65mk_7-5-rgb_front and you will want to work not right on the edge because the spoon gets too heavy so but where you can roll it
1dgrpcy65mk_8-5-rgb_front so grab a cookie and you can usually grab it without the spatula if it sticks a little bit just go ahead and get your little metal spatula a loosen it again
1dgrpcy65mk_9-5-rgb_front we are just going to get that in the picture
1e1vnnehwde_0-5-rgb_front hi i am amelia and i am going to show you how to use a hot hair styling brush to curl your hair
1e1vnnehwde_1-5-rgb_front these are great because what they do is they bring a brush and a blow dryer and put it into one unit
1e1vnnehwde_10-5-rgb_front you can continue to do this around your head and this will give you a great volume and body without having to use a brush and a blow dryer at the same time
1e1vnnehwde_11-5-rgb_front and this is how you use your hot hair curl dryer
1e1vnnehwde_2-5-rgb_front so it is a lot easier for you to use at home
1e1vnnehwde_3-5-rgb_front basically what you are going to do is make sure you have got some styling product on your hair your hair is not necessarily have to be completely wet it can just be slightly damp like the model
1e1vnnehwde_4-5-rgb_front you want to turn it on and really let it heat up and you see how i am twisting it the same way that your designer would in the salon
1e1vnnehwde_5-5-rgb_front except they would be using a brush and a drier
1e1vnnehwde_6-5-rgb_front so you only use one hand instead of two
1e1vnnehwde_7-5-rgb_front and you really want that strand to heat up and dry
1e1vnnehwde_8-5-rgb_front you can also put it on low if you feel like that gives you a little bit more control
1e1vnnehwde_9-5-rgb_front and remove it off of the hot hair dryer and there you have got your curl
1e4at0mj-v4_0-5-rgb_front so before we start practicing letters we need to establish the size of the letters
1e4at0mj-v4_1-5-rgb_front and as i mentioned in the very beginning uncial hand has a particular proportion
1e4at0mj-v4_2-5-rgb_front the proportion is what determines the shape and width of the letters and for uncial hand we are going to describe the size of the letters or the height of the letters in terms of the tool that we are writing with
1e4at0mj-v4_3-5-rgb_front that is called pen scale
1e4at0mj-v4_4-5-rgb_front and if i make four or four and a half of the largest strokes that i can with this pen it is going to give me a interval
1e4at0mj-v4_5-5-rgb_front and into that interval is where i am going to fit the letters
1e4at0mj-v4_6-5-rgb_front so we say that uncial hand is about three and a half to four pen widths in height
1e4at0mj-v4_7-5-rgb_front so if we count these one two three four pen widths i am working at a four pen width scale
1e4at0mj-v4_8-5-rgb_front now conveniently because my pen is an eighth of an inch this is going to equal to a half inch in height for these letters
1e70qw68azw_0-5-rgb_front one of the traditional origami pieces is the lily
1e70qw68azw_1-5-rgb_front and my name is robert segundo and today i am going to teach you how to do this
1e70qw68azw_10-5-rgb_front squash fold it like so and now after all your sides are folded what you are going to do is basically going to rabbit ear these sections by taking and folding the bottom corners in to your center line then opening back up and folding up like so all the way til you form this diamond shape here
1e70qw68azw_11-5-rgb_front what you are going to do is you are going to basically do that on all sides
1e70qw68azw_12-5-rgb_front just going to go ahead and use my to go ahead and do that real quickly
1e70qw68azw_13-5-rgb_front there we go
1e70qw68azw_14-5-rgb_front and once you have done that you just take and fold all your legs down like so
1e70qw68azw_15-5-rgb_front open it up here where is it there it is
1e70qw68azw_16-5-rgb_front hold it down like so
1e70qw68azw_17-5-rgb_front hold it down like so
1e70qw68azw_18-5-rgb_front then we are going to do is this is your open end up here so what we are going to do is at your closed end with the bottom here we are just going to take and we are going to fold each of these petal corners over to the center like so
1e70qw68azw_19-5-rgb_front so do it on all four sides turn it up all four sides
1e70qw68azw_2-5-rgb_front what i am going to do is i am just going to unfold this guy here and this already good and
1e70qw68azw_20-5-rgb_front like so
1e70qw68azw_21-5-rgb_front now that all of these are folded like this you are just going to take your petal that is what this is right here you are going to fold it all the way down where you leave those guys sticking up like that flip it over
1e70qw68azw_22-5-rgb_front do it on all four sides
1e70qw68azw_23-5-rgb_front then basically after it is done all you got to do is release your petals then you open all four of them up your water lily just takes shape all on its own
1e70qw68azw_24-5-rgb_front well not really a water lily but just your lily
1e70qw68azw_25-5-rgb_front there you have it your simple lily
1e70qw68azw_26-5-rgb_front play around with the origami have fun and enjoy
1e70qw68azw_3-5-rgb_front and make it easy and we can run through this real quick
1e70qw68azw_4-5-rgb_front so what we are going to do is we are really going to start off with the traditional water bomb base and if you really do not know how to do that there is other videos that i have out that you can go and look and it is going to look basically look like this
1e70qw68azw_5-5-rgb_front and then from there what you are going to do is you are going to take the legs of your water bomb base you are going to open it and squash fold it like so
1e70qw68azw_6-5-rgb_front and you are going to do that to all four sides
1e70qw68azw_7-5-rgb_front oops
1e70qw68azw_8-5-rgb_front there you go
1e70qw68azw_9-5-rgb_front just open this up and this squash fold it open it back
1ec-cm1w4sq_0-5-rgb_front so next thing you are going to do now that we have evened out her skin tone and gave her the appropriate coverage with the concealer and foundation is we are going to use a really soft pale peachy blush to give her a nice natural pop of color on her cheeks
1ec-cm1w4sq_1-5-rgb_front i am going to use a contoured brush which has more of an angle to it so it makes it really easy to get in their and contour the cheek bone
1ec-cm1w4sq_2-5-rgb_front so i am just going to take a little bit of this and have her smile for me you see the apple of the cheek which is the area right there that you get when you smile that is where you want to concentrate most of your color and then you can sweep it really lightly up the cheek bone
1ec-cm1w4sq_3-5-rgb_front but most of your color should be concentrated right to the apple of the cheek because that is where you would naturally flush anyway when you naturally flush you get that nice little pop of color right there on the apple of the cheek
1ec-cm1w4sq_4-5-rgb_front you do not necessarily flush all the way up into your hairline so just concentrate most of the color right there on the apple turn and face me a little bit
1ec-cm1w4sq_5-5-rgb_front so again we are concentrating most of the color to the apple of the cheek and just lightly going up the cheek bone
1ec-cm1w4sq_6-5-rgb_front when you have an angled brush like this it just makes it really easy to just to kind of glide right up that cheek bone so you can get a nice natural contour
1ec-cm1w4sq_7-5-rgb_front you can see just doing it that way gives her a just a natural look of color just looks like she was naturally maybe out for a run or did a little bit of exercise so she has a just a nice natural color right on the apples of the cheek it is not to heavy it is not to dark and this is what you would want for a really nice natural daytime look
1ec-cm1w4sq_8-5-rgb_front so that is how you would want to apply some blush in a peachy tone for a natural daytime look
1eegqe9w4k8_10-3-rgb_front hooping takes a lot of room
1eegqe9w4k8_11-3-rgb_front if you have stuff around you when you are hooping there is a really good chance that you are going to break something
1eegqe9w4k8_12-3-rgb_front make sure that you clear a space and it is nice and comfortable with room for you to hoop around your waist as well as taking it up and over your head
1eegqe9w4k8_13-3-rgb_front the last thing we recommend after you try a move go ahead and put on your favorite song and rock out
1eegqe9w4k8_14-3-rgb_front music inspires fun and creativity
1eegqe9w4k8_15-3-rgb_front alright let is do it
1eegqe9w4k8_6-3-rgb_front you are also going to want some comfortable yoga type clothes
1eegqe9w4k8_7-3-rgb_front tank tops are great because sometimes the hoop can get a little bit slippery so tank tops are awesome
1eegqe9w4k8_8-3-rgb_front definitely
1eegqe9w4k8_9-3-rgb_front you need to clear a space
1ehuon_w9c8_0-3-rgb_front next we are going to talk about maintenance
1ehuon_w9c8_1-3-rgb_front maintenance for all the different dread types is different
1ehuon_w9c8_2-3-rgb_front we could for maintenance for a comb twist is going to be a lot more because a comb twist is basically using gel and creating coils with your hair
1ehuon_w9c8_3-3-rgb_front so to maintain that is going to come out pretty quick
1ehuon_w9c8_4-3-rgb_front you are going to lay on it you might get it wet whatever
1ehuon_w9c8_5-3-rgb_front even if you try and really keep it tied down you have to have a comb twist done within two weeks
1ehuon_w9c8_6-3-rgb_front because first of all you want your scalp cleaned within that time and second of all it is going to be messed up
1epjuu2mn6q_1-5-rgb_front the next thing that we are going to talk about is car seats and the how to with those
1epjuu2mn6q_2-5-rgb_front what we have here is a graco harness car seat
1epjuu2mn6q_3-5-rgb_front we had the graco infant car seat which was wonderful and we just decided to do the toddler car seat with graco as well
1eqgj8sykug_0-5-rgb_front hi in this segment we are going to talk about a bash
1eqgj8sykug_1-5-rgb_front and the way i do bashes is because i am right handed i use the counterclockwise spin to do a bash
1eqgj8sykug_10-5-rgb_front the fat part of your hand so it does not hurt
1eqgj8sykug_11-5-rgb_front if you go and hit it with your fingers it is going to give you a little bit of pain and it will not put as much spin on it
1eqgj8sykug_12-5-rgb_front so here around the outside and really try to crank that spin up
1eqgj8sykug_13-5-rgb_front one more time
1eqgj8sykug_14-5-rgb_front here bash
1eqgj8sykug_2-5-rgb_front now a bash is different than a brush because you are actually hitting it a lot harder and a bash is really intended to put to a lot more spin on the frisbee
1eqgj8sykug_3_4-5-rgb_front so if the frisbee is going counterclockwise position and it is here you strike it right on the side so you are basically coming on you are going to cup your hand a little bit
1eqgj8sykug_5-5-rgb_front a lot of people think you are hitting it from this side but you are not
1eqgj8sykug_6-5-rgb_front you are actually hitting it from the far side hitting it on the edge and really trying to put more spin on it
1eqgj8sykug_7-5-rgb_front so there is the counter spin the set up the bash the set the bash the tip bash bash and it increases the spin
1eqgj8sykug_8-5-rgb_front again you want to hit it with the palm
1eqgj8sykug_9-5-rgb_front the meaty part
1ev7at_lbno_1-5-rgb_front after you have learned your all girl stunts it is really fun to move into partner stunts
1ev7at_lbno_10-5-rgb_front you can hold wherever you feel comfortable and wherever your partner feels comfortable
1ev7at_lbno_11-5-rgb_front do not go too high up because your grip is not going to be as good
1ev7at_lbno_12-5-rgb_front and really make sure you have got a firm grip with your thumb in the back your forefingers in the front
1ev7at_lbno_13-5-rgb_front now the way you get into a stunt the back partner which will be the male is in charge and he is going to do the same call that we always do to get into a stunt which is ready one two
1ev7at_lbno_14-5-rgb_front now you guys both need to be on the same page here
1ev7at_lbno_15-5-rgb_front as the flier and the female you are going to dip on his ready one two
1ev7at_lbno_16-5-rgb_front so you are going to go down bend at the knees and really push yourself up off of his arms
1ev7at_lbno_17-5-rgb_front it is half your job to get in the air half his job
1ev7at_lbno_18_19_20_21-5-rgb_front so do not slack off nobody is going to want to stunt with you make sure you jump it is really important do not just let the guy take you you really need to push yourself off the ground
1ev7at_lbno_2-5-rgb_front now a partner stunt group is going to consist of a male a female and a spotter who can be either sex as long as they are tall enough to catch where the bases height is
1ev7at_lbno_22-5-rgb_front that is half the momentum
1ev7at_lbno_23-5-rgb_front now men the most important thing you need to remember as you are holding your partner is waist ready one two do not bend forward and lift her up with your back because she is not going anywhere
1ev7at_lbno_3-5-rgb_front so now that we have got our two people that we need involved you really need to learn how to do your job
1ev7at_lbno_34-5-rgb_front girls your legs are going to be burning guys your arms are going to be burning
1ev7at_lbno_35-5-rgb_front it is a really good drill
1ev7at_lbno_36-5-rgb_front now two of the most basic partner stunts are a chair sit
1ev7at_lbno_37-5-rgb_front now for a chair sit we are going to start with our basic toss
1ev7at_lbno_38-5-rgb_front females your position is going to look like this sitting
1ev7at_lbno_39-5-rgb_front now males you are going to be holding the girls bottom ankle this is kind of like your steering shift
1ev7at_lbno_4-5-rgb_front now if you are a female you are going to be a flier
1ev7at_lbno_40-5-rgb_front and this hand is going to be underneath her bottom like this one side
1ev7at_lbno_41-5-rgb_front so you are going to have a hand her you are going to have the other hand here
1ev7at_lbno_42-5-rgb_front girls it is really your job to sit back into the guy is hand
1ev7at_lbno_43-5-rgb_front get comfortable
1ev7at_lbno_44-5-rgb_front guys it is really important when she hits that peak you have got to get this hand under cause she is going to fall on it
1ev7at_lbno_45-5-rgb_front keep your arm stiff
1ev7at_lbno_46-5-rgb_front make sure you can hold her up
1ev7at_lbno_47-5-rgb_front the next stunt we are going to do is toss hands similar to an all girl stunt but you need to throw her up there
1ev7at_lbno_48-5-rgb_front so basically we are going to go from here do our toss you need to complete all the way up to the ceiling even though we are only going to catch her right here
1ev7at_lbno_49-5-rgb_front it is really important for momentum
1ev7at_lbno_5-5-rgb_front for the stance you and your partner are going to be about a foot away with the male in the back
1ev7at_lbno_50-5-rgb_front girls you need to keep your eyes forward and basically you can not see where your feet are going to land
1ev7at_lbno_51-5-rgb_front the most important thing is just to jump
1ev7at_lbno_52-5-rgb_front though guys you really have to catch her feet
1ev7at_lbno_53-5-rgb_front if they are out a little further pull them in and you are going to rest them right her by your shoulders
1ev7at_lbno_6-5-rgb_front females your arms are going to go behind you grasping like this onto your partner is wrists
1ev7at_lbno_7-5-rgb_front now males you are going to have your stance in the back
1ev7at_lbno_8-5-rgb_front and you are going to be holding your partner is waist
1ev7at_lbno_9-5-rgb_front now this is really important to do
1evfv97x6ia_0-5-rgb_front hi this is aaron hale with fitness for life and i am here to talk to you about the proper way to use a treadmill
1evfv97x6ia_1-5-rgb_front the first things first when approaching the treadmill we want to make sure the treadmill is not running
1evfv97x6ia_10-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that you have your seatbelt on before you begin to drive
1evfv97x6ia_11-5-rgb_front the same principle applies when using the treadmill
1evfv97x6ia_12-5-rgb_front make sure that you have your safety clip attached somewhere very securely either to a piece of clothing to your person and then begin working and doing your work on the treadmill
1evfv97x6ia_13-5-rgb_front try not to push yourself too hard
1evfv97x6ia_14-5-rgb_front everybody should kind of be aware of what their limits are as far as walking or running or doing any sort of interval work
1evfv97x6ia_15-5-rgb_front mind your limits
1evfv97x6ia_16-5-rgb_front try not to push them
1evfv97x6ia_17-5-rgb_front we always want to push our limits but we do not want to go past what our capabilities are so that is another safety aspect that we really need to take into consideration
1evfv97x6ia_18-5-rgb_front push your limits but also know them and respect them
1evfv97x6ia_19-5-rgb_front this is aaron hale at fitness for life
1evfv97x6ia_2-5-rgb_front we do not want to step on to a treadmill that somebody has left running and has not had the safety clip on or it is still on
1evfv97x6ia_20-5-rgb_front thank you for joining us
1evfv97x6ia_3-5-rgb_front once we have gotten to the treadmill we are ready to work
1evfv97x6ia_4-5-rgb_front just step on to the treadmill go ahead and there should be a quick start or some sort of start button that will inform you how to get started on the treadmill
1evfv97x6ia_5-5-rgb_front most treadmills come with speed control so you can dictate the speed and the pace at which you are walking running and doing other sort of work in
1evfv97x6ia_6-5-rgb_front also a lot of treadmills nowadays come with if you do want to do a program or something like that a lot of these treadmills nowadays have a lot of preset programs and you can find those anywhere on the display
1evfv97x6ia_7-5-rgb_front the main thing with a treadmill is to always make sure that you are using the safety clip
1evfv97x6ia_8-5-rgb_front any treadmill should come equipped with one
1evfv97x6ia_9-5-rgb_front make sure that when you do before you get on to the treadmill it is just like getting into your car
1ey3nxnhhhc_0-5-rgb_front this next position is often referred to as alligator
1ey3nxnhhhc_1-5-rgb_front we are going to be moving down to our back
1ey3nxnhhhc_10-5-rgb_front deep breath in and exhale both legs go slowly over to the left side keeping the right hip on the floor
1ey3nxnhhhc_11-5-rgb_front you can look to the right side if it helps you keep the right shoulder on the floor
1ey3nxnhhhc_12-5-rgb_front inhale just exhale relax
1ey3nxnhhhc_13-5-rgb_front deep breath in and exhale and again using your breath and your obliques and you can use the opposite hand to assist bringing both legs back to center
1ey3nxnhhhc_14-5-rgb_front and that is your alligator
1ey3nxnhhhc_15-5-rgb_front you can bring the knees into the chest wrapping your hands around your legs
1ey3nxnhhhc_16-5-rgb_front just relax and loosen the spine and feel the effects of the pose
1ey3nxnhhhc_2-5-rgb_front so from a seated position you are just going to swing your legs over and we are going to gently one leg at a time lie yourself down and you can place your hands under your leg if you would like
1ey3nxnhhhc_3-5-rgb_front just rolling all the way down nice and gently
1ey3nxnhhhc_4-5-rgb_front we are going to take the arms out to your side palms up perpendicular to your body
1ey3nxnhhhc_5-5-rgb_front both legs are going to come up toward the ceiling and we are going to take a deep breath
1ey3nxnhhhc_6-5-rgb_front inhale and as you exhale slowly taking both legs over to the right and if you would like to help keep the left shoulder on the floor you can look to the left side or else you can just keep your head to the center
1ey3nxnhhhc_7-5-rgb_front just taking deep breaths as you hold this pose trying to keep your feet close to your hand or wrist
1ey3nxnhhhc_8-5-rgb_front inhaling exhaling and trying to press that left hip close to the floor and then you are going to use your breath and your obliques exhale slowly bring both legs back to center
1ey3nxnhhhc_9-5-rgb_front then repeat the same thing on the other side
1eyhtlj97b8_0-5-rgb_front so in our view today we have covered which nutrients are appropriate for energy metabolism
1eyhtlj97b8_1-5-rgb_front we talked about protein carbohydrates and fats being the main energy source that are main nutrients for energy metabolism
1eyhtlj97b8_2-5-rgb_front we talked about the supporting nutrients of the vitamins and minerals that help support to metabolize the protein carbohydrates and fats for energy
1eyhtlj97b8_3-5-rgb_front we also talked about some of the sources the food guide pyramid and getting a variety of foods in our food guide pyramid
1eyhtlj97b8_4-5-rgb_front we will give you all the nutrients that you need for that energy metabolism we talked about how you can determine the amounts that you need of all of those nutrients
1eyhtlj97b8_5-5-rgb_front we touched on supplements and we talked about the benefits of getting a proper diet for your energy metabolism
1eyhtlj97b8_6-5-rgb_front now remember that these segments are really for informational purposes if you are having any complications with your energy or you feel that your energy metabolism is really low
1eyhtlj97b8_7-5-rgb_front it is best that you consult a dietitian or you can contact me on my website www lifestillnutrition or please consult your physician
1eaphq-7csa_10-5-rgb_front generally i am a fan of just going ahead and getting the cage right away
1eaphq-7csa_11-5-rgb_front that way you have got it you are ready for it and you do not have to worry about buying it later down the road
1eaphq-7csa_12-5-rgb_front never expect to be in money later on to be able to afford that
1eaphq-7csa_13-5-rgb_front if you can not afford the cage now do not get the snake
1eaphq-7csa_6-5-rgb_front a gallon is the absolute smallest i would go
1eaphq-7csa_7-5-rgb_front a spotted python is only going to reach to feet long they do not get large by any stretch of the imagination so they are a nice small snake
1eaphq-7csa_8-5-rgb_front an enclosure this size would be just fine though a long which would be just a little bit longer than this guy would probably be just a little bit better for an adult
1eaphq-7csa_9-5-rgb_front so you know if you have that at your access at your pet store or whatever you might want to go ahead and buy the long right off the bat and just get it done and over with
1eeikjudnao_1-5-rgb_front okay now i am going to show you the materials that you need to assemble to make this project
1eeikjudnao_10-5-rgb_front and you need four millimeter five millimeter crystals depending on the size is really a question of taste
1eeikjudnao_11-5-rgb_front these happen to austrian crystals
1eeikjudnao_12-5-rgb_front you can use swarovski crystals and i would say the color of the crystal depends on the color combination you are going to chose for you necklace
1eeikjudnao_13-5-rgb_front you need four jump rings
1eeikjudnao_14-5-rgb_front smallest jump rings these are about eight millimeters
1eeikjudnao_15-5-rgb_front and four rounded head pins and you need of course swarovski crystals the size is known as pp
1eeikjudnao_16-5-rgb_front and if you see these crystals are going to be inserted in these little holes here and the one in the middle is actually a little bit bigger
1eeikjudnao_17-5-rgb_front so if you really want to be exact this is an eighteen pp hole but the does fit in it it is just a little bit smaller
1eeikjudnao_18-5-rgb_front and you need and antique cooper lobster clasp
1eeikjudnao_19-5-rgb_front and once you have got all of these products assembled then you are ready to begin
1eeikjudnao_2-5-rgb_front it is probably the most complicated part of it because you need quite a few different things
1eeikjudnao_20-5-rgb_front in addition to the wire cutters that you need for cutting the chain you need two pairs of flat nose pliers and a pair of needle nose pliers in order to work with the necklace
1eeikjudnao_21-5-rgb_front you will need special glue called strass which is for glueing on the crystals
1eeikjudnao_22-5-rgb_front and it is advisable to have a at your disposal and a little bit of water
1eeikjudnao_3-5-rgb_front you need a sixteenth centimeters of antique cooper chain
1eeikjudnao_4-5-rgb_front it is a small chain it is not too bulky
1eeikjudnao_5-5-rgb_front you could use that is about four inches obviously this depends on how long you wish to wear your necklace so you could start with it a little bit longer then cut it shorter at the end
1eeikjudnao_6-5-rgb_front you cut chain chain is sold in long spools and you cut it using a pair of wire cutters
1eeikjudnao_7-5-rgb_front never cut chain with scissors because it breaks the scissors that is by the way
1eeikjudnao_8-5-rgb_front and then you need three flower pieces which are with the holes that you embellish
1eeikjudnao_9-5-rgb_front you can get these from specialized jewelry stores
1eidpmniaje_0-5-rgb_front all right the drink we are about to make is called lager amp lime
1eidpmniaje_1-5-rgb_front now this is going to be very difficult to remember so try to keep up
1eidpmniaje_2-5-rgb_front we are going to start off with our lager and go ahead and pour twelve ounces of beer into a glass
1eidpmniaje_3-5-rgb_front you probably want to do a frosted glass if you have it available and you are going to want to stick with the lager beer or at least a pretty light beer when you do this so we have got twelve ounces of lager and now we are going to add two ounces of lime juice
1eidpmniaje_4-5-rgb_front lager and lime what do you know
1eidpmniaje_5-5-rgb_front so let is go ahead and squeeze in two ounces and obviously you can do more or less depending on how much you like the taste of lime in your beer
1eidpmniaje_6_7-5-rgb_front there we go go ahead and pour that in and let is give it a little mix that should do it and you are not going to want to let this drink sit around for very long because the lime juice will actually separate after a little while and go ahead and give it a well let is set it up here
1eidpmniaje_8-5-rgb_front give it a lime and you have got a nice summer beer to enjoy
1eidpmniaje_9-5-rgb_front bottoms up
1ejirybswwu_1-5-rgb_front and we are going to go over another upper body stretch while you are on the ground
1ejirybswwu_10-5-rgb_front and that is another lat stretch
1ejirybswwu_2-5-rgb_front so we just did the cat stretch and now we are going to do a variation of that stretch getting more of the lats
1ejirybswwu_3-5-rgb_front and the lats are the wings on the side of your body
1ejirybswwu_4-5-rgb_front alright so getting on your you re on your knees both knees both hands you are like in the good solid sturdy position
1ejirybswwu_5-5-rgb_front now if i am going to stretch out my right lat i am going to drop i am going to bring my left shoulder closer to my left hip while trying to bring my right shoulder further away from my right hip therefore really increasing the distance between these two points
1ejirybswwu_6-5-rgb_front that and at the same time i am going to be twisting my hips to even greater the distance away from my hip to my shoulder
1ejirybswwu_7-5-rgb_front so by doing that i am really going to feel that stretch in the lower lat all the way up to the upper part of my lats or the wings on the side of my body
1ejirybswwu_8-5-rgb_front so the stretch will look like this
1ejirybswwu_9-5-rgb_front and you can do that on the on the other side as well too
1ekrrxycfb4_0-5-rgb_front let is look at what is involved in a
1ekrrxycfb4_1-5-rgb_front say you have done all the little things you can to your bike and it is time seek some professional help in the bike store
1ekrrxycfb4_2-5-rgb_front our here range anywhere from dollars to about eighty dollars depending on the services you need
1ekrrxycfb4_3-5-rgb_front basically what is involved is a complete check through of the bike
1ekrrxycfb4_4-5-rgb_front basically any will involve a wipe down of the bike a clean of all the surfaces checking critical bolts checking your wheels if they are straight checking your shifting if that is correct in the front and the rear as well as your braking
1ekrrxycfb4_5-5-rgb_front checking your bearing surfaces as well making sure there is no play in there no looseness everything is snug and correct
1ekrrxycfb4_6-5-rgb_front then test riding the bike
1ekrrxycfb4_7-5-rgb_front making sure that if it works on the stand that it works on the street with someone on the bike too
1ekrrxycfb4_8-5-rgb_front pretty much is the total run through of a bicycle to make sure it is correct from head to toe
1ekrrxycfb4_9-5-rgb_front so if you need professional help get a in any of our bike stores
1el9lb_ft68_0-5-rgb_front side flexion with your arms overhead
1el9lb_ft68_1-5-rgb_front it is another exercise that is great for your middle area for your obliques and your back extensors
1el9lb_ft68_10-5-rgb_front now notice how my head is going with the wrist of the spine
1el9lb_ft68_11-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that you do not just take the arms or let it all slump like this
1el9lb_ft68_12-5-rgb_front you want to make sure you keep your chest up and keep the head going with the rest of the spine
1el9lb_ft68_13-5-rgb_front you may want to look in the mirror and see your alignment make sure that you are in total in full alignment
1el9lb_ft68_14-5-rgb_front or pay attention to your body
1el9lb_ft68_15-5-rgb_front sometimes when you do this if you are not doing it correctly your back will let you know it will hurt or something will start bothering you
1el9lb_ft68_16_17-5-rgb_front that means that the body is letting you know that something is not right so again just keeping the arms overhead shoulders down inhale exhale
1el9lb_ft68_18-5-rgb_front do a feel
1el9lb_ft68_19-5-rgb_front do not forget to keep the tuck the minute you let the tuck this is what is going to happen not good for the back so keep it right here
1el9lb_ft68_2-5-rgb_front when you start in your standing position you want to make sure that you tuck your hips in so your back is straight
1el9lb_ft68_20-5-rgb_front do same number on each side and you are ready to go bikini time
1el9lb_ft68_21-5-rgb_front see you soon
1el9lb_ft68_3-5-rgb_front make sure that if you are not sure of what to do or if your back bothers you a little bit make sure somebody watches your form because sometimes people tend to do this and you see how my shoulders are behind my hips
1el9lb_ft68_4-5-rgb_front that is going to hurt your back
1el9lb_ft68_5-5-rgb_front it is not a push forward it is a tuck
1el9lb_ft68_6-5-rgb_front so that is something to remember
1el9lb_ft68_7-5-rgb_front now your feet are going to be underneath hips your knees are slightly bent you keep that tucked back in your tummy meaning take your belly button in your arms are going overhead
1el9lb_ft68_8-5-rgb_front be careful not to let the shoulders come up so you really have to keep them down pressing with the back muscles
1el9lb_ft68_9-5-rgb_front as you go down to the side flex you are going to take an inhale and when you come up you exhale
1eq8ths0zga_0-5-rgb_front in this clip i am going to be doing a half arc up and over with the inflatable ball
1eq8ths0zga_1-5-rgb_front now what we are going to do is extend one leg keeping the other one with the knee bent
1eq8ths0zga_10-5-rgb_front now this is the basic and your back is on an angle
1eq8ths0zga_11-5-rgb_front for more of a challenge you can lift that leg up slightly and let it down lift and lower lift and lower or you can maintain and lower
1eq8ths0zga_12-5-rgb_front now i would suggest doing sets of on each side
1eq8ths0zga_2-5-rgb_front now what we are going to do is we are going to take our ball and we are going to bring it across the body and back
1eq8ths0zga_3-5-rgb_front now i am leaning at a slight angle
1eq8ths0zga_4-5-rgb_front if you have back issues you can sit up a little bit straighter keep a nice long spine
1eq8ths0zga_5-5-rgb_front reach across and i take it back
1eq8ths0zga_6-5-rgb_front you are going to try to keep those shoulders nice and relaxed take it across and back
1eq8ths0zga_7-5-rgb_front now if that is a little bit too easy for you you can lift that leg slightly and just take it up and over and bring it back down in between up and over
1eq8ths0zga_8-5-rgb_front now for an increased challenge you can keep the leg elevated the whole time
1eq8ths0zga_9-5-rgb_front you are really going to feel a burn in the quad and you will also feel a little bit in the shoulder and the oblique
1ewp7htnyr4_0-5-rgb_front the next thing to think about when you structure your training program is weekly training
1ewp7htnyr4_1-5-rgb_front and what you do on a basis will vary on a number of factors
1ewp7htnyr4_10-5-rgb_front we will detail all of those as we continue
1ewp7htnyr4_5-5-rgb_front in swimming you should have some days where you emphasize technique you can have another day when you emphasize technique but adds a time travel and have another day that is higher intensity intervals
1ewp7htnyr4_8-5-rgb_front on the run you need to run at least three days a week and perhaps as many as five days a week
1ewp7htnyr4_9-5-rgb_front the running should also have a technique or in a day with some drills and some easy running and some strides there should be some endurance work and then progressing up the intensity ladder there is lactate threshold work and max work and tempo runs and speed work
1f1wadkaaci_0_1-5-rgb_front hi my name is windy st george and this is how to play twenty questions twenty questions is a simple parlor game that you can use to pass the time
1f1wadkaaci_10-5-rgb_front no
1f1wadkaaci_11-5-rgb_front is it a carnivore
1f1wadkaaci_12-5-rgb_front yes
1f1wadkaaci_13-5-rgb_front does it say meow
1f1wadkaaci_14-5-rgb_front no
1f1wadkaaci_15-5-rgb_front is it kept as a pet normally
1f1wadkaaci_16-5-rgb_front no
1f1wadkaaci_17-5-rgb_front okay is it ever kept as a pet
1f1wadkaaci_18-5-rgb_front no
1f1wadkaaci_19-5-rgb_front is it found in a circus
1f1wadkaaci_2-5-rgb_front you do not need any props
1f1wadkaaci_20-5-rgb_front no
1f1wadkaaci_21-5-rgb_front is it found in a zoo
1f1wadkaaci_22-5-rgb_front yes
1f1wadkaaci_23-5-rgb_front we are supposed to be counting questions
1f1wadkaaci_24-5-rgb_front you are supposed to count until twenty yeah
1f1wadkaaci_25-5-rgb_front when you play twenty questions there are typical questions that you ask help you narrow down quickly what the item is
1f1wadkaaci_26-5-rgb_front usually is it an animal a vegetable or a mineral or an idea and you have to get a yes or no for each one of those
1f1wadkaaci_27-5-rgb_front once you narrow that down you ask about its size
1f1wadkaaci_28-5-rgb_front usually is it bigger than a breadbox and so forth until you have got a rough idea of the size
1f1wadkaaci_29-5-rgb_front for animals you should ask what does it eat
1f1wadkaaci_3-5-rgb_front one person thinks of a of an object or an item that they are thinking of and the other person gets twenty questions to guess what it would be
1f1wadkaaci_30-5-rgb_front is it a vegetarian or a meat eater if it flies or if it swims and general questions like this if it has fur if it is warm blooded or cold blooded will help you narrow down until you can hopefully guess what the object is before your twenty questions are up
1f1wadkaaci_31-5-rgb_front and that is how you play twenty questions
1f1wadkaaci_4-5-rgb_front so why do not you think of something okay
1f1wadkaaci_5-5-rgb_front okay you usually start off by asking general questions help you narrow it down
1f1wadkaaci_6-5-rgb_front is it you can only ask yes or no questions very important
1f1wadkaaci_7-5-rgb_front is it an animal
1f1wadkaaci_8-5-rgb_front yes
1f1wadkaaci_9-5-rgb_front okay is it bigger than a breadbox
1f83rt08qms_0-5-rgb_front now we have got our slab prepared we want to cut it into the shape we are looking for
1f83rt08qms_1-5-rgb_front so i am going to have just a nice clean line just clean up that edge a little bit
1f83rt08qms_2-5-rgb_front and of course you can use a form if you need to help keep that line straight
1f83rt08qms_3-5-rgb_front i am going to cut the sides off a little bit and the back as well
1f83rt08qms_4-5-rgb_front and if you want to add a little decoration into the fan handle you can either roll the texture into it or just use your hands to make a nice little edge which is what i am going to do
1f83rt08qms_5-5-rgb_front give it a little bit extra a line down the middle and once that is glazed look real nice
1f83rt08qms_6-5-rgb_front and once you have got your handle with whatever decoration you want to have on it you are ready to attach it to your spinner
1f8o8y9vr2u_10-5-rgb_front now that we have got that opened up i can pull the sides and make the edge of the pie plate
1f8o8y9vr2u_6-5-rgb_front a little bit more thickness helps the piece be sturdy and survive that process
1f8o8y9vr2u_7-5-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and pull this almost to the edge of my twelve inch bat
1f8o8y9vr2u_8-5-rgb_front then i am going to take my hard rib and i am just going to compress the floor of this pie plate
1f8o8y9vr2u_9-5-rgb_front the compression makes it smooth and it also makes it strong
1famccdwszm_0-5-rgb_front hi
1famccdwszm_10-5-rgb_front it is hitting somewhere right in the middle
1famccdwszm_11-5-rgb_front it is not quite long enough and not quite short enough
1famccdwszm_12-5-rgb_front if i was somewhere around this length the length would at least be complimentary but again this charm just throws the entire outfit off
1famccdwszm_13-5-rgb_front so we would not want to choose this necklace with this particular outfit l
1famccdwszm_2-5-rgb_front now what to wear with this dress
1famccdwszm_3-5-rgb_front as you can see
1famccdwszm_4-5-rgb_front i have chosen a necklace here
1famccdwszm_5-5-rgb_front there is more than one thing wrong with this choice i have made the major part of this necklace has a print and my dress has a print
1famccdwszm_6-5-rgb_front these two prints do not work well together
1famccdwszm_7-5-rgb_front i mean i have busy print here filled with navy blues green s and just really beautiful color and then i have this charm it is kind of blah
1famccdwszm_8-5-rgb_front it does not mix well with what i am wearing
1famccdwszm_9-5-rgb_front second of all the length of this necklace is not the length that you would be really shooting for for a neckline like this
1fclph-obvw_1-5-rgb_front okay some of the accessories that come with a door of course are the handle
1fclph-obvw_2-5-rgb_front you are going to need a handle of course to be able to open to it that comes with a screw that will go through the door and then through the handle once we have the door installed
1fclph-obvw_3-5-rgb_front this piece is for the bottom it is threaded to be able to adjust the height of the door in case the door has little too much play and it does not reach the track right at the top
1fclph-obvw_4-5-rgb_front you can adjust it down raising the door and it will meet the track
1fclph-obvw_5-5-rgb_front these are all adjustable
1fclph-obvw_6-5-rgb_front these two go on the top and this is going to be the one that holds it in place
1fclph-obvw_7-5-rgb_front and of course your roller it is going to be the one that allows it to go back and forth in the track
1fclph-obvw_8-5-rgb_front this is kind of a guide and a roller at the same time
1fgzo3mod0s_1-5-rgb_front i am going to take you through a gymnastics class stretch and
1fgzo3mod0s_10-5-rgb_front i am going to keep my chest nice and forward because we do not want to hunch over and i am going to hold that again for at least seconds
1fgzo3mod0s_11-5-rgb_front when i am done i am going to pull this leg back and i am going to switch and repeat with the other leg
1fgzo3mod0s_12-5-rgb_front my hands are on my knee to keep my chest up
1fgzo3mod0s_13-5-rgb_front you can put your hands on your hips but i find when a lot of people do that they hunch forward
1fgzo3mod0s_14-5-rgb_front so put your hands on your knee do not lean forward and stretch
1fgzo3mod0s_2-5-rgb_front now i am going to stretch my hip flexors
1fgzo3mod0s_3-5-rgb_front again when you are jumping or tumbling you could easily pull any muscle especially in your legs
1fgzo3mod0s_4-5-rgb_front so you really want to stretch them out
1fgzo3mod0s_5-5-rgb_front now what i have done is gotten up on my knees from my other stretches and i have put one leg forward
1fgzo3mod0s_6-5-rgb_front when i stretch my hip flexor it is extremely important that i keep my knee just over my ankle
1fgzo3mod0s_7-5-rgb_front if i push too forward and get over my toes i am putting a lot of undue stress on my knee joints
1fgzo3mod0s_8-5-rgb_front so i want to keep my shin nice and straight
1fgzo3mod0s_9-5-rgb_front i am going to push forward ever so slightly until i feel that stretch right here in this leg and then here in my back leg
1fmphi-f3wy_1-5-rgb_front let is take a couple of minutes and talk to you about pruning trees
1fmphi-f3wy_10-5-rgb_front this is going to do a couple of things for us it is going to make sure one that i am not dropping the branch down into a garden or existing structures and two it is going to take some of the weight off the branch and make it safer and easier to take down
1fmphi-f3wy_11-5-rgb_front one of the tools that everybody that has a tree in their yard should have is a pole pruner
1fmphi-f3wy_12-5-rgb_front a pole pruner comes in a couple of different parts one there is a saw blade usually detachable we will talk more about that in a minute
1fmphi-f3wy_13-5-rgb_front the part that we are going to use now is a bypass pruner operates on a pulley system that can be operated on a long string pulled from the ground
1fmphi-f3wy_14-5-rgb_front we are going to use that right now to help take some weight off the branch
1fmphi-f3wy_15-5-rgb_front the next thing we are going to do is start sawing parts off this
1fmphi-f3wy_16-5-rgb_front now by bringing it down in sections i am making sure it is coming down in smaller more manageable chunks that are a lot less likely to damage to me or my garden
1fmphi-f3wy_2-5-rgb_front it is unfortunately but trees get old trees get sick
1fmphi-f3wy_3-5-rgb_front sometimes you just need a little bit more light in an area than you are currently getting and taking some branches off the bottom is a good way to handle that
1fmphi-f3wy_4-5-rgb_front now some jobs are going to be a little too big for you to handle but there are a lot of jobs that with the right tools you are going to be able to do the pruning on all yourself and in this case we have got one of those jobs
1fmphi-f3wy_5-5-rgb_front we have got a branch here down on the bottom and because of the way its been handled by other people over the course of the years its not in very good shape
1fmphi-f3wy_6-5-rgb_front you can see over here somebody went and put a swing on this branch and they did not do it the right way
1fmphi-f3wy_7-5-rgb_front they did not protect the branch they put chains on there and it is cut into the branch making the branch unhealthy and killing it
1fmphi-f3wy_8-5-rgb_front so we have got to take it down
1fmphi-f3wy_9-5-rgb_front what we are going to do is we are going to start by pruning the ends off the branch
1fstjdud1lq_11-5-rgb_front so i have it ironed and these two just meet i do not even have to worry about struggling to make it meet
1fstjdud1lq_12-5-rgb_front just do a little top sew
1fstjdud1lq_13-5-rgb_front and i am just right next to the edge
1fstjdud1lq_14-5-rgb_front and do not even worry about back tacking because i am going to show you how to attach it to the bag where all of this is hidden away
1fstjdud1lq_15-5-rgb_front i like to cut my threads though
1fstjdud1lq_16-5-rgb_front so i am going to flip it over and i am going to sew on this edge right here also
1fstjdud1lq_17-5-rgb_front and since i want to put four rows of stitching on it i am going to go ahead and look at it
1fstjdud1lq_18-5-rgb_front these guys are an inch apart so i am just going to go in about of an inch that should be about right on each side
1fstjdud1lq_19-5-rgb_front like i said if you wanted to you could just stay with doing these two or just one it does not matter
1fstjdud1lq_20-5-rgb_front but i am going to do my four
1fstjdud1lq_21-5-rgb_front and this one is a little easier i do not have to measure it out i just place it in between these two that i have
1fstjdud1lq_22-5-rgb_front take a little look
1fstjdud1lq_23-5-rgb_front yeah i guess was good it is all apart
1fstjdud1lq_24-5-rgb_front so now that i have my strap what i am going to do next is show you how to finish off the drawstring
1g4hf1cv-44_2-5-rgb_front what you want to do is you are just kind of rolling and pinching the skin very gently again very gently always very gently on the eye area
1g4hf1cv-44_3-5-rgb_front notice her skin is not stimulated at all it is not getting red at all and you just want to use the very tips of your fingers to move along the skin and then you want to just kind of follow the facial contour and as you practice doing these at home too you will start noticing different points that you will feel good and then you will just be hooked and you will want to do it all the time and another benefit of doing these specific movements at home is that the more practice you get the better at it you will become and then you will start noticing different points of your own face that feel good and then you will just be hooked
1gocwkavuh8_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to learn how to make gourmet coffee in your home
1gocwkavuh8_10-5-rgb_front i mentioned earlier that you do not want to use like a cheap whatever coffee beans to make your espresso shots
1gocwkavuh8_11-5-rgb_front what you do want to use though is a rich good coffee
1gocwkavuh8_12-5-rgb_front you can get a lot of just good coffees at your local grocery store and if you have an espresso grinder that is even better
1gocwkavuh8_13-5-rgb_front so what you are going to do is turn to a finer grind
1gocwkavuh8_14-5-rgb_front you are going to grind it and then you are going to be able to pull the shots
1gocwkavuh8_2-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to be talking a little about the coffee that we actually use the grind of it and what kind of roast we are going to use to get the best shots of espresso
1gocwkavuh8_3-5-rgb_front if you are using an espresso machine you are going to want to use like a finer grind of coffee
1gocwkavuh8_4-5-rgb_front to change the amount or the time that your espresso shots are going to take you are going to do a thicker or a finer grind
1gocwkavuh8_5-5-rgb_front finer grind is going to be less time on the shots
1gocwkavuh8_6-5-rgb_front a thicker grind is going to let the water sipped in a little bit more and take a longer time to pull the shots
1gocwkavuh8_7-5-rgb_front now we are using a fine grind right now which is great for us because we are pulling these great shots of espresso
1gocwkavuh8_8-5-rgb_front and with espresso the finer the grind the better the shots that we make
1gocwkavuh8_9-5-rgb_front also you want to be very aware of what kind of beans you are using
1gjvlelvne0_0-5-rgb_front we are talking about scheduling and working from a home office
1gjvlelvne0_1-5-rgb_front and how to use your time efficiently
1gjvlelvne0_2-5-rgb_front a lot of people have who work from home offices myself included
1gjvlelvne0_22-5-rgb_front now that is not always true
1gjvlelvne0_23-5-rgb_front and it depends on the work you are doing
1gjvlelvne0_24-5-rgb_front we all do different types of work from a home office
1gjvlelvne0_25-5-rgb_front some of us are running ebay business or writer like myself
1gjvlelvne0_26-5-rgb_front or maybe a computer programmer or a graphic artist
1gjvlelvne0_27-5-rgb_front whatever you do
1gjvlelvne0_28-5-rgb_front you know but for the most part we can kind of
1gjvlelvne0_29-5-rgb_front we kind of know how long our job is are going to take
1gjvlelvne0_3-5-rgb_front have found that it is very helpful if you set up a routine or a schedule
1gjvlelvne0_30-5-rgb_front so it is nice to kind of pace out and schedule
1gjvlelvne0_31-5-rgb_front especially if it is a job that is due down the road
1gjvlelvne0_32-5-rgb_front so we will talk about how to kind of take your projects
1gjvlelvne0_33-5-rgb_front and how to space them out to make sure they get done by deadlines
1gjvlelvne0_34-5-rgb_front we will talk about deadlines next
1gjvlelvne0_4-5-rgb_front while you are working at home
1gjvlelvne0_5-5-rgb_front and that kind of keeps you from just getting too scattered
1gjvlelvne0_6-5-rgb_front and either working too much or too little
1gjvlelvne0_7-5-rgb_front to just kind of you know space your time out
1gjvlelvne0_8-5-rgb_front for me what works well is i have i use my google calendar
1glhmfja0lq_1-8-rgb_front now we have the finished product the triangle top that we started off with and then the bottom
1glhmfja0lq_10-8-rgb_front it gives it a better fit but this is optional but it does look well on her body in this suit
1glhmfja0lq_11-8-rgb_front also another thing to keep in mind the padding in the top and the lining is completely optional as well but it does give your suit more of a fitting and a especially if you have the lining in it it does give your suit longer wear to it and if you accidentally do machine wash it will be probably fine
1glhmfja0lq_12-8-rgb_front so there is a couple of things in this suit that you can change
1glhmfja0lq_13-8-rgb_front there is a couple of things you can make
1glhmfja0lq_14-8-rgb_front the band may be wider also on the top you can trim it in different colors maybe the pink would look really great in this suit as well
1glhmfja0lq_15-8-rgb_front so once you get your pattern you can always tweak it after your final product as well
1glhmfja0lq_16-8-rgb_front all you have to do is you are just going to take out something you do not like and put something into the suit so it is up to you
1glhmfja0lq_17-8-rgb_front in conclusion you have seen us start from scratch from building a pattern and making a pattern into the finished product
1glhmfja0lq_18-8-rgb_front what might be a good idea is you to go out to the store and buy some fabric maybe is not very expensive
1glhmfja0lq_19-8-rgb_front just buy the cheapest you can do to practice
1glhmfja0lq_2-8-rgb_front what is neat about the bottom is that it does have this band here that goes all the way around
1glhmfja0lq_20-8-rgb_front that is the key here
1glhmfja0lq_21-8-rgb_front to make a good suit you are going to need to practice
1glhmfja0lq_22-8-rgb_front so if you do buy just the cheaper material practice into it and then once you figure out okay well i need to alter it this way you can go back to your pattern and alter it
1glhmfja0lq_23-8-rgb_front so there are steps like that that you can do to make a good suit
1glhmfja0lq_24-8-rgb_front you have seen it and then you can do it
1glhmfja0lq_25-8-rgb_front it is very simple
1glhmfja0lq_26-8-rgb_front it is very fun doing it and all you have to do is just the follow the steps to it
1glhmfja0lq_27-8-rgb_front and then once you have figured out your perfect pattern and everything you can go out to the store buy the fabric that you want and make it into something wonderful
1glhmfja0lq_3-8-rgb_front the band is just a little bit something that is different and it also helps your suit stay on as well
1glhmfja0lq_4-8-rgb_front here we did no jewelry on the piece but you could put on maybe a ring or something dangling from either side that you like and also from the top if you wanted something extra as well
1glhmfja0lq_5-8-rgb_front so this is the finished product that we have
1glhmfja0lq_6-8-rgb_front you saw us make it
1glhmfja0lq_7-8-rgb_front you saw us with making the design of the suit making the pattern picking out your fabric and then starting to sew it
1glhmfja0lq_8-8-rgb_front and with this suit we did decide to do the elastic
1glhmfja0lq_9-8-rgb_front elastic just kind of brings the suit a little bit more closer to the body
1gwusiofchi_0-5-rgb_front amanda claire all right so to tin the wire remember we are going to put the iron onto the wire get the wire really really hot and remember you want to kind of stay away from touching your soldering iron to the solder itself
1gwusiofchi_1-5-rgb_front i mean obviously you can it is fine but the point of soldering is not to melt the solder with the iron it is more to heat up the metal electrical component with the iron and let the heat from the component melt the solder so it is kind of an indirect heating
1gwusiofchi_2-5-rgb_front so here i am kind of heating the wire i am going to get it close to the solder and the solder should kind of flow over our wire here if we are there it started to go
1gwusiofchi_3-5-rgb_front there we go there we go and there we go
1gwusiofchi_4-5-rgb_front now we have pretty much tinned our wire we will do a little bit more there yeah okay
1gwusiofchi_5-5-rgb_front so you have a nicely tinned wire basically it just means that is it is coated with solder
1gwusiofchi_6-5-rgb_front and since we are here let is just might as well let is just do the other one
1gwusiofchi_7-5-rgb_front same deal we will kind of get the wire hot kind of get it near the solder and whoop there we go
1gwusiofchi_8-5-rgb_front it happens real quickly
1gwusiofchi_9-5-rgb_front you will find that this stranded copper heats up very very fast which is good
1gyeohdf49k_0-5-rgb_front hi
1gyeohdf49k_1-5-rgb_front i am billy from bill is pet shop
1gyeohdf49k_10-5-rgb_front very very sociable they will like all members of the family
1gyeohdf49k_11-5-rgb_front you want to try hold your hand out press it up up
1gyeohdf49k_12-5-rgb_front that is kind of easy yeah all you have to do is put it that is right put it right in front of him
1gyeohdf49k_13-5-rgb_front parakeets are easy to care for and make wonderful pets because of their great disposition for children
1gyeohdf49k_14-5-rgb_front you can teach them to sit on your hand very easily even a child can do it
1gyeohdf49k_2-5-rgb_front today we are going to talk about the best bird for a child
1gyeohdf49k_3-5-rgb_front my favorites are parakeet
1gyeohdf49k_9-5-rgb_front they will learn to step right up with very little care very little training time
1h-0xmsyuna_10-5-rgb_front get your oven to put it in a nice preset oven for about minutes no more then that and when you take it out we are going to put in the boiler for about minutes
1h-0xmsyuna_11-5-rgb_front we are going to add some more cheese to give it that brown effect i am going to show you the finish product
1h55083vywi_10-8-rgb_front what i want to do is just slowly lower the vehicle on to that jack so the jacks the jack stand so the jack stand is carrying the load
1h55083vywi_11-8-rgb_front so it will be able to slowly settle down and let it come to a stop and i like to leave the jack in there as another safety feature
1h55083vywi_12-8-rgb_front it is not carrying the load right now it is just is just below where the frame is
1h55083vywi_13-8-rgb_front i let the jack stand carry the load but the jack is left in place in case of a failure
1h55083vywi_14-8-rgb_front please watch our next segment on removing the front tire
1h55083vywi_2-8-rgb_front so we want to jack the vehicle up
1h55083vywi_3-8-rgb_front we do not want to jack it up to such an angle that it is going to create a hazard or danger by tilting or applying too much force on the other side
1h55083vywi_4-8-rgb_front so i have got it up with the tire probably around a foot off the ground and that is more than adequate to give us plenty of room to work and keep a good safety margin
1h55083vywi_5-8-rgb_front so this time once i have got it jacked up i am going to put it on a jack stand or another device to safely carry the load
1h55083vywi_6-8-rgb_front i place that jack stand underneath the frame right at the very front where the unibody frame comes up and the front suspension meet
1h55083vywi_7-8-rgb_front it is a good place to stabilize and carry the load
1h55083vywi_8-8-rgb_front now turning very slowly it you break this free it is going to want to turn fast
1h55083vywi_9-8-rgb_front so you gotta kinda be careful and regulate it
1hvi7u22egg_0-5-rgb_front richard buccola hi this is rich buccola of new york city
1hvi7u22egg_10-5-rgb_front and what happens now we are going to boil some water for our noodles
1hvi7u22egg_11-5-rgb_front it is almost time for dinner
1hvi7u22egg_12-5-rgb_front we have just tasted a little bit of it and it is amazing but we want it to thicken up a little bit so i have it on a very low flame
1hvi7u22egg_13-5-rgb_front and while my water starts to boil in my saucepan for our noodles i am just going to occasionally stir it
1hvi7u22egg_14-5-rgb_front and when i actually take this off the heat it will really thicken up and be a really nice sauce
1hvi7u22egg_15-5-rgb_front it tastes amazing
1hvi7u22egg_16-5-rgb_front it tastes a little bit of the wine
1hvi7u22egg_17-5-rgb_front it is really good
1hvi7u22egg_18-5-rgb_front i hope you guys make this
1hvi7u22egg_2-5-rgb_front all right we are almost done
1hvi7u22egg_3-5-rgb_front i am making sure this is just nice and smooth that it did not get any lumps from your flour
1hvi7u22egg_4-5-rgb_front just make sure you do that
1hvi7u22egg_5-5-rgb_front just going to keep spreading that all around nice
1hvi7u22egg_6-5-rgb_front what we are going to do now is just add this right to our mixture of beef and onions and mushrooms like so
1hvi7u22egg_7-5-rgb_front yes this is so good
1hvi7u22egg_8-5-rgb_front let is just give that a good mix
1hvi7u22egg_9-5-rgb_front i am going to put that under a low flame and let it thicken up
1i3vibe5aee_5-5-rgb_front this is a little bit more of an advanced movement and it is a very subtle movement
1i3vibe5aee_6-5-rgb_front so let is first start by sliding out to the side lifting the chest pulling in as you come back to the center sliding out to the opposite direction lifting coming back to your center
1i3vibe5aee_7-5-rgb_front pulling in pulling out to the side and lift into the center and we just continue it into your figure
1i3vibe5aee_8-5-rgb_front let is try it with some music
1i3vibe5aee_9-5-rgb_front five six seven eight
1i6c2inpr0a_10-5-rgb_front that is okay
1i6c2inpr0a_11-5-rgb_front it does not really matter if it is green or white
1i6c2inpr0a_12-5-rgb_front actually indeed with the stocking colors you are going to see it is going to flow very nicely from the green to one of the few areas of our costume that will not be green
1i6c2inpr0a_13-5-rgb_front now you want to keep going up your leg right about to the level
1i6c2inpr0a_14-5-rgb_front that is as far up you want to go
1i6c2inpr0a_2-5-rgb_front this is similar
1i6c2inpr0a_3-5-rgb_front basically you are going to take the fabric and keep rolling around basically up your ankle your calf and your leg
1i6c2inpr0a_4-5-rgb_front do this very slowly
1i6c2inpr0a_5-5-rgb_front make sure that you are basically the folds are very strong and over
1i6c2inpr0a_6-5-rgb_front otherwise it will come undone
1i6c2inpr0a_7-5-rgb_front you do not want that
1i6c2inpr0a_8-5-rgb_front so definitely keep going up the leg all the way to the top here
1i6c2inpr0a_9-5-rgb_front now you will notice actually that the underline fabric in this case is white
1i70ko7kn8e_1-5-rgb_front the first thing we want to do is paint our clothespins and you can paint them any color you would like
1i70ko7kn8e_2-5-rgb_front i am going to paint them blue you wait and you do this all the way across the top and on the sides and then you will want to set them aside for just a few minutes
1i70ko7kn8e_3-5-rgb_front now that they have let our clothespin dry i am ready to add a decoration to this
1i70ko7kn8e_4-5-rgb_front i am going to add a dragonfly this is a little prepainted wood piece i picked up at the craft store
1i70ko7kn8e_5-5-rgb_front we are going to add this piece to the handle end of our clothespin so i am going to add a dot of glue and then i am going to press down like that and then we will want to let that dry a minute
1i70ko7kn8e_6-5-rgb_front i want to make a set of these so i have also painted two different two more clothespins and picked up some more insects or bug type wood pieces to add to them
1i70ko7kn8e_7-5-rgb_front now i have my set of buggy chip clips
1i70ko7kn8e_8-5-rgb_front once they have dried we can use them to hold chip bags or any other kind of bags closed
1i7yrwosij8_0-5-rgb_front my name is zeibra lemley with the different vibe true beauty and barber salon and in this segment i am going to show you how to do pigtails or otherwise known as willie nelson braids
1i7yrwosij8_1-5-rgb_front in the case of making a good pigtail just to make sure that the hair is parted straight down the center
1i7yrwosij8_10-5-rgb_front i am going to take the hair in the middle and i am going to bring it over to the second with the first section was and i am going to take the hair in the left hand and i am going to cross it under
1i7yrwosij8_11-5-rgb_front i am going to keep doing this until i get all the way down to the end of the braid
1i7yrwosij8_2-5-rgb_front so the hair can be evenly distribute on both sides
1i7yrwosij8_3-5-rgb_front you do not want a pigtail that one is better than the other
1i7yrwosij8_4-5-rgb_front so we are going to slice that here straight down the middle making sure each side is evenly distribute
1i7yrwosij8_5-5-rgb_front when you comb it through you are going to gather all the hair in your hand
1i7yrwosij8_6-5-rgb_front you are going to comb straight through till you make a like a pigtail
1i7yrwosij8_7-5-rgb_front and to keep it this braid is to make sure that the hair you start to braid at the nape of the neck
1i7yrwosij8_8-5-rgb_front now i am going to take the hair and i am going to slice it off to three sections a section for my right hand a section for my left hand and there is a section in the middle
1i7yrwosij8_9-5-rgb_front start to braid i am going to take the hair thats in my right hand and i am going to cross it under to my hair in my left hand
1ihia_6xxri_12-5-rgb_front they are kind of like big poofy baggy pants for comfortable sleeping
1ihia_6xxri_13-5-rgb_front come up just like that
1ihia_6xxri_14-5-rgb_front and i guess this could also be like a hip hop outfit if you really wanted it to be but it is not my intention
1ihia_6xxri_15-5-rgb_front i am going for pajamas comfy pajamas
1ihia_6xxri_16-5-rgb_front and then her little bare feet kind of sticking out the ends there
1ihia_6xxri_17-5-rgb_front and you can draw like obviously some pattern on them
1ihia_6xxri_18-5-rgb_front most pajamas seem to have a pattern of some kind
1ihia_6xxri_19-5-rgb_front little hearts maybe
1ihia_6xxri_20-5-rgb_front you know
1ihia_6xxri_21-5-rgb_front something kind of girlie for bedtime
1ihia_6xxri_22-5-rgb_front yeah
1ihia_6xxri_23-5-rgb_front that looks like a nice little pajama combo right there
1ihia_6xxri_24-5-rgb_front tank top baggy pants
1ihia_6xxri_25-5-rgb_front there you go
1ihia_6xxri_26-5-rgb_front pajamas
1ikgxa-7jfi_10-5-rgb_front okay now that we have the binding all pinned on we are going to go ahead and attach it
1ikgxa-7jfi_11-5-rgb_front we are just going to start at the edge there and sew right along the edge removing the pins as we come to them
1ikgxa-7jfi_19-5-rgb_front okay once we have the first edge completed we are going to pin the binding on the second edge the exact same way only we are going to wrap it around the edge and pin it so that it goes around the edge on both ends and then we are ready to sew the second side on
1ikgxa-7jfi_3-5-rgb_front we are not going to take any of the pins out yet
1ikgxa-7jfi_4-5-rgb_front we are not going to take anything out
1ikgxa-7jfi_5-5-rgb_front we are going to add this on so pinning it right perpendicular to how we are going to sew it right along the edge
1ikgxa-7jfi_6-5-rgb_front at the corner we are going to turn and we are going to give it just a little fold there so it has room to go around the corner
1ikgxa-7jfi_7-5-rgb_front and in this first step we are going to go ahead and pin all the way up to this point
1ikgxa-7jfi_8-5-rgb_front so we are going to trim it just past this point and that is as much as we need for the first step
1ikgxa-7jfi_9-5-rgb_front we are going to go ahead and finish pinning that in place
1iklslfttls_10-5-rgb_front so you are got to keep this up really high to really isolate the triceps
1iklslfttls_11-5-rgb_front so back and in
1iklslfttls_12-5-rgb_front now your breathing is exhale as you extend out inhale to bring that hand back
1iklslfttls_13-5-rgb_front now if you want a little bit more burn right here keep your arm out and just little tiny pulses right here
1iklslfttls_14-5-rgb_front and then you go back to singles
1iklslfttls_15-5-rgb_front now do not forget to change arms you want to be balanced
1iklslfttls_16-5-rgb_front so that is your tricep back extension
1iklslfttls_8-5-rgb_front the other arm is lifted so you have got a nice bent elbow here
1iklslfttls_9-5-rgb_front keep your elbow up in line with your shoulder and then simply just extend your arm and bring that fist right to the shoulder
1irhehx1lbs_10-5-rgb_front it is very easy to start doing this
1irhehx1lbs_11-5-rgb_front this is not the move this could be a variation of the move but it is not the move
1irhehx1lbs_12-5-rgb_front we are just twisting the lower body slightly to present our audience with our working hip step
1irhehx1lbs_13-5-rgb_front hip
1irhehx1lbs_14-5-rgb_front step
1irhehx1lbs_15-5-rgb_front hip
1irhehx1lbs_16-5-rgb_front let is try it together
1irhehx1lbs_17-5-rgb_front step
1irhehx1lbs_18-5-rgb_front hip
1irhehx1lbs_19-5-rgb_front so shoulders stay square walking forward and step
1irhehx1lbs_20-5-rgb_front hip
1irhehx1lbs_21-5-rgb_front feet come together knees line up same direction
1irhehx1lbs_22-5-rgb_front step
1irhehx1lbs_23-5-rgb_front you do not want your knees going out here right
1irhehx1lbs_24-5-rgb_front step
1irhehx1lbs_25-5-rgb_front knees together lift
1irhehx1lbs_26-5-rgb_front step
1irhehx1lbs_27-5-rgb_front lift
1irhehx1lbs_28-5-rgb_front forward step
1irhehx1lbs_29-5-rgb_front lift
1irhehx1lbs_30-5-rgb_front step
1irhehx1lbs_31-5-rgb_front lift
1irhehx1lbs_32-5-rgb_front step
1irhehx1lbs_33-5-rgb_front lift
1irhehx1lbs_34-5-rgb_front slight angle very good
1irhehx1lbs_35-5-rgb_front try it in the mirror it looks more complicated
1irhehx1lbs_36-5-rgb_front it looks very easy but it is actually it takes a lot of concentration to keep those shoulders forward
1irhehx1lbs_5-5-rgb_front if we bring the left foot here to meet it and bend the knees and then bring the chest back forward you get a nice line in the body
1irhehx1lbs_9-5-rgb_front now it is very important to try this in front of a mirror so you can make sure your shoulders stay forward
1irjxmx85rg_0-5-rgb_front allyn christopher okay our turbine is properly installed there as well as these bearings
1irjxmx85rg_1-5-rgb_front look at that
1irjxmx85rg_10-5-rgb_front and again low torque low speed
1irjxmx85rg_11-5-rgb_front it should make that clicking sound
1irjxmx85rg_12-5-rgb_front but you are not going to hear the clicking sound cause i am not tightening them all the way cause this has can see over here it is keyed so that it can slide in and out and once we get the next piece on we are going to set it at the perfect perfect setting for it look at that
1irjxmx85rg_13-5-rgb_front all right here is our old one
1irjxmx85rg_14-5-rgb_front this is the turbine shield the turbine itself and still has the old tube attached and so again i am going to turn it out
1irjxmx85rg_15-5-rgb_front again one of the pieces that does not come in the kit very rarely does anything happen to this
1irjxmx85rg_16-5-rgb_front so you are more likely to break it during a repair than you are to actually do it break itself during operation
1irjxmx85rg_17-5-rgb_front old tube you see it is a little warped stiff does not want to retain it is not good
1irjxmx85rg_18-5-rgb_front good thing the kit comes with a brand new flexible very supple
1irjxmx85rg_2-5-rgb_front it is practically a perpetual motion machine
1irjxmx85rg_6-5-rgb_front i will say it three times
1irjxmx85rg_7-5-rgb_front turbine shaft shield
1irjxmx85rg_8-5-rgb_front shaft shield
1irjxmx85rg_9-5-rgb_front there are just a couple of places where it goes here and we are going to put this on right here as a place holder and then we are going to now the screws from this are going to be the originals too
1irrpqjqvi4_0-5-rgb_front hi i am stan defreitas mr green thumb for on gardening
1irrpqjqvi4_1-5-rgb_front one of the most important elements of all plants is nitrogen
1irrpqjqvi4_10-5-rgb_front this may leak out quicker than some other sources of nitrogen but it is still a pretty readily source and it will be used in water and of course remember that is where plants have to absorb the nutrients
1irrpqjqvi4_11-5-rgb_front so nitrogen the first number is an element that is going to give you green and grow
1irrpqjqvi4_12-5-rgb_front if you ever look at some of the lawn foods they are normally higher in that first number
1irrpqjqvi4_2-5-rgb_front nitrogen is always always the first number on the bag or on the bottle
1irrpqjqvi4_3-5-rgb_front it will usually be npnk
1irrpqjqvi4_4-5-rgb_front the first number is nitrogen
1irrpqjqvi4_5-5-rgb_front why is it important
1irrpqjqvi4_6-5-rgb_front well nitrogen helps your plant to grow
1irrpqjqvi4_7-5-rgb_front it is the green and growing element
1irrpqjqvi4_8-5-rgb_front if you want your little plant to get up and grow you want to make sure it has a good source of nitrogen
1irrpqjqvi4_9-5-rgb_front this particular bottle has nitrogen and you see it happens to be ammoniacal nitrogen which is okay
1isbp6ar-7i_0-5-rgb_front the history of motocross is a very rich one it started in europe as scrambles in the is culminating with the formation of the motocross of nations which is basically the olympics for motorcycles in
1isbp6ar-7i_1-5-rgb_front the world sanctioning body for motorcycling the fim or the federation for international motorcycling in started the world motocross grand prix series which was the pinnacle at that time
1isbp6ar-7i_2-5-rgb_front in several of the european riders sent over to america to do some races called the trans ama series which was kind of a a national series over here
1isbp6ar-7i_3-5-rgb_front that sparked motorcycling here to the point where in the ama or the american motorcyclist association started the series that is now the ama motocross nationals
1isbp6ar-7i_4-5-rgb_front after motorcycling in america in general just gained huge popularity all through the eighties with riders like johnny rick johnson broc glover and david bailey really set a precedent and popularized almost to to mainstream stardom some of the top riders in in motocross
1isbp6ar-7i_5-5-rgb_front and nowadays we have the american supercross series which is the basically the pinnacle of racing in the world as well as the ama motocross national series that spurred from the original series that they promoted and today the united states is is a hotbed for motocross attracting the top riders from all over the world
1iyeeilmaa8_1-5-rgb_front now a bevel is actually a piece of clear glass that has been smoothed and polished down on it is sides
1iyeeilmaa8_10-5-rgb_front they work really well to go around the border of some of your leaded and foiled projects as well to add an extra dimension and elegance to them

1igrvp7atxe_2-5-rgb_front if you have neighbors that are looking for canes you can rip them up and spring transplant them
1igrvp7atxe_3-5-rgb_front you do not even need a lot of ceremony you can just rip them up and replant them
1igrvp7atxe_4-5-rgb_front these are very special they are not red they are not purple they are golden
1igrvp7atxe_5-5-rgb_front we find them especially pest free and easy to produce
1igrvp7atxe_6-5-rgb_front now the goal in pruning this patch is to leave a small percentage maybe or of these canes intact which means that i have hundreds of canes that need cutting
1igrvp7atxe_7-5-rgb_front so what i am going to do is in my mind i am going to choose some of these mature beautiful canes that have growth ready for they are second year in fruiting and everything else anything that does not meet the grade in the path in the way not big enough old and dead
1igrvp7atxe_8-5-rgb_front you see i am finding excuses to cut everything but the champs this being a champ here

1iv4awwkhxg_2-5-rgb_front it really just takes some practice
1iv4awwkhxg_3-5-rgb_front now how you want to do it what you feel more comfortable with it is going to be you will figure that out as you get into your processing you try these different things of which works better for you
1iv4awwkhxg_4-5-rgb_front when registering your print you can also make the choices to to give you some other interesting possibilities with how it is going to print if you just slightly
1iv4awwkhxg_5-5-rgb_front registering your print does become significantly more important when you are doing multicolored prints or you are doing you want lines to match up perfectly
1iv4awwkhxg_6-5-rgb_front as you can see here i simply just printed over top of it three times and it is almost the the traits of what was behind it is almost gone
1iv4awwkhxg_7-5-rgb_front this was just to give you an idea of registering your block of wood
1iv4awwkhxg_8-5-rgb_front but it will take some time it will take some time to get used to and that should not discourage you as in most things in woodcut printmaking it will take some time to get the hang of it

1j3uad2lu-g_1-5-rgb_front first make sure that it is nice and on center might have to reposition it a little bit

1jfva3hlnjs_1-5-rgb_front in the environment that you provide for your chameleon there are several things that you need to make sure are not dangerous
1jfva3hlnjs_10-5-rgb_front your lizard is not usually going to turn upside down and absorb the heat through their belly
1jfva3hlnjs_11-5-rgb_front so from the top is the best bet
1jfva3hlnjs_12-5-rgb_front you want to provide lots of antibacterial ointment for your lizard is burn
1jfva3hlnjs_13-5-rgb_front you want to make sure it stays on there you need to wipe it off and change it at least on a daily basis and make sure that you remove anything from the cage that could stick to the antibacterial ointment
1jfva3hlnjs_14-5-rgb_front now another danger in the environment for chameleons is ingestion of foreign objects
1jfva3hlnjs_15-5-rgb_front because they are creatures their tongue will also catch surrounding items such as the substrate
1jfva3hlnjs_16-5-rgb_front i feed this one out of a dish but if were to throw a cricket in there that was running around she would grab it and most likely if it was on the ground she will collect some of the substrate and then she will ingest it
1jfva3hlnjs_17-5-rgb_front now this can also cause intestinal blockage which could require a surgery
1jfva3hlnjs_18-5-rgb_front it is much easier avoided than it seems
1jfva3hlnjs_19-5-rgb_front make sure that everything you have in your vivarium is large enough to not be swallowed and if it is small enough to be swallowed it is biodegradable and digestible for your chameleon
1jfva3hlnjs_2-5-rgb_front some dangers in her environment could include exposed lighting or heat sources
1jfva3hlnjs_3-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that there is no access

1k3gspm6akq_11-5-rgb_front it is usually just going to go left and right or you can add a back and a forward and if you want to get really intricate you can just add a turn come here two three and turn two three here
1k3gspm6akq_12-5-rgb_front standard grapevine that is in pretty much every warm up

1k3gspm6akq_5-5-rgb_front we are going to take our right foot step it behind then you are going to take your left foot and step it out
1k3gspm6akq_6-5-rgb_front see you just go the other way
1k3gspm6akq_7-5-rgb_front you take your right foot and step it down and step your left foot behind and take your right foot and you step it out
1k3gspm6akq_8-5-rgb_front that is the basic bottom half move for your grapevine
1k3gspm6akq_9-5-rgb_front the top part is really optional
1kklzklwdtm_0-5-rgb_front okay so we have completed this look the bronze goddess and she looks pretty bronze
1kklzklwdtm_1-5-rgb_front i mean you can tell from her hand to her face that we really we have really bronzed her up
1kklzklwdtm_10-5-rgb_front just bring like a little press powder with you with either a sponge or a travel brush just so you can powder your nose and your forehead and your chin just in case they get a little tiny bit oily
1kklzklwdtm_11-5-rgb_front because even though this is a doey look you do not want to look oily or sweaty
1kklzklwdtm_12-5-rgb_front the eyes most like will stay
1kklzklwdtm_13-5-rgb_front the only thing is since we did eyeliner inside the eye you might want to have to you might have to reapply that every so often
1kklzklwdtm_14-5-rgb_front so bring your eyeliner with you and that is really easy you can just throw that in your purse
1kklzklwdtm_15-5-rgb_front and lastly your lip gloss that the most important
1kklzklwdtm_16-5-rgb_front you want to make sure you bring your lip glosses with you which ever lip glosses that you mixed if it is one if it is two and a little lip brush or you can use your fingertips if you want
1kklzklwdtm_17-5-rgb_front just make sure your hands are clean
1kklzklwdtm_18-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that you reapply your lip gloss every so often cause that is going to come off pretty much
1kklzklwdtm_19-5-rgb_front now your blush and your bronzer it just depends on the person sometimes it stays
1kklzklwdtm_20-5-rgb_front my blush and bronzer does not stay very well on me so sometimes i like to bring it with me and bring a little travel brush
1kklzklwdtm_21-5-rgb_front you can get little short travel brushes with cases and throw it in your purse just to touch up your blush or your bronzer every so often
1kklzklwdtm_22-5-rgb_front and that is about it this look is pretty long lasting and it goes it transitions well from day to evening also
1kklzklwdtm_23-5-rgb_front so that is about it we are pretty much done with this
1kklzklwdtm_2_3_4_5-5-rgb_front so do you like your look yes yeah it looks good on you your eyes look really blue this is a good look for anybody really
1kklzklwdtm_6-5-rgb_front if you are brown eyes blue eyes green eyes it does not matter it is a good look for any skin tone it really does not matter
1kklzklwdtm_7-5-rgb_front it is a pretty transitional look for anyone any hair color even

1ktyhaoxjbe_11-5-rgb_front okay we are going to take the pin bones out of this filet as well
1ktyhaoxjbe_12-5-rgb_front once again you are feeling with your fingertips along to find the row
1ktyhaoxjbe_13-5-rgb_front you do not want to go any further than the last bone
1ktyhaoxjbe_14-5-rgb_front and you want to cut right along the edge of the bones the best you can without losing any yield wasting any flesh
1ktyhaoxjbe_15-5-rgb_front and i am going to trim this side out as well
1ktyhaoxjbe_16-5-rgb_front and there is your pin bone right there
1ktyhaoxjbe_17-5-rgb_front and that is edible if you want to pick through the bones or if not you have got a boneless filet
1ktyhaoxjbe_4-5-rgb_front and you are going to take your boning knife once again the same knife that you used to filet the fish
1ktyhaoxjbe_5-5-rgb_front you need to kind of feel this is the really messy dirty job
1ktyhaoxjbe_6-5-rgb_front you got to get into it
1ktyhaoxjbe_7-5-rgb_front you want to feel the pin bone and you want to go along the top as much as close as you can to the bone without losing any flesh

1kwcagqpvew_1-5-rgb_front so now that i have the placket taken apart
1kwcagqpvew_19-5-rgb_front so what we are going to do is take ours and just refold it right there at right there
1kwcagqpvew_2-5-rgb_front all the seams are undone
1kwcagqpvew_20-5-rgb_front and the idea is to make my three quarters of an inch chalk line to the original crease that is folded over on the placket
1kwcagqpvew_21-5-rgb_front this is ninety degrees and these two pieces on the side are degrees to make
1kwcagqpvew_22-5-rgb_front so you can tell this is a hundred and eighty degree angle right here
1kwcagqpvew_23-5-rgb_front and to keep this i want to go ahead and just pin it
1kwcagqpvew_24-5-rgb_front pin this right here and then i am going to pin this one
1kwcagqpvew_25-5-rgb_front and in the next clip i am going to show you how to fold it over and we are going to have it pinned and folded before we even get an iron to it
1kwcagqpvew_26-5-rgb_front so we will do that in the next clip
1kwcagqpvew_3-5-rgb_front this ninety degree angle that is already there has been taken apart
1kwcagqpvew_4-5-rgb_front and this is what i want to show you how to work on next is this top placket piece
1kwcagqpvew_5-5-rgb_front and we look underneath you can tell it is two angles put together to make a ninety degree
1kwcagqpvew_6-5-rgb_front most of the time it is and
1kwcagqpvew_7-5-rgb_front and this one is a little bit off just because it is not as well made

1lgvgkloycq_13-5-rgb_front you never use this
1lgvgkloycq_14-5-rgb_front you never use this
1lgvgkloycq_15-5-rgb_front it is always as a matter of fact
1lgvgkloycq_16-5-rgb_front so you are nodding your head sometimes

1lgvgkloycq_18-5-rgb_front your body is open
1lgvgkloycq_19-5-rgb_front it is relaxed
1lgvgkloycq_2-5-rgb_front and as in the word relaxed you are going to show that you are relaxed

1lgvgkloycq_3-5-rgb_front you are not going to be slouching as in boredom or sleepiness
1lgvgkloycq_4-5-rgb_front you are going to be sitting up straight but you are relaxed
1lgvgkloycq_5-5-rgb_front usually your legs are not crossed
1lgvgkloycq_6-5-rgb_front you can have maybe your ankles cross behind you

1ljh--6h_rk_0-5-rgb_front this segment is on hitting to your full potential long drives
1ljh--6h_rk_1-5-rgb_front and the longer the shaft the wider the arc
1ljh--6h_rk_10-5-rgb_front as a rule of thumb each inch will give you five yards
1ljh--6h_rk_11-5-rgb_front so if you have a inch driver and go to there is a chance you are going to gain fifteen yards
1ljh--6h_rk_12-5-rgb_front will you lose some accuracy
1ljh--6h_rk_13-5-rgb_front probably
1ljh--6h_rk_14-5-rgb_front but if you want to experiment take an old driver bring it into a pro shop or an off course store
1ljh--6h_rk_15-5-rgb_front have them put a plug in three inches
1ljh--6h_rk_16-5-rgb_front put on a grip
1ljh--6h_rk_17-5-rgb_front practice with a longer driver
1ljh--6h_rk_18-5-rgb_front you will hit longer and you might be surprised that you actually do not lose that much accuracy
1ljh--6h_rk_2-5-rgb_front the wider the arc the more club head speed
1ljh--6h_rk_3-5-rgb_front the more club head speed the further the ball is going to go
1ljh--6h_rk_4-5-rgb_front for many years a driver could be any length
1ljh--6h_rk_5-5-rgb_front but now the usga has set a limit at inches
1ljh--6h_rk_6-5-rgb_front most drivers today that you would buy would be to inches
1ljh--6h_rk_7-5-rgb_front will a inch driver give you less accuracy
1ljh--6h_rk_8-5-rgb_front yes most likely it will
1ljh--6h_rk_9-5-rgb_front but it will also give you more club head speed
1lm_fpajm9g_0-5-rgb_front to accompany what we have been doing before along with the jumping the hopping the jump roping and everything else he is going to strengthen up his calves by just doing some simple calf raises
1mqciqetlk0_0-5-rgb_front right before our juice evaporates from all of our broccoli i am going to add this celery and i am adding celery last because i want to give our vegetables just a little bit of crunch because our chicken is going to be very soft so we will stir this around
1mqciqetlk0_1-5-rgb_front we have our sauce here and if you remember we did not add anything spicier than black pepper to it but it will have just a little bit of spice to it just a little bit of kick
1mqciqetlk0_2-5-rgb_front alright we are going to take our cinnamon rice the liquid has absorbed so we will plate this on and it should be just a little bit sticky with the sugar that we added and we will give our vegetables one last stir so i am going to put these kind of in layers so that we get some of the broccoli and then with the mushrooms and the celery over them and then some bright green broccoli on that and if you have any of that juice left you are going to want to dribble that right over the top of your broccoli
1mqciqetlk0_3-5-rgb_front alright now we will give our chicken a final stir and we will try to give our chicken a final stir and we will try to get a nice scoop of all the colors the reds the greens and the browns and we will try to make sure that we get a piece of basil over the top so that can be here
1mqciqetlk0_4-5-rgb_front so here we are our thai style basil with cinnamon rice and our soy and ginger broccoli
1mukbwc84da_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to discuss the types of customer service
1mukbwc84da_10-8-rgb_front when dealing with a customer with a difficult last name ask them how to pronounce it and tell them that you do not want to butcher or mispronounce their name
1mukbwc84da_11-8-rgb_front i found that this is a very handy icebreaker as some instances and also the customer appreciates you taking that extra time to make sure that you have your facts right
1mukbwc84da_12-8-rgb_front but again by using the customer is name you make the feel like more than just a number
1mukbwc84da_2-8-rgb_front another simple factor to consider when you are dealing with a customer over the phone use that customer is name
1mukbwc84da_3-8-rgb_front now when you use the customer is name what are you doing
1mukbwc84da_4-8-rgb_front first of all you are telling the customer that they are an individual nobody wants to be a number
1mukbwc84da_5-8-rgb_front do not you hate it and go into a place like i do not know dmv comes to mind
1mukbwc84da_6-8-rgb_front you pull a number and that is all you are to the person behind the counter
1mukbwc84da_7-8-rgb_front well the person who is calling you feels anonymous immediately because they are not face to face with you
1mukbwc84da_8-8-rgb_front one way to establish a relationship and it is a very simple low cost very quick method is just to repeat the customer is name
1mukbwc84da_9-8-rgb_front now in my experience i found that when you are dealing with a customer with a very difficult last name and believe me a lot of people have trouble with unruh
1mh04yzdfvg_0-5-rgb_front alright i have gone around uh to all four corners and squared them up and cleaned them up pretty good
1mh04yzdfvg_1-5-rgb_front i want to get little pieces of junk out and i cut a piece of uh quarter inch luon
1mh04yzdfvg_2-5-rgb_front this is a very thin plywood and i cut it to the same size as this so we are going to go ahead and just uh pop it in the bottom
1mh04yzdfvg_3-5-rgb_front it should fit real tight there you go you will probably have uh little bits of variations around here
1mh04yzdfvg_4-5-rgb_front it is not real critical uh sometimes you know just adjust adjustments of height and the way you hold the router and things like that will affect how this cut is made
1mh04yzdfvg_5-5-rgb_front i cut this bottom free hand on a band saw so the edges are not as straight as they would be if you cut it on a table saw but it still fits ok and it is the bottom so that is what it looks like from the inside
1mn7lz6xox4_0-5-rgb_front so now that we know what materials are needed we are ready to set up for our project
1mn7lz6xox4_1-5-rgb_front what we need for this part is our construction paper
1mn7lz6xox4_10-5-rgb_front this part of the process is really making the outline for the butterfly
1mn7lz6xox4_11-5-rgb_front so this is a great time for mom and child to sit figure out how they want their butterfly to look talk about the different designs of a butterfly what colors will they be using and go from there
1mn7lz6xox4_12-5-rgb_front this project should probably done be done on a big space like a kitchen table
1mn7lz6xox4_13-5-rgb_front you may even want to lay down some plastic table cloth just because there is glue involved there is the glitter paint and we want to have a nice clean space
1mn7lz6xox4_14-5-rgb_front remember that these are going to be going up in your house and you want to give some time and thought in to the project
1mn7lz6xox4_2-5-rgb_front i like to use the black paper
1mn7lz6xox4_3-5-rgb_front you can use a lighter colored paper
1mn7lz6xox4_4-5-rgb_front if you are using black we need a light colored pencil just to see the outline
1mn7lz6xox4_5-5-rgb_front for the lighter we can use anything
1mn7lz6xox4_6-5-rgb_front a marker a darker pencil all that works
1mn7lz6xox4_7-5-rgb_front for right now we want to put aside the glitter we want to put aside the sequence
1mn7lz6xox4_8-5-rgb_front we do not need our hanging materials
1mn7lz6xox4_9-5-rgb_front we do not even need our tissue paper at this point
1mpyws9facc_11-5-rgb_front but i found in the past that if i just take a few moments bring them in to what it is i am saying
1mpyws9facc_12-5-rgb_front let them know that i know they are being talkative and loud
1mpyws9facc_13-5-rgb_front let em know that people around em are aware that they are being talkative and loud
1mpyws9facc_14-5-rgb_front you will find most cases most and there are a few where i have had to use other tactics but the reality of it is once you do that most people do just what happened in this particular scenario i got involved with em they quieted
1mpyws9facc_15-5-rgb_front i let em know that in a few minutes i am done and we are off and running and away we go without trying to embarrass them in front of their peers
1mqg8ddpuis_0-8-rgb_front ok we are right around the green but you have hit a shot and now we have landed in this thick grass
1mqg8ddpuis_1-8-rgb_front so the thick grass does present more challenges than a nice fairway lie would or even that sand would because every type of grass is a little different and it depends on what time of day you are playing because in the morning the grass can be somewhat moist with dew which makes it a little heavier
1mqg8ddpuis_2-8-rgb_front other times it could be dried out later in the day so the key here is making sure that you follow through
1mqg8ddpuis_3-8-rgb_front you get the club head through the grass because if i do not follow through so let is say you can see that i am in some nice thick grass here
1mvvj9f775u_0-5-rgb_front now we are going to prepare the wheel for being attached to the wagon
1mvvj9f775u_1-5-rgb_front when we do that is we need to take a bead
1mvvj9f775u_10-5-rgb_front making the pile of disks thicker will let give the beads more space to lay on top of the disks and not touch each other because if they touch each other they will not be able to be laying flat so first of all apply we will put the first bead
1mvvj9f775u_11-5-rgb_front we will glue it in and set it into the disks and we will give it a minute or two to dry and then we will be able to turn it over and put the bead on the other side as well
1mvvj9f775u_12-5-rgb_front so just make sure that when you do glue the bead into the hole that you are lining it up properly so that the hole in the bead is sitting on top and that you will be able to put the wooden stick straight through
1mvvj9f775u_13-5-rgb_front once both beads are placed securely into the disks then we should just give it a few minutes to let it dry because we are going to have to place it on to the wooden sticks and the beads if they are not securely fastened onto the disks then they can pop off very easily
1mvvj9f775u_14-5-rgb_front so now i have shown you how to place the beads onto the disks so that we can place the disks on to the wooden sticks and they will be the wheels of the wagon
1mvvj9f775u_2-5-rgb_front it has to be a large bead and it is very important that we get the right size
1mvvj9f775u_3-5-rgb_front now we see that the hole in the disk is obviously too big to be able to sit on the thin wooden stick that is coming out of the wagon
1mvvj9f775u_4-5-rgb_front so this bead is going to make it so that we can put the entire wheel and have it sit on the wooden sticks so this bead is going to be glued to the disks and it is important that obviously the bead will fit onto the disks and will not go through the disks
1mvvj9f775u_5-5-rgb_front so it has to be big enough that it will still sit on the outside
1mvvj9f775u_6-5-rgb_front it will not go through the hole
1mvvj9f775u_7-5-rgb_front it is also important that the hole in the bead will be big enough to fit onto the wooden stick
1mvvj9f775u_8-5-rgb_front now if you find that the bead we are going to be placing the bead on each sides of the disks so if you find that the disk the pile of disks is not thick enough because the beads are hitting each other and not able to sit flat onto the disks
1mvvj9f775u_9-5-rgb_front you can always add on more disks to the pile
1nd0o3aeo1k_0-5-rgb_front right now what i would like to do is to start traveling through history with you and i have created this chart which will give you some idea of what i am talking about
1nd0o3aeo1k_1-5-rgb_front this is what i am calling the history of the roman alphabet
1nd0o3aeo1k_10-5-rgb_front so we are going to start with these
1nd0o3aeo1k_2-5-rgb_front as bearers of thought letters record reflect and sustain civilization
1nd0o3aeo1k_3-5-rgb_front all right we have just worked with the roman capitals
1nd0o3aeo1k_4-5-rgb_front the square capitals are a sort of a variation of the roman capitals that are considered the book hand whereas this was inscriptional right
1nd0o3aeo1k_5-5-rgb_front people making the letters into stone
1nd0o3aeo1k_6-5-rgb_front the square capitals was a book hand so they changed
1nd0o3aeo1k_7-5-rgb_front they were using reed for this
1nd0o3aeo1k_8-5-rgb_front and what i am going to zero in on right now is what we call the rustic capitals which is a book hand and actually even though this is a book hand these letters were also brushed onto stone to make posters for the public
1nd0o3aeo1k_9-5-rgb_front so some of these letters were discovered in pompeii
1ndbxrcrofc_0-5-rgb_front amanda claire now sometimes you might want to turn on or off more than one thing at a time or you might want to change position between more than one thing at a time
1ndbxrcrofc_1-5-rgb_front and so that is why they make switches a switch again can be either single throw as an or double throw in terms of but you can have multiple poles on it
1ndbxrcrofc_10-5-rgb_front so kinda like a tongue twister but that is how you can know what sort of switch you are getting
1ndbxrcrofc_2-5-rgb_front so this is a switch
1ndbxrcrofc_3-5-rgb_front it has two sets of terminals right two sets of contacts i do not know if you can see that it is pretty small but it has two sets of contacts and it still works as an switch but you can connect two different things to that switch and turn them both on and off
1ndbxrcrofc_4-5-rgb_front and then just lastly a switch again it has two different positions which is why it is double throw it is kind of an switch you can see this one here right
1ndbxrcrofc_5-5-rgb_front this is a big one
1ndbxrcrofc_6-5-rgb_front but again because there is different pairs you can put two can connect two different i guess routings of wires from that switch okay
1ndbxrcrofc_7-5-rgb_front so then just a last thing i will say about these switches is that when you buy them there is a little code that is used
1ndbxrcrofc_8-5-rgb_front it is spst for single pole single throw spdt single pole double throw
1ndbxrcrofc_9-5-rgb_front dpst double pole single throw and dpdt double pole double throw
1nsanqj8as4_0-5-rgb_front this style is collar is called a notched collar with a blanket stitch
1nsanqj8as4_1-5-rgb_front now we have seen many many times the notched collar aspect of it comes in here and here
1nsanqj8as4_10-5-rgb_front you cannot see that because that would be like a
1nsanqj8as4_11-5-rgb_front but that is the type of stitch used all along the outer edges to have it be a notched collar with a blanket stitch
1nsanqj8as4_2-5-rgb_front remember this is all one piece when it is sewn together because you are going to have it sewn together here
1nsanqj8as4_3-5-rgb_front the blanket stitch comes from what you do as an
1nsanqj8as4_4-5-rgb_front the blanket stitch is going to be along every edge of your fabric every outer edge
1nsanqj8as4_5-5-rgb_front and think about those a blanket is stitch is what it sounds like
1nsanqj8as4_6-5-rgb_front it is stitching that is done on like say you have one of those fleece blankets you watch tv on your couch with
1nsanqj8as4_7-5-rgb_front a blanket stitch look at the end of that blanket it curves and loops up into it
1nsanqj8as4_8-5-rgb_front you will see if you are looking at it flat on you will see from this top looking at it that it curves like that
1nsanqj8as4_9-5-rgb_front and then from the side you will also see that there is a stitch right there preventing the fraying
1ndncbn6-f4_0-3-rgb_front hi
1ndncbn6-f4_1-3-rgb_front jim dowd at zoar outdoor
1ndncbn6-f4_10-3-rgb_front different manufacturers have different configurations but basically umpqua orvis frog hair and others make wonderful leaders
1ndncbn6-f4_11-3-rgb_front make sure you start out with knotless
1ndncbn6-f4_12-3-rgb_front when you buy the leader it is a good idea to buy a spool of tippet which is the same diameter as the end of the leader
1ndncbn6-f4_13-3-rgb_front and a little bit later i will show you a knot that you can use to connect new sections of leader as you replace the end when it gets chewed up by a trout if you are changing flies and so on
1ndncbn6-f4_3-3-rgb_front in all of the presentations seen so far been casting with a foot leader which connects the fly line through a thick section at the end of the leader at the fly line and tapers all the way down through feet to a thin section that goes to the fly or in this case the yarn fly
1ndncbn6-f4_4-3-rgb_front what this does is it provides a relatively invisible connection between you and the fish
1ndncbn6-f4_5-3-rgb_front the taper allows the momentum to carry forward right down the fly line through the leader and into the fly
1ndncbn6-f4_6-3-rgb_front a good general purpose selection to begin with would be a foot leader because a relatively short leader is easier to use it turns over the momentum much better
1ndncbn6-f4_7-3-rgb_front so here for example this is a foot knotless leader
1ndncbn6-f4_8-3-rgb_front the strength on this leader is about pound test
1ndncbn6-f4_9-3-rgb_front this on the other hand is a foot leader which is pound test
1nnjqlli_6s_3-8-rgb_front it is a history a living history paper paper paper
1nnjqlli_6s_4-8-rgb_front just make sure that you take care of your paper because just like every other piece of collectibles condition is everything so pieces that are torn or damaged or water soiled the value just goes down dramatically so it is all about condition so enjoy your paper and treat it with kindness
1nnjqlli_6s_5-8-rgb_front i am jan see ya
1npqw3j6-w0_0-8-rgb_front hi i am jennifer cail
1npqw3j6-w0_10-8-rgb_front you will probably need to scrape the bowl down at least once will beating it to make sure to get all of the butter off
1npqw3j6-w0_11-8-rgb_front now it is ready for the next step
1npqw3j6-w0_2-8-rgb_front now that our butter has been creamed it is time to add the next ingredients
1npqw3j6-w0_3-8-rgb_front we are going to add of a cup of sugar you happen to have an odd size cup measuring cup that is always much easier to work with
1npqw3j6-w0_4-8-rgb_front otherwise you will use your half cup and your cup to measure and you just want to scoop the sugar into your cup
1npqw3j6-w0_5-8-rgb_front it is granulated sugar so you do not have to worry about packing it down or not
1npqw3j6-w0_6-8-rgb_front then pour it into your butter mixture or the creamed butter
1npqw3j6-w0_7-8-rgb_front we are going to start your mixer on a lower speed to just start incorporating a little bit this is going to cause it to be almost like clumps of butter surrounded by the sugar
1npqw3j6-w0_8-8-rgb_front then you are going to turn the mixer up just a little bit
1npqw3j6-w0_9-8-rgb_front now with our butter and sugar fully incorporated you can see that it is a nice fluffy consistency
1nsgtf3dlio_10-8-rgb_front you just want to cut it in half
1nsgtf3dlio_11-8-rgb_front now we have got halves
1nsgtf3dlio_12-8-rgb_front once again you can go ahead and just wrap one of these up and save it for later or go ahead and squeeze them both now
1nsgtf3dlio_13-8-rgb_front we have got a juicer
1nsgtf3dlio_14-8-rgb_front you just want to press down
1nsgtf3dlio_15-8-rgb_front as we press down turn either counterclockwise or clockwise
1nsgtf3dlio_16-8-rgb_front it is up to you
1nsgtf3dlio_17-8-rgb_front we have got a strainer to catch all of the seeds and some of the pulp so that is good
1nsgtf3dlio_18-8-rgb_front you just want to squeeze
1nsgtf3dlio_19-8-rgb_front then what you want to do is you want to squeeze the edges of the lemon because as you are squeezing the lemon itself a lot of the pulp comes out to the edges
1nsgtf3dlio_20-8-rgb_front you want to make sure you squeeze all of it
1nsgtf3dlio_21-8-rgb_front keep turning
1nsgtf3dlio_22-8-rgb_front discard this give it a nice twist and there you go
1nsgtf3dlio_23-8-rgb_front fresh lemon juice
1nsgtf3dlio_7-8-rgb_front you just want to roll it
1nsgtf3dlio_8-8-rgb_front now you can see the lemon is kind of soft
1nsgtf3dlio_9-8-rgb_front give it a good squeeze
1nurocjdjm4_0-8-rgb_front this is oak at painted temple tattoo and if you are looking to become an apprentice to learn how to tattoo do not attempt it yourself
1nurocjdjm4_1-8-rgb_front do not think you know what you are doing by watching some sitcom on tv about some people tattooing
1nurocjdjm4_14-8-rgb_front do not just think you know what you are doing and try to wing it
1nurocjdjm4_2-8-rgb_front it is not sufficient
1nurocjdjm4_3-8-rgb_front you need to go learn from somebody who is sufficient in the tattooing field
1nurocjdjm4_4-8-rgb_front if you are a good artist maybe you want to apply your art to skin or tattooing
1nurocjdjm4_5-8-rgb_front if you are serious about it then go learn from somebody who knows what they are doing
1o3brzq7ayy_0-8-rgb_front today we are going to talk about how to pick out a fresh kiwi
1o3brzq7ayy_1-8-rgb_front when looking for a fresh kiwi it kind of depends on whether you like them a little bit softer or whether you like them a little bit more firm
1o3brzq7ayy_10-8-rgb_front if you are really not sure about which kind of kiwi you are going to enjoy like i said the ones that are a little more golden like that are going to be a little bit more tender or a little bit more solid sorry a little bit more firm and the darker ones are going to be a little bit more squishy
1o3brzq7ayy_11-8-rgb_front if you are really not sure which one you like you can ask the produce manager at the farm market to take them to the back and cut one open for you or cut them both open for you and he will give you a taste test and you can go off of that judgment as to which ones you are going to come out here and pick for yourself to take home
1ojx7vfnr6w_0-8-rgb_front hi i am emily larew and we are working on our intermediate tap steps
1ojx7vfnr6w_1-8-rgb_front we are going to take a look at how to do a triple drawback
1ojx7vfnr6w_10-8-rgb_front those were your single double and triple drawbacks all combined after you learn your triple drawback
1ojx7vfnr6w_2-8-rgb_front so remember if you looked previously at our double drawbacks we just added another heel
1ojx7vfnr6w_3-8-rgb_front so this time we have three heels okay
1ojx7vfnr6w_4-8-rgb_front so knees bent weight forward we are going to do brush heel step front back so that is your three heel sounds
1ojx7vfnr6w_5-8-rgb_front brush heel step front back one more time brush heel step front back
1ojx7vfnr6w_6-8-rgb_front again keep your body and your tap steps like right underneath your body because otherwise it is going to be really hard to make it fast
1ojx7vfnr6w_7-8-rgb_front brush heel step front back brush heel step front back brush heel step front back brush heel step front back da da da da da alright
1ojx7vfnr6w_8-8-rgb_front so if we want to go ahead and add like a combination with our singles doubles and triples we would do it like this
1ojx7vfnr6w_9-8-rgb_front and a one two three four five six seven eight awesome
1ourlz-4xeo_0-8-rgb_front there are many different types of mountain bikes that you can take our for general ride in the woods
1ourlz-4xeo_1-8-rgb_front today i have chosen one specific type that i might make my ride a little bit more challenging in some of the other bikes that you could choose
1ourlz-4xeo_11-8-rgb_front you can ride a bike and learn maybe more of the back then a bike that cost because the bike is not you know correcting so many of your mistakes
1ourlz-4xeo_2-8-rgb_front my bike has no suspension in the front not suspension in the rear it does have a full set of gears and really good brakes
1ourlz-4xeo_3-8-rgb_front but this bike not having any suspension in the front of the rear you know other bikes has springs and damper up to like inches of travel that people use for this sort of application
1ourlz-4xeo_4-8-rgb_front but having suspension allows you to do is take lines that are rougher it keeps your bike more stable and level in rough terrain and it keeps your tires on the ground so you can get better tractions so you can brake later you can turn harder and all that other sort of stuff
1o_x7nnw-ha_0-5-rgb_front hi i am richard goms
1o_x7nnw-ha_1-5-rgb_front we are here in salt lake city utah
1o_x7nnw-ha_10-5-rgb_front another way if you are looking for the birth date of a deceased person there are a number of sources
1o_x7nnw-ha_11-5-rgb_front there is the social security death index
1o_x7nnw-ha_12-5-rgb_front there is the state in which they died or the state in which they were born
1o_x7nnw-ha_13-5-rgb_front there is the newspaper announcements of their birth and of their death that might list their birth date
1o_x7nnw-ha_14-5-rgb_front there is a variety of different ways of finding out a birth date of a deceased person

1o_x7nnw-ha_3-5-rgb_front there area a number of ways of doing this for both living and deceased persons
1o_x7nnw-ha_4-5-rgb_front you could go on line to google com you could put in whatever information you know about the person it may bring up information such as their birth date
1o_x7nnw-ha_5-5-rgb_front you could go on a number of different search engines myspace blogger facebook
1o_x7nnw-ha_6-5-rgb_front you can then type in information to get to their profile and find out their birth date from their profile
1o_x7nnw-ha_7-5-rgb_front there is a website called classmates com
1o_x7nnw-ha_8-5-rgb_front you do need to be a classmate in order to get the information
1o_x7nnw-ha_9-5-rgb_front you need to create your own profile and graduate from that same school in order to get the information on your classmates
1oj0xmgomqc_0-8-rgb_front the binding is the device that physically holds you to the snowboard
1oj0xmgomqc_1-8-rgb_front the binding pretty much looks a lot like this
1oj0xmgomqc_10-8-rgb_front you are going to use a hard plastic boot
1oj0xmgomqc_2-8-rgb_front it has either a bone out strap and a strap that goes over your toe
1oj0xmgomqc_3-8-rgb_front it might have a bone out strap with a toe strap like this that goes over the end of your toes
1oj0xmgomqc_4-8-rgb_front it might have one pad on top for both the bone out and the toe and your high back will fold down so you can enter through the back
1oj0xmgomqc_5-8-rgb_front it might not have any straps on it what so ever
1oj0xmgomqc_6-8-rgb_front in which those are called step ins
1oj0xmgomqc_7-8-rgb_front you have a prong on the side of your boot
1oj0xmgomqc_8-8-rgb_front they might not even be snowboard bindings at all if you have an alpine or racing board because yours are going to look a lot similar to a ski binding
1oj0xmgomqc_9-8-rgb_front flat to the board and you are not going to use a snowboarding boot
1ot-mwxotuq_0-8-rgb_front we just stretched out the hips so let is balance now our center or our core
1ot-mwxotuq_1-8-rgb_front so julie is going to lift up out of pigeon pose swing that right leg around as you shift the weight into the left hip
1ot-mwxotuq_10-8-rgb_front at any time if you feel pressure on the low back bend the knees or clasp the hands around the back side of the knees to release that pressure keeping the energy focused on the abdominals
1ot-mwxotuq_11-8-rgb_front that is great
1ot-mwxotuq_2-8-rgb_front then i am going to place a blanket underneath the tail bone for this next position
1ot-mwxotuq_3-8-rgb_front you may or may not need the blanket
1ot-mwxotuq_4-8-rgb_front so you are going to bring the knees towards the chest lift the heart towards the sky and then lean back a little bit lifting the feet off the floor a tiny degree
1ot-mwxotuq_5-8-rgb_front so that is one variation
1ot-mwxotuq_6-8-rgb_front if you would like you can straighten the legs completely
1ot-mwxotuq_7-8-rgb_front this is boat pose or navasana
1ot-mwxotuq_8-8-rgb_front it is very trying on that center so breath deeply trying to keep the chest up pretend that there is a nice candle and a flame flickering behind you and you want to lift away from that flame
1ot-mwxotuq_9-8-rgb_front so you are keeping your boat out of the water keeping the legs extended
1oxari6ijp4_0-8-rgb_front ok now we are going to be using the seven iron which is this one is thirty six degree loft which means you can see that it is angles pretty substantially still
1oxari6ijp4_1-8-rgb_front so this club as we go down the clubs are going to be hitting the ball further and further
1oxari6ijp4_2-8-rgb_front so a seven iron is going to hit the ball further than an eight iron further than a nine iron
1oxari6ijp4_3-8-rgb_front so this club for most good recreational players they are hitting it from a hundred and forty to about one hundred and seventy
1oxari6ijp4_4-8-rgb_front and the big variation is some players are stronger some are taller some have better swings and so on and so forth
1oxari6ijp4_5-8-rgb_front but this club is very useful once again so if you are not a four hundred yard power for and you have hit a two hundred fifty yard drive you have got a seven iron for most players into the green
1oxari6ijp4_6-8-rgb_front so this shot is the shot that really can make or break the hole
1oxari6ijp4_7-8-rgb_front so if this shot is accurate you have a good chance of making a putt in one or two putts
1ozbobbc4bw_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to be talking about buying a new car
1ozbobbc4bw_10-8-rgb_front so make sure that you find out exactly what you are needs are when it comes to a new automobile purchase before you go out and invest your time in looking at a new car

1ozbobbc4bw_13-8-rgb_front get online and find out about your car and what kind of safety ratings it has and what kind of other options and benefits the car provides that you are most interested in
1ozbobbc4bw_14-8-rgb_front again doing research will save you a lot of time in the long run so do not forget to do it
1ozbobbc4bw_2-8-rgb_front in this segment we are going to be talking about researching your new car purchase
1ozbobbc4bw_3-8-rgb_front anytime you go out and purchase a new product be sure that you find out the most that you can to avoid any mishaps or problems
1ozbobbc4bw_4-8-rgb_front in this case what that means to you is so that you are not wasting your time and everyone else is time

1ozbobbc4bw_6-8-rgb_front make sure that car offers you the gas mileage you are looking for and it also offers you the features you are looking for
1ozbobbc4bw_7-8-rgb_front if you are needing something in a larger suv type do not go look at a honda cause they do not offer a large suv
1ozbobbc4bw_8-8-rgb_front go look at another manufacturer that offers a large suv
1ozbobbc4bw_9-8-rgb_front if you have got kids you may want to go look at a van or a minivan
1p0ncpuaqqu_0-8-rgb_front okay so now that we have our disc we are going to take it back out of the kiln and light up our torch and get it hot again and then i am going to take the parallel mashers here and we are going to try to mash it flat
1p0ncpuaqqu_1-8-rgb_front now using a marver like i did there will help your glass like i said keep its color as opposed to letting the flame do all the work for you because the flame can do what i just did and ball the glass up into a disc or a glob but you run the risk of burning the colors actually out of the glass so using your instruments definitely helps the colors stay
1p0ncpuaqqu_2-8-rgb_front alright so we have got this pretty hot and now i am going to smash it down kind of shape it here
1p0ncpuaqqu_3-8-rgb_front alright see that is still pretty thick in there and that is what we want and we have got enough area here to get us a nice stringer
1p0ncpuaqqu_4-8-rgb_front alright so we have flattened it out flattened our disc
1p0oky4fnyi_0-8-rgb_front hi
1p0oky4fnyi_10-8-rgb_front we got this by adding the numbers together and thee sticking the answer in the middle
1p0oky4fnyi_11-8-rgb_front let is try a little bit harder now
1p0oky4fnyi_12-8-rgb_front
1p0oky4fnyi_13-8-rgb_front we know that but is a little too big to go in the middle
1p0oky4fnyi_14-8-rgb_front what we do is we keep the in the middle and carry the over to the first number which makes it
1p0oky4fnyi_15-8-rgb_front now we have
1p0oky4fnyi_16-8-rgb_front whenever you are doing math in your head the most important part is being able to visualize the numbers
1p0oky4fnyi_17-8-rgb_front the more you practice the better you are going to get
1p0oky4fnyi_2-8-rgb_front most people know the trick for finding multiplied by a single digit
1p0oky4fnyi_3-8-rgb_front for example
1p0oky4fnyi_4-8-rgb_front it gets a little more difficult when we want to multiply by digit numbers
1p0oky4fnyi_5-8-rgb_front let is take as our example
1p0oky4fnyi_6-8-rgb_front the first step is to take and separate the and into two separate numbers
1p0oky4fnyi_7-8-rgb_front then we want to add and together to equal
1p0oky4fnyi_8-8-rgb_front goes right between the and the
1p0oky4fnyi_9-8-rgb_front is the answer
1p6n7tv8oco_0-8-rgb_front hey welcome to my studio everybody
1p6n7tv8oco_1-8-rgb_front my name is lars erik robinson
1p6n7tv8oco_10-8-rgb_front so her face was angled a little bit this way
1p6n7tv8oco_11-8-rgb_front so when i went to go draw her body with that i actually did
1p6n7tv8oco_12-8-rgb_front i have her actually turn in the same direction as the face is and having to try to create a movement with her
1p6n7tv8oco_13-8-rgb_front and the reason i put the arm here with the body is you want to be able to have an between the bigger head and the smaller body by having maybe something come out perspective
1p6n7tv8oco_14-8-rgb_front coming right at you
1p6n7tv8oco_15-8-rgb_front and then one going back
1p6n7tv8oco_16-8-rgb_front so you can tell here this arm is bigger than this one here
1p6n7tv8oco_17-8-rgb_front so it gives it a little bit more understanding that you are actually right there with them
1p6n7tv8oco_18-8-rgb_front on him you know i wanted to create a powerful look and having just the buttons pop out just like superman use to do it
1p6n7tv8oco_19-8-rgb_front and you try to create a dimension by having his legs go back
1p6n7tv8oco_2-8-rgb_front my company is larser arts all around
1p6n7tv8oco_20-8-rgb_front so if that explains to you guys a little bit more how you relate bodies with the bigger heads
1p6n7tv8oco_21-8-rgb_front basically sometimes you do not even have to show their neck that much you could just show the shoulders here
1p6n7tv8oco_22-8-rgb_front especially on guys with big shoulder muscles
1p6n7tv8oco_23-8-rgb_front and then i hope that explains a little bit to you more about what we go through as an artist to get our bodies on your caricatures
1p6n7tv8oco_24-8-rgb_front thank you guys so much
1p6n7tv8oco_3-8-rgb_front you might wonder when you see caricatures in a theme park or at the pier somewhere how do they figure out how to put the body is on these caricatures and how they figure how to do the different poses for them
1p6n7tv8oco_4-8-rgb_front well obviously what i drew for these two people here they did not have these poses like this
1p6n7tv8oco_5-8-rgb_front so i try to think about how there personalities are and they tell me about what they like and sometimes you just ask the client what are the kinds of things that you are interested in
1p6n7tv8oco_6-8-rgb_front and usually they would tell you oh i love wonder woman or i love superman
1p6n7tv8oco_7-8-rgb_front okay you can go from there and illustrate that
1p6n7tv8oco_8-8-rgb_front so how am i going to create wonder woman in her pose
1p6n7tv8oco_9-8-rgb_front and how am i going to have that relate to how her picture is
1pczfhknc_s_0-8-rgb_front determining your skin type is easy and can help you in choosing cosmetics moisturizers and cleansing products that are right for your type of skin
1pczfhknc_s_1-8-rgb_front i am jackie silver with aging backwards with how to determine your skin type
1pczfhknc_s_10-8-rgb_front a tight feeling or flaky skin residue that is not oily indicates dry skin type
1pczfhknc_s_11-8-rgb_front remember it is easy to determine your skin type with just a few tissues and a keen eye
1pczfhknc_s_12-8-rgb_front i am jackie silver with how to determine your skin type
1pczfhknc_s_13-8-rgb_front stay beautiful
1pczfhknc_s_2-8-rgb_front wash your face with a mild cleanser rinse it and pat dry
1pczfhknc_s_3-8-rgb_front wait about one hour note whether your face feels tight
1pczfhknc_s_4-8-rgb_front press a tissue onto your chin and look for an oily residue or a flaky skin residue
1pczfhknc_s_5-8-rgb_front repeat the process with a new tissue each time on the center of your cheeks your outer cheeks the center of your forehead outer forehead and your nose
1pczfhknc_s_6-8-rgb_front oil on each tissue indicates an oily skin type
1pczfhknc_s_7-8-rgb_front while oil on some of the tissues such as the t zone which is the center of the forehead the chin nose and center of the cheeks indicates combination skin
1pczfhknc_s_8-8-rgb_front most of us have combination
1pczfhknc_s_9-8-rgb_front no oily or flaky residue of any kind indicates normal skin
1pd7hxermbm_0-8-rgb_front this next exercise goes along with one of the previous exercises the
1pd7hxermbm_1-8-rgb_front this is for the abductors your inner tight muscles
1pd7hxermbm_10-8-rgb_front go for it
1pd7hxermbm_2-8-rgb_front it is important to work with this exercise because it will help give you balance and support especially in other exercises down the road
1pd7hxermbm_3-8-rgb_front also your abductors coincide in a support mechanism with the obliques
1pd7hxermbm_4-8-rgb_front so if you are looking for some nice abs doing these inner tight muscles will help it along
1pd7hxermbm_5-8-rgb_front go ahead sit on the machine and make sure your pelvis is against the back of the seat
1pd7hxermbm_6-8-rgb_front then lift the lever and slide the stirrups out as wide as you can with a comfortableness in your legs
1pd7hxermbm_7-8-rgb_front do not go too wide but go wide enough so you can feel that your inner tight muscles are stretching as far as the can without any discomfort
1pd7hxermbm_8-8-rgb_front then as you close your knees together and your feet together be sure to exhale and tighten up your abdominals
1pd7hxermbm_9-8-rgb_front all the while try to remain nice and tall through your spine as you work and keep refirming contractions through your abdominals as you close your legs
1peszk6bzqm_0-5-rgb_front this is standard relaxation therapy for the ears
1peszk6bzqm_1-5-rgb_front that is right the ears
1peszk6bzqm_2-5-rgb_front a lot of people do not get their ears massaged during a massage but if you think about it unless you have got specific sensitivity to your ears gentle stroking of the ears the ear lobe can be incredibly relaxing
1peszk6bzqm_3-5-rgb_front and even gentle tugging on the ears starting at the tops tugging out and down towards the table in this case a little bit
1peszk6bzqm_4-5-rgb_front what this helps to do is all of these muscles that come up into the back of the head even the ones from the face tugging on the ears that way and massaging the ears actually helps to loosen a lot of those muscles
1peszk6bzqm_5-5-rgb_front and ties directly into the central nervous system
1peszk6bzqm_6-5-rgb_front it can create an extremely extremely relaxing effect for the person
1peszk6bzqm_7-5-rgb_front and that is going to be general relaxation therapy for the ears
1pmwfe-n3_k_1-8-rgb_front for sarah we are going to do square with a rounded edge
1pmwfe-n3_k_10-8-rgb_front then i am filing the tip
1pmwfe-n3_k_11-8-rgb_front this is how you file the nails after you have applied the acrylic
1pmwfe-n3_k_12-8-rgb_front after you have done the first five you are just going to do the same to the other hand
1pmwfe-n3_k_13-8-rgb_front and then just hold them out and make sure that they match up evenly
1pmwfe-n3_k_2-8-rgb_front that way she is got the durability of square in her everyday life of the things that she picks up especially being that she is a trainer and has to pick up weights
1pmwfe-n3_k_3-8-rgb_front the rounded edge we are going to give her on the corners is just so she does not scratch herself scratch any of her clients or tear any of her clothes or pantyhose
1pmwfe-n3_k_4-8-rgb_front you could also do a round nail
1pmwfe-n3_k_5-8-rgb_front you could do a straight square nail where you have pointy ends
1pmwfe-n3_k_6-8-rgb_front or you could have an oval nail which is tapered at the top
1pmwfe-n3_k_7-8-rgb_front hold on to your nail file so that it does not come flying out your hand like it just did
1pmwfe-n3_k_8-8-rgb_front what i am doing is just making sure that there is not any acrylic or glue stuck on to her skin
1pmwfe-n3_k_9-8-rgb_front i am filing the sides first to make sure that they come out straight
1po6_voqxoc_0-8-rgb_front from warrior i we are going to continue through the sun salutation
1po6_voqxoc_1-8-rgb_front so we are in warrior i the inhale is going to be to invite both palms to the earth and the exhale is going to invite the left foot back into plank high plank
1po6_voqxoc_2-8-rgb_front now we are looking to have the hips directly in line with the shoulders
1po6_voqxoc_3-8-rgb_front oftentimes people need to lift their hips because they just do not have the core stability
1po6_voqxoc_4-8-rgb_front we can do this here lengthening out the crown of your head draw from the front of your body top of the pubis right through the sternum right through draw that in for strength
1po6_voqxoc_5-8-rgb_front the next thing that you are able to do is release the knees
1po6_voqxoc_6-8-rgb_front this is going to make the pose more available to you
1po6_voqxoc_7-8-rgb_front she still needs to lengthen through the crown of her head
1po6_voqxoc_8-8-rgb_front and if it is still too much work for the lower back for the abs she is going to walk her knees in even closer coming into table but still have some work going on in the shoulders
1po6_voqxoc_9-8-rgb_front she is still asking the core of her body to do some work
1pafdifuspu_0-5-rgb_front to get you started you are going to need a nail file
1pafdifuspu_1-5-rgb_front for a natural nail you are going to want to use a grit
1pafdifuspu_2-5-rgb_front for an acrylic or gel nail you are going to want to use something a little rougher
1pafdifuspu_3-5-rgb_front there is also grits
1pafdifuspu_4-5-rgb_front there is grits
1pafdifuspu_5-5-rgb_front you can also find these at your local supply store
1pafdifuspu_6-5-rgb_front you are also going to need a buffer
1pafdifuspu_7-5-rgb_front they come in white buffing box also known as polar blocks
1pafdifuspu_8-5-rgb_front you are going to need one with a fine side and a rough side
1pafdifuspu_9-5-rgb_front it is to buff the nail and make sure there are no lines or ridges in the nail
1pesvvh-lr4_10-8-rgb_front and once they have that completed they add any minor alterations that need to be done just a little bit of this color a little bit of that color until they dial it in perfectly and that is how they do it
1phhbwerk9q_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about the rule of thirds
1phhbwerk9q_1-8-rgb_front the rule of thirds is basically is a compositional rule of thumb
1phhbwerk9q_10-8-rgb_front instead of just putting the subject in the dead center of your frame
1phhbwerk9q_11-8-rgb_front now technically the dead center is used to make a point
1phhbwerk9q_12-8-rgb_front in terms of photography and video and painting
1phhbwerk9q_13-8-rgb_front and if you put an object in the dead center it is supposed to be the clear focal point
1phhbwerk9q_14-8-rgb_front it is supposed to be sort of a power pose in my mind
1phhbwerk9q_15-8-rgb_front it is looks like more imposing
1phhbwerk9q_16-8-rgb_front if you throw someone or something into the right corner or the left corner
1phhbwerk9q_17-8-rgb_front as the case maybe
1phhbwerk9q_18-8-rgb_front it changes everything
1phhbwerk9q_19-8-rgb_front it makes it a little bit more visually pleasing
1phhbwerk9q_2-8-rgb_front in photography painting art and any sort of visual medium
1phhbwerk9q_20-8-rgb_front and it is not really clear exactly why this is
1phhbwerk9q_21-8-rgb_front it is just the human brain and the human eye
1phhbwerk9q_22-8-rgb_front this point has been trained to accept that this is the correct and most visually pleasing way to frame your picture or drawing
1phhbwerk9q_23-8-rgb_front as the case may be
1phhbwerk9q_24-8-rgb_front so while framing is largely a relative thing
1phhbwerk9q_25-8-rgb_front and if you decide to be off on guard
1phhbwerk9q_26-8-rgb_front and you know break all the rules
1phhbwerk9q_27-8-rgb_front you can frame your drawings any way you like
1phhbwerk9q_28-8-rgb_front however if you want to be taken seriously
1phhbwerk9q_29-8-rgb_front you will follow the principle of the rule of thirds
1phhbwerk9q_3-8-rgb_front it essentially is basically this
1phhbwerk9q_30-8-rgb_front always keeping in mind your nine separate framing boxes
1phhbwerk9q_31-8-rgb_front in your drawings designs photographs whatever
1phhbwerk9q_32-8-rgb_front that is essentially what the rule of thirds is
1phhbwerk9q_4-8-rgb_front you draw two imaginary lines vertically
1phhbwerk9q_5-8-rgb_front and two imaginary lines horizontally in an image
1phhbwerk9q_6-8-rgb_front drawing these lines creates nine separate boxes in an image
1phhbwerk9q_7-8-rgb_front and the idea is by aligning your the focus of your design or drawing or video
1phhbwerk9q_8-8-rgb_front within one of these nine boxes
1phhbwerk9q_9-8-rgb_front you are creating a more visually aesthetically pleasing shot or image or painting
1pm6ty_jrpu_0-3-rgb_front the drink we are about to make is a banana rum cream
1pm6ty_jrpu_1-3-rgb_front the first thing we are going to do is put some ice in a glass here and we are going to do one shot of dark rum any dark rum will do hey watch out
1pm6ty_jrpu_2-3-rgb_front follow it up with a half a shot of creme de banana there we go to give it that nice banana flavor and the last thing we are going to do is add about a shot of light cream and let is mix this all together and any time you add a creme de banana it is going to have a really nice strong smelling banana scent to it and we will get it all mixed together get it all nice and frothy with the cream set up a glass
1pm6ty_jrpu_3-3-rgb_front pour that nice frothy drink in there there we go give it a straw and bottoms up
1pmwoojteiw_1-8-rgb_front what we want to talk about is how to keep our receivers in a position to make an easy catch and be able to score for your team
1pmwoojteiw_10-8-rgb_front you want to catch it real soft into our hands and bring in to you
1pmwoojteiw_11-8-rgb_front imagine this was made of glass and you are really trying to protect it
1pmwoojteiw_12-8-rgb_front you want to catch it and bring it in
1pmwoojteiw_13-8-rgb_front we are going to show you what it looks like when our receiver comes across and catches the ball chest high or above
1pmwoojteiw_14-8-rgb_front you can see he does a great job of getting his hands out he does not go get the ball he lets the ball come to him nice and soft cradles it turns it up field looking for the touchdown
1pmwoojteiw_2-8-rgb_front first we have to run a good pattern
1pmwoojteiw_3-8-rgb_front after the guy runs a good pattern and gets open and the quarterback makes a good throw we have to make sure we make the catch
1pmwoojteiw_4-8-rgb_front i want to talk about one strategy of making a catch
1pmwoojteiw_5-8-rgb_front when the quarterback throws the ball at the chest or higher you have to go up and make the catch with your hands
1pmwoojteiw_6-8-rgb_front you cannot try to make a catch to the side with a cradle hand position
1pmwoojteiw_7-8-rgb_front if it is thrown over the top of you then you can cradle it behind you
1pmwoojteiw_8-8-rgb_front but if it is thrown right to you you have to go out with your hands
1pmwoojteiw_9-8-rgb_front you do not want to go get the ball because alot of times it you will hit the ball and it will ricochet off your hands
1pwvyt44-ue_0-8-rgb_front hi i am arthur noxon president of acoustic sciences
1pwvyt44-ue_1-8-rgb_front right now we are going to talk about how to make an acoustic barrier
1pwvyt44-ue_17-8-rgb_front when you are using a product like this you have bass isolation because of the weight and you have treble isolation because of the glass
1pwvyt44-ue_18-8-rgb_front now the bass is isolated but it is reflected back into the area that it came from because this amount of material is not enough to absorb much bass inches of fiberglass only absorbs down to about a half an octave below middle c so a gobo that reflects bass remember it keeps the bass inside of the recording space where the bass was coming from so it causes more bass to be inside the gobo space
1pwvyt44-ue_19-8-rgb_front okay
1pwvyt44-ue_2-8-rgb_front now the purpose of this barrier is to be inside of a home studio
1pwvyt44-ue_20-8-rgb_front this is an interesting version this is more of a finished product but it is a form of a gobo
1pwvyt44-ue_21-8-rgb_front a hard heavy interior core but with absorption on both sides
1pwvyt44-ue_22-8-rgb_front now you have an instrument here and an instrument here you have got a bass barrier between the instruments and you have a treble range absorber on either side
1pwvyt44-ue_23_24-8-rgb_front so that is the typical gobo assembly and in our case we take a piece of by we make a little notch here and a little notch here take a piece of medite or we can take a piece of hardy board or backer board glue it into the notch and you have a frame with a bass barrier in the middle that is holding it all together and then you have absorption on either side of it and then cover it with fabric staple the fabric on and you are done
1pwvyt44-ue_3-8-rgb_front and now the second purpose of a barrier is usually to separate one instrument from another instrument so that the mics associated with recording one instrument are not picking up bleed from the next door neighbor these are typically called gobos
1pwvyt44-ue_4-8-rgb_front and so now a gobo is there is different kinds of gobos and so the first and most common one would be a sound absorbing gobo
1pwvyt44-ue_5-8-rgb_front so this is inch air conditioning duct board
1pwvyt44-ue_6-8-rgb_front this is a sound absorbing panel inches is the minimum thickness that we use in our company
1pyzfkullti_0-8-rgb_front ok now that we have the parsley seeds planted and covered
1pyzfkullti_1-8-rgb_front were going to water them in and we can t always count on rain
1pyzfkullti_10-8-rgb_front so we want to make sure it s watered in really really good
1pyzfkullti_11-8-rgb_front now depending on the size of your patch
1pyzfkullti_12-8-rgb_front depends on how many buckets you want to pull in
1pyzfkullti_13-8-rgb_front ok there we go that will do it
1pyzfkullti_2-8-rgb_front in the middle of tennessee here we have lots of rain here this spring but were having about four to five to six days of no rain and i want to make sure that these parsley seeds come up
1pyzfkullti_3-8-rgb_front so i am going to water them in really good
1pyzfkullti_4-8-rgb_front this insures that the germination will happen and we will have a successful crop of fresh parsley for the table
1pyzfkullti_5-8-rgb_front in our house we eat lots and lots of parsley
1pyzfkullti_6-8-rgb_front parsley goes into our pates
1pyzfkullti_7-8-rgb_front parsley goes into our salads
1pyzfkullti_8-8-rgb_front parsley goes into crackers that we make
1pyzfkullti_9-8-rgb_front we eat lots and lots of parsley
1q1bxwgurra_1-8-rgb_front i am with landscape restorations in miami florida
1q1bxwgurra_10-8-rgb_front it will get too big for the location and it will eventually get to be a real hazard especially in a wind storm
1q1bxwgurra_11-8-rgb_front here in miami we have hurricanes tornadoes and other things
1q1bxwgurra_12-8-rgb_front wrong plant wrong place
1q1bxwgurra_13-8-rgb_front beware of what happens when the trees grow up
1q1bxwgurra_14-8-rgb_front this will also drop palm fronds right into a parking lot right into a drive way
1q1bxwgurra_15-8-rgb_front be careful
1q1bxwgurra_2-8-rgb_front we are here at palm hammock orchid estate and we are talking about planting and fertilizing
1q1bxwgurra_3-8-rgb_front the title of this clip is trees and puppies grow up
1q1bxwgurra_4-8-rgb_front just like giraffes and tiger cubs and puppies and kittens trees grow up
1q1bxwgurra_5-8-rgb_front here is a good example of the wrong plant in the wrong place
1q1bxwgurra_6-8-rgb_front we have a wood planter box here filled with beautiful begonias and crotans and geraniums and then we have a little problem right here
1q1bxwgurra_7-8-rgb_front here is royal palm that looked good when it went in as a pot but tree is going to grow up to be a street size tree
1q1bxwgurra_8-8-rgb_front this will be easily or feet tall
1q1bxwgurra_9-8-rgb_front it will demolish this planter box
1q2bytlbdie_0-8-rgb_front hello
1q2bytlbdie_1-8-rgb_front i am sifu mallon with the clearwater kung fu center
1q2bytlbdie_10-8-rgb_front again so goes one two three
1q2bytlbdie_11-8-rgb_front the side step is to get your body off center
1q2bytlbdie_12-8-rgb_front so that means if i am stepping right here i step here and my body still stays here
1q2bytlbdie_13-8-rgb_front that means that the attacker can still hit me
1q2bytlbdie_14-8-rgb_front so i want a side step and move my body
1q2bytlbdie_15-8-rgb_front the block one two side step move the body
1q2bytlbdie_16-8-rgb_front o k
1q2bytlbdie_17-8-rgb_front so melissa you are facing me right
1q2bytlbdie_18-8-rgb_front and i am the attacker
1q2bytlbdie_19-8-rgb_front so i am going to throw i am going to throw my right hand
1q2bytlbdie_2-8-rgb_front this is my assistant melissa
1q2bytlbdie_20-8-rgb_front melissa is going to come up with her right hand going outside block one
1q2bytlbdie_21-8-rgb_front o k
1q2bytlbdie_22-8-rgb_front now out here and now left hand here
1q2bytlbdie_23-8-rgb_front so these two movements are simultaneous
1q2bytlbdie_24-8-rgb_front now she is going to step forward her left foot
1q2bytlbdie_25-8-rgb_front and lunge and push me off to the side
1q2bytlbdie_26-8-rgb_front that is it
1q2bytlbdie_27-8-rgb_front the idea with this block is to use your opponent is energy
1q2bytlbdie_28-8-rgb_front meaning that as i am coming this way right
1q2bytlbdie_29-8-rgb_front and you are doing one and two three and push
1q2bytlbdie_3-8-rgb_front and this is women is self defense tactics
1q2bytlbdie_30-8-rgb_front you are using my energy to push me past you
1q2bytlbdie_31-8-rgb_front again that is it
1q2bytlbdie_32-8-rgb_front this is double outside block women is self defense
1q2bytlbdie_4-8-rgb_front this one that we are working right now is called our double outside block
1q2bytlbdie_5-8-rgb_front to practice one you stand with your feet shoulder width apart
1q2bytlbdie_6-8-rgb_front you are going to bring your right hand blocking outside block
1q2bytlbdie_7-8-rgb_front your left hand comes behind it or actually in front of it palm block
1q2bytlbdie_8-8-rgb_front you are going to side step to the side with your left foot
1q2bytlbdie_9-8-rgb_front and then you are going to push to your right
1q7oqwl6qaq_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to have some fun talking about some types of things collectibles mostly that that you can still buy that are sleepers that are imports
1q7oqwl6qaq_10-8-rgb_front japan has different date lines and we are going to start covering those
1q7oqwl6qaq_11-8-rgb_front what you should look for and how to identify the japan date lines in terms of the names on the bottom of the cups and how they are made
1q7oqwl6qaq_12-8-rgb_front so japan occupied japan which one is it
1q7oqwl6qaq_13-8-rgb_front should i buy it
1q7oqwl6qaq_14-8-rgb_front maybe not but we will find out today on our segment about imports
1q7oqwl6qaq_2-8-rgb_front these imports are going to be really exciting but before i talk about those let me talk about me for a minute
1q7oqwl6qaq_3-8-rgb_front let s make it about me
1q7oqwl6qaq_4-8-rgb_front like i said my name is jan and i have an antique store in pomona it is called antique avenue
1q7oqwl6qaq_5-8-rgb_front i used to be a college administrator but i hated it boring so i decided to become an antique appraiser which is a heck of a lot more fun and it is more relevant if you ask me
1q7oqwl6qaq_6-8-rgb_front so i decided to be an antique appraiser and i opened my shop in pomona and so you can come anytime
1q7oqwl6qaq_7-8-rgb_front bring your trash or treasure and we will take a look at it for you
1q7oqwl6qaq_8-8-rgb_front so that is my expertise trash and treasure very exciting
1q7oqwl6qaq_9-8-rgb_front so today like i said we are going to be talking about imports and we are going to focus on japan
1qbezkhsxd4_0-8-rgb_front although you may compete in some triathlons especially in the spring that have pool swims a true triathlon takes an open water swim
1qbezkhsxd4_1-8-rgb_front and there are some special considerations when competing in an open water swim
1qbezkhsxd4_10-8-rgb_front the poorer swimmer you are the more you will gain time with the wet suit
1qbezkhsxd4_11-8-rgb_front if you have really good body position already the wet suit will not pick up a lot of time but most people will see a three to five second per hundred improvement and that is a really nice thing
1qbezkhsxd4_12-8-rgb_front another nice thing of course is that you are going to be able to wear what you are going to run and bike in underneath the wet suit and then just peel it off and be ready to go
1qbezkhsxd4_13-8-rgb_front so even though you are going to lose a bit of time taking a wet suit off you gain it by having that gear on underneath
1qbezkhsxd4_14-8-rgb_front some other specifics when you think about open water swimming is you need to get used to starting fast
1qbezkhsxd4_15-8-rgb_front it is real easy to get lulled into the group your with
1qbezkhsxd4_16-8-rgb_front so you want to get off the line quick and you could practice that in swimming by doing some fast fifties right before you do your long sets or something like that to get out and then quickly settle into your rhythm
1qbezkhsxd4_17_18-8-rgb_front you do not want to just kind of ease into the thing you get into a slow group if you have the opportunity to go to a lake to swim with a little triathlon club or something like that to practice open water swimming it is a great thing to do
1qbezkhsxd4_19-8-rgb_front you could practice drafting off somebody what it is like to swim right close behind and again that is just best experienced by doing it
1qbezkhsxd4_2-8-rgb_front some of them you can address in training and some of them really just need to be addressed by the experience of doing the races
1qbezkhsxd4_20-8-rgb_front some other things you can practice in the pool sighting
1qbezkhsxd4_21-8-rgb_front in an open water swim every six or eight strokes you need to chop the stroke short and stick your head up
1qbezkhsxd4_22-8-rgb_front staying on course is a whole other aspect of open water swimming
1qbezkhsxd4_23-8-rgb_front so try to pick something on the shore line not the buoy that you are swimming for but a boat ramp or a home or lamp pole or something so that if you have got a sea of bright orange caps in front of you that you still know what you are swimming for
1qbezkhsxd4_24-8-rgb_front so those are some real key and specific things for when you tackle that open water swim
1qbezkhsxd4_3-8-rgb_front one of the most basic tips put on your goggles then put the cap on over top of the goggles and that way if you collide with somebody and their hand drags along your head it will not rip your goggles off
1qbezkhsxd4_4-8-rgb_front you need to practice swimming in your wet suit
1qbezkhsxd4_5-8-rgb_front swimming in a wet suit is completely different than swimming without one
1qbezkhsxd4_6-8-rgb_front you will probably use one to two strokes less per length you will glide more and you will ride higher in the water
1qbezkhsxd4_7-8-rgb_front so you can take it into the pool and swim a bit in it just to get accustomed to it
1qbezkhsxd4_8-8-rgb_front it feels very different
1qbezkhsxd4_9-8-rgb_front it is very efficient
1qeugagkxjg_0-5-rgb_front maybe you went down to your specialty tea store and you bought a green and a black and maybe you bought a rooibos or a white tea
1qeugagkxjg_1-5-rgb_front maybe you bought a whole bunch of different kinds because you wanted to try them all
1qeugagkxjg_2-5-rgb_front you are going to need a way to store that tea
1qeugagkxjg_3-5-rgb_front now generally when you buy tea it is going to come in either a metal canister or an opaque zipper sealed plastic bag
1qeugagkxjg_4-5-rgb_front those are great things to store your tea in
1qeugagkxjg_5-5-rgb_front i can also recommend that if maybe you bought your tea in bulk from the grocery store or something like that you put it in something that is air tight
1qeugagkxjg_6-5-rgb_front it might be a container like this or even a plastic bag
1qeugagkxjg_7-5-rgb_front and light could have harmful effects on you tea
1qeugagkxjg_8-5-rgb_front if you do store it in a clear plastic bag it is great because it is air tight but you might want to store it inside a cupboard or cabinet someplace where the light is not going to get to it
1qihg8xlxhg_0-5-rgb_front okay the toss the purpose of the toss is to get the ball in good position so you can hit the serve
1qihg8xlxhg_1-5-rgb_front so if i toss the ball way over my head i am not going to be able to hit that serve very comfortably
1qihg8xlxhg_10-5-rgb_front you can go and get a little basket or whatever
1qihg8xlxhg_11-5-rgb_front but what i want people to do you just take a ball and you just toss it through the hoop which is not as easy as it looks even for somebody that has practiced as much as me
1qihg8xlxhg_12-5-rgb_front it still is not that easy
1qihg8xlxhg_13-5-rgb_front so you want to just practice like that or you can come out here and just try to make a basket
1qihg8xlxhg_14-5-rgb_front so if you do this your toss will improve dramatically
1qihg8xlxhg_15-5-rgb_front there is a lot more technical issues with the toss but if you just start with learning to toss it up into a target you will be amazed at how quickly your toss improves and your serve
1qihg8xlxhg_2-5-rgb_front so you want to learn to toss it right up there so you can hit the ball consistently
1qihg8xlxhg_3-5-rgb_front take any other sport if you watch golfers they are going to line the ball up where they can hit it
1qihg8xlxhg_4-5-rgb_front so in tennis you want to get the toss right where you can hit it comfortably for the serve that you want to hit
1qihg8xlxhg_5-5-rgb_front now the toss looks pretty easy to the casual player which is why nobody ever practices it
1qihg8xlxhg_6-5-rgb_front but if you practice your toss just a little bit your toss will improve and when your toss improves guess what
1qihg8xlxhg_7-5-rgb_front your serve improves because it is a lot easier to hit the ball right there every time than it is one time over there one time over there
1qihg8xlxhg_8-5-rgb_front so what i have done is i have rigged up a little practice device on the fence here
1qihg8xlxhg_9-5-rgb_front this is just a hanger
1qjtpze0f3k_0-8-rgb_front i am dr joe neely i practice with the barton oaks dental group
1qjtpze0f3k_1-8-rgb_front i am going to talk about the history of the toothbrush
1qjtpze0f3k_10-8-rgb_front so truthfully the smaller the toothbrush usually the better
1qjtpze0f3k_2_3-8-rgb_front need is definitely necessity is the mother of invention i believe is how that goes and the toothbrush basically started as a stick that had been chewed on and the end of the stick became softened and somewhat frayed
1qjtpze0f3k_4-8-rgb_front and the stick was used to basically go across and scrape your teeth
1qjtpze0f3k_5-8-rgb_front early on there was also the use of bone there are actually bone things that had been found by archaeologist that look to resemble toothpicks
1qjtpze0f3k_6-8-rgb_front because of the essence stuck in between your teeth you need something slender to slide in there and push it out
1qjtpze0f3k_7-8-rgb_front over time like any cleaning aid people who were merchants found new ways to make them more efficient
1qjtpze0f3k_8-8-rgb_front or in the case of most modern toothbrushes more elaborate and interesting looking so that you can sell them
1qjtpze0f3k_9-8-rgb_front but basically all a toothbrush is is a cleaning tool that is of the appropriate size and shape to clean the object that you are trying to clean
1qqov46mmvo_1-5-rgb_front i will be your therapist for today
1qqov46mmvo_2-5-rgb_front i have been doing massage for about eight years now and i studied at englewood school of massage in new jersey and i have a license in new york new jersey california and atlanta
1qqov46mmvo_3-5-rgb_front currently i work here in venice at paypony nail and day spa lincoln boulevard
1qqov46mmvo_4-5-rgb_front today we are going to focus on carpal tunnel and anything that has to do with any tension in your forearms okay
1qqov46mmvo_5-5-rgb_front so usually carpal tunnel is attributed to typing anything that has to do with continuous use of the wrist a number of things you could have injured your wrist fall on your wrist and never quite rehabbed it properly
1qqov46mmvo_6-5-rgb_front so what we are going to do is we are going to try to relieve any type of tension
1qqov46mmvo_7-5-rgb_front we are going to do the stretching and we are going to do everything that we can to make you feel much better in your wrist and joints around your hand and forearm
1qt8l93llx8_0-5-rgb_front maad is mission is to stop drunk driving support the victims of this violent crime and to prevent underage drinking
1qt8l93llx8_1-5-rgb_front that is a very comprehensive mission but it is also very focused at the same time
1qt8l93llx8_10-5-rgb_front that is though working with legislation that is through working with education that is with working with judicial system and law enforcement
1qt8l93llx8_11-5-rgb_front those are our four kind of main pillars that we have got
1qt8l93llx8_12-5-rgb_front and we are making a huge impact
1qt8l93llx8_13-5-rgb_front you can see across the united states that it is visible and we are out there trying to make a difference and save lives
1qt8l93llx8_2-5-rgb_front we go in and we work with law enforcement we work with families we work with hospitals
1qt8l93llx8_3-5-rgb_front we work with all kinds of other service organizations to go in and try and stop drunk driving
1qt8l93llx8_4-5-rgb_front we go in with the prevention part of it underage drinking too
1qt8l93llx8_5-5-rgb_front the earlier studies show the earlier that youth actually consume alcohol which on average now is about twelve years old the more likely they are to have a dependency problem or to have drunk driving in their future
1qt8l93llx8_6-5-rgb_front so we try and go in and get to the root of the problem
1qt8l93llx8_7-5-rgb_front we start with our programs in early youth and we continue those throughout outreach throughout the community throughout the entire year
1qt8l93llx8_8-5-rgb_front to try and make sure we are accomplishing our goals
1qt8l93llx8_9-5-rgb_front maad on a national level since we began in we are saying our estimates show that we have been able to save lives
1qcvn72jzlw_0-5-rgb_front what i am doing here is i am just kind of finishing up shaping my little orchid here
1qcvn72jzlw_1-5-rgb_front what i am going to do is take these leaves and i think i am going to fold them over one more time down here
1qcvn72jzlw_2-5-rgb_front just a little bit more
1qcvn72jzlw_3-5-rgb_front then i am going to take them in my chopstick just really put a real good twist on them
1qcvn72jzlw_4-5-rgb_front cause when you see the plant they have the leaves here and they twist as with age
1qcvn72jzlw_5-5-rgb_front they just kind of twist and hang down and you can just manually grab it and twist it by hand if you want to
1qcvn72jzlw_6-5-rgb_front just what ever it takes to give it the plant look that it really deserves
1qcvn72jzlw_7-5-rgb_front give it a little bit here a little more here a little fold here
1qcvn72jzlw_8-5-rgb_front just grab it and just twist it all along up here
1qcvn72jzlw_9-5-rgb_front just work with it a little bit and this how your golden slipper plant should look of course i am going to work with it a little bit more to get it to looking right but essentially this is how you do it
1qemnh_daqo_0-5-rgb_front i also sculpt in wood
1qemnh_daqo_1-5-rgb_front and wood is probably one of the oldest forms of sculpture
1qemnh_daqo_10-5-rgb_front in the northwest area of the united states here the people do totem poles
1qemnh_daqo_11-5-rgb_front the do different totems in other countries also that represent families
1qemnh_daqo_2-5-rgb_front i mean it does not if the civilization were to die and the wood ends up on the ground you are not going to find it
1qemnh_daqo_26-5-rgb_front and now that i have the log i am going to take my sketch book and put down what i think i want to create with this piece
1qemnh_daqo_27-5-rgb_front so i get my sketch book open it up
1qemnh_daqo_28-5-rgb_front i was inspired by my wife is father who was a war hero
1qemnh_daqo_29-5-rgb_front and when he passed away i decided i was going to do a war memorial piece
1qemnh_daqo_30-5-rgb_front and i am going to name it eternal hero
1qemnh_daqo_31-5-rgb_front all is basically is is this i am going to follow the line of the sculpture
1qemnh_daqo_32-5-rgb_front i am going to follow the line of the log or the tree
1qemnh_daqo_33-5-rgb_front and my sketches are very simple
1qemnh_daqo_34-5-rgb_front i want the arms to come up like this
1qemnh_daqo_35-5-rgb_front i do very simple sketches
1qemnh_daqo_36-5-rgb_front and it is not uncommon for me to use a lot of little squirrels to get the shape of the body
1qemnh_daqo_37-5-rgb_front and i want the legs to go down like this
1qemnh_daqo_38-5-rgb_front and then he is going to have a medal of honor up here
1qemnh_daqo_39-5-rgb_front to bring the energy to the piece i will put gold leaf on the faces gold leaf on the faces and on the hands and on the medal
1qemnh_daqo_3_4-5-rgb_front there are very primitive wood sculptures that are found i mean my work actually i consider kind of primitive because i do not know i drew a lot of my concepts from ester island
1qemnh_daqo_40-5-rgb_front and the piece will be painted to make it look like bronze
1qemnh_daqo_5-5-rgb_front i love these tall slender pieces that i do
1qemnh_daqo_6-5-rgb_front and the question is how to preserve it
1qemnh_daqo_7-5-rgb_front today we have much better ways of preserving it
1qemnh_daqo_8-5-rgb_front and i love working with wood also because it is just so organic
1qemnh_daqo_9-5-rgb_front and today i am going to demonstrate how i sculpt in wood
1qz0sixs3no_0-5-rgb_front hi i am lisa goldsworthy with ace carpet and upholstery care in denver colorado
1qz0sixs3no_1-5-rgb_front and in this segment we are going to talk about what you should do when you have a spill on your carpet
1qz0sixs3no_10-5-rgb_front i am getting a lot of liquid out
1qz0sixs3no_11-5-rgb_front continue to blot until the area is dry
1qz0sixs3no_12-5-rgb_front now you will find with any spill especially one of that magnitude that was quite a bit of liquid that went in there it goes through the bottom
1qz0sixs3no_13-5-rgb_front in this particular case i feel that it is wet however we do not see the color in here
1qz0sixs3no_14-5-rgb_front but it is wet
1qz0sixs3no_15-5-rgb_front so you just want to blot
1qz0sixs3no_16-5-rgb_front and already already this carpet sample pretty dry to the touch
1qz0sixs3no_17-5-rgb_front again the scotchgard helped us but even a carpet without the scotchgard if your carpet is older its okay
1qz0sixs3no_18-5-rgb_front just this blotting technique really does a lot
1qz0sixs3no_19-5-rgb_front so that s really the most important thing you can do in a spill is take a white towel and blot it
1qz0sixs3no_2-5-rgb_front take immediate action got the spill take immediate action
1qz0sixs3no_20-5-rgb_front and be patient
1qz0sixs3no_21-5-rgb_front you want it dry as soon as possible
1qz0sixs3no_22-5-rgb_front so the other thing i would highly recommend is to take a fan and just put it on the area and let it dry
1qz0sixs3no_23_24_25-5-rgb_front now look its kind of matted down a little bit from my blotting right so just take it bring that carpet nap up
1qz0sixs3no_26-5-rgb_front bring it back up
1qz0sixs3no_27-5-rgb_front and the reason why you want to do that is because then the air flow can get in through this carpet and that you decrease that drying time
1qz0sixs3no_28-5-rgb_front you want to get that carpet as dry as possible as quickly as possible
1qz0sixs3no_29-5-rgb_front so good job
1qz0sixs3no_3-5-rgb_front first thing is to take a white towel white cotton tile and blot
1qz0sixs3no_4-5-rgb_front never scrub never ever scrub
1qz0sixs3no_5-5-rgb_front look what i got just from that blotting right there
1qz0sixs3no_6-5-rgb_front and just be patient and blot
1qz0sixs3no_7-5-rgb_front put some muscle in to it
1qz0sixs3no_8-5-rgb_front just continue your blotting
1qz0sixs3no_9-5-rgb_front okay
1rexebjzhbs_0-5-rgb_front okay how to identify cardiac arrest
1rexebjzhbs_1-5-rgb_front as we discussed earlier cardiac arrest is a loss of responsiveness absence of breathing and the absence of pulse
1rexebjzhbs_10-5-rgb_front you have already started the first two steps
1rexebjzhbs_11-5-rgb_front first you have early recognition
1rexebjzhbs_12-5-rgb_front second you start early cpr
1rexebjzhbs_13-5-rgb_front next you need to activate the system and summon help and then advance life support treatment can be initiated on this patient
1rexebjzhbs_2-5-rgb_front to do that if you find a person laying on the ground or sitting in their chair that appears to be asleep see if they can wake up
1rexebjzhbs_3-5-rgb_front you can do that by shaking them or shouting at them
1rexebjzhbs_4-5-rgb_front if they do not respond check to see if they are breathing and look listen and feel is usually what is taught in cpr classes
1rexebjzhbs_5-5-rgb_front check for a pulse
1rexebjzhbs_6-5-rgb_front you can check a pulse either on the radial pulse or at your carotid
1rexebjzhbs_7-5-rgb_front if you do not feel a pulse if they are unresponsive and not breathing then they are in cardiac arrest
1rexebjzhbs_8-5-rgb_front when you have identified somebody that is in cardiac arrest cpr needs to be started immediately
1rexebjzhbs_9-5-rgb_front the basic chain of survival needs to be followed
1rkboiqngxo_0-5-rgb_front this potential neck opening is not someone with a napkin tied around their neck in order to eat dinner
1rkboiqngxo_1-5-rgb_front she is not going to eat any barbecue anytime soon
1rkboiqngxo_10-5-rgb_front that is why it looks kind of like a napkin around your neck
1rkboiqngxo_11-5-rgb_front but the knots right there are created by bunching a wider width of fabric into a smaller width and then you have your knots
1rkboiqngxo_2-5-rgb_front but this is an opening that has knotted shoulders
1rkboiqngxo_3-5-rgb_front the point of this is to create variation in your styles
1rkboiqngxo_4-5-rgb_front you can flip it and have the knots at the bottom if you wanted to
1rkboiqngxo_5-5-rgb_front what the knotted shoulders show you is that there is two the knots can either be faux knots that are placed there and then have it sewn closed or you could actually have the garment go on kind of i guess kind of like a diaper
1rkboiqngxo_6-5-rgb_front but a top
1rkboiqngxo_7-5-rgb_front and there is your front piece is one piece and then your back piece is another piece
1rkboiqngxo_8-5-rgb_front and they come up over the shoulders and tie together
1rkboiqngxo_9-5-rgb_front that is how the garment stays on
1rkg0ffw0to_0-5-rgb_front hi i am les whitley and i would like to take a few moments right now and tell you how to train for the shot put
1rkg0ffw0to_1-5-rgb_front the shot put is a very popular olympic event which requires a lot of power and force to overcome the weight and gravity of an object such as the shot put itself
1rkg0ffw0to_10-5-rgb_front physics in overcoming gravity and utilizing your body to propel an object through space at an appropriate angle where the geometry comes into it
1rkg0ffw0to_11-5-rgb_front ideally between not quite a not quite flat out but somewhere around a degree angle to get the shot put to travel at an appropriate distance to cover maximal ground
1rkg0ffw0to_12-5-rgb_front next becomes position whether you utilize the glide technique where your body is actually traveling through a straight line as you approach the ring body moving back the shot put is placed back you are balancing off of one leg
1rkg0ffw0to_13-5-rgb_front you are actually traveling in a linear position pushing your body back rotating through extending the body and pushing through that arc maintaining that degree angle as the shot put leaves
1rkg0ffw0to_14-5-rgb_front the other is the rotational spin where if you had imagined the circle being here the body goes into a power position you actually spin through block through and accelerate the shot put through
1rkg0ffw0to_15-5-rgb_front the basic technique involves tucking under the chin the arm accelerates through the body rotates through using the leg drive rotational force of the body
1rkg0ffw0to_16-5-rgb_front block with the arm to cause the opposite side to push through as you drive the object of the shot put through space
1rkg0ffw0to_2-5-rgb_front that requires a lot of explosive power that is developed through strength training strength training utilizing the lower body as well as the upper body exercises such as the squat the overhead press or olympic movements such as the clean and jerk or the olympic snatch
1rkg0ffw0to_3-5-rgb_front the goal there is to move an object through space as quickly as possible
1rkg0ffw0to_4-5-rgb_front the olympic movements are exactly that and train the body to recruit maximal power for a very short period of time to cover a lot of ground in moving weights through space
1rkg0ffw0to_5-5-rgb_front the next thing becomes technique
1rkg0ffw0to_6-5-rgb_front you can be extremely strong and have poor technique and be a pretty decent shot putter
1rkg0ffw0to_7-5-rgb_front you can have great technique and not be very strong and your shot put is not going to go as far
1rkg0ffw0to_8-5-rgb_front so it is important to have a good balance of technique as well as strength
1rkg0ffw0to_9-5-rgb_front the shot put involves basic aspects of geometry and physics
1rkltss46fg_1-5-rgb_front next we come to shoes
1rkltss46fg_13-5-rgb_front also again you do not want too loose kind of like the worker solid sturdy look of your shoe that you are going to be wearing as a scarecrow
1rkltss46fg_14-5-rgb_front some scarecrows do not have shoes as i have already said
1rkltss46fg_15-5-rgb_front but of course you are not going to be walking around barefoot
1rkltss46fg_16-5-rgb_front that would look a little bit funny
1rkltss46fg_17-5-rgb_front and also you are going to want a shoe which has a higher top to it
1rkltss46fg_18-5-rgb_front why is that
1rkltss46fg_19-5-rgb_front low top shoes we are going to have some stuff coming out of the bottom of the pant leg that we are going to go into later
1rkltss46fg_2-5-rgb_front you are going to want a good sturdy shoe
1rkltss46fg_20-5-rgb_front you are going to want a high top to kind of catch that to help hold it
1rkltss46fg_21-5-rgb_front you are also going to want to make sure that your ankle has a lot of stability and support because you do not want to turn it just because your legs a little bit more rumpled than normal
1rkltss46fg_3-5-rgb_front i mean this should be a shoe for a scarecrow
1rkltss46fg_4-5-rgb_front it is a shoe you would go hiking in
1rkltss46fg_5-5-rgb_front it is the shoe you would scale a mountain in
1rkltss46fg_6-5-rgb_front okay maybe not quite that extreme but close
1rkltss46fg_7-5-rgb_front you definitely want an out doorsy strong shoe
1rkltss46fg_8-5-rgb_front colors of shoe that i prefer for a scarecrow are of course brown
1rkltss46fg_9_10_11_12-5-rgb_front i mean you want colors warmer colors of the soil colors of the harvest even having some of lighter beige colors in there also could work
1rko1xjauj4_0-5-rgb_front hi this is david duke
1rko1xjauj4_10-5-rgb_front so it is really not much weight on my shoulders
1rko1xjauj4_11-5-rgb_front these hands here are used to control my nose angle so i can actually steer the glider as it is flying right here even just as i would in the sky
1rko1xjauj4_12-5-rgb_front we can check that we are hooked one more time
1rko1xjauj4_13-5-rgb_front again i am noticing that i am not in my backup but we are not going to do that today
1rko1xjauj4_14-5-rgb_front so then i want to use the wind to actually help me walk back up this little training slope we have here
1rko1xjauj4_2-5-rgb_front in this clip i am going to talk about carrying the glider
1rko1xjauj4_3-5-rgb_front i have it balanced on my shoulders about at the edge of the deltoid right here
1rko1xjauj4_4-5-rgb_front each wing is about the size of a hobicat sail so you can imagine the power that wings can generate if you get them into the wind wrong
1rko1xjauj4_5-5-rgb_front so this is the correct way to pick it up turn it around
1rko1xjauj4_6-5-rgb_front and your instructor will go over all of this
1rko1xjauj4_7-5-rgb_front do not get your nose too high or you will go over backwards
1rko1xjauj4_8-5-rgb_front and now we are into the wind
1rko1xjauj4_9-5-rgb_front and the glider is actually in this wind it is pretty much flying right now
1rkv7hjtf80_0-5-rgb_front hi welcome back

1rkv7hjtf80_5-5-rgb_front now color is on a color level through brown being a or
1rkv7hjtf80_6-5-rgb_front now if you want to achieve a rich brown stay on your level something in a or a
1rkv7hjtf80_7-5-rgb_front if you have a light skin tone you might want to go with a lighter brown
1rkv7hjtf80_8-5-rgb_front if you have a medium skin tone you might want to go with like an auburn brown to add some richness
1rkv7hjtf80_9-5-rgb_front if you have a dark skin tone like myself you might want to go for a very very rich brown
1rq3dfbcjmi_0-5-rgb_front alright we have been talking about what it is that you are good at what jobs are out there what is available
1rq3dfbcjmi_1-5-rgb_front but now you have to take a look at what do you want to do
1rq3dfbcjmi_10-5-rgb_front do you want to work in a place where you can wear jeans and a
1rq3dfbcjmi_11-5-rgb_front do you want to work outside
1rq3dfbcjmi_12-5-rgb_front do you want to work nights
1rq3dfbcjmi_13-5-rgb_front what would make you happy
1rq3dfbcjmi_14-5-rgb_front know what would make you happy before you start sending out resumes to a job that will not
1rq3dfbcjmi_2-5-rgb_front and that may conflict with what you are good at that may conflict with what jobs are available
1rq3dfbcjmi_3-5-rgb_front but it is very important that you know what it is you want to do
1rq3dfbcjmi_4-5-rgb_front what are your values and how will your work enhance those values
1rq3dfbcjmi_5-5-rgb_front what do you want to do on a day to day basis that will bring you joy and satisfaction
1rq3dfbcjmi_6-5-rgb_front now i know sometimes you know you just you have to make money
1rq3dfbcjmi_7-5-rgb_front but in the long term picture of things you never want to get locked into a job where you are going to be miserable
1rq3dfbcjmi_8-5-rgb_front we spend so much time at work
1rq3dfbcjmi_9-5-rgb_front so what is it that you want to do
1rggcj0hw6k_0-5-rgb_front cindy mastry once you have mastered the revolved triangle pose you can take this pose to a little bit deeper level by placing the block on the outside of the foot rather the inside of the foot
1rggcj0hw6k_1-5-rgb_front faith is going to help me demonstrate that now
1rggcj0hw6k_10-5-rgb_front again she is going to rotate her shoulder and her hip open
1rggcj0hw6k_11-5-rgb_front good
1rggcj0hw6k_12-5-rgb_front keeping the hips square
1rggcj0hw6k_13-5-rgb_front and then when she is ready she can extend her arm up to the sky
1rggcj0hw6k_14-5-rgb_front good
1rggcj0hw6k_15-5-rgb_front pressing down into the block and reaching up through her finger tips
1rggcj0hw6k_16-5-rgb_front she wants to reach the crown of her head forward and then allow her face to rotate
1rggcj0hw6k_17-5-rgb_front you can look up to the hand but if that gives you a little more of a balance problem then you can just look forward or down
1rggcj0hw6k_18-5-rgb_front you want to have your neck comfortable and you want to be able to hold this pose in a position where you can inhale and breathe your spine long and exhale sink into the pose allowing your hips allowing your low spine and your pelvis to open allowing your heart to open and your chest to open
1rggcj0hw6k_2-5-rgb_front so she is going to find her long spine
1rggcj0hw6k_3-5-rgb_front it is always important to find your long spine first
1rggcj0hw6k_4_5_6-5-rgb_front and she is going to step her foot forward just a couple of feet forward not too far good and she is going to take her left hand to her left hip
1rggcj0hw6k_7-5-rgb_front she is going to extend up through her right hand and lengthen out through her torso
1rggcj0hw6k_8-5-rgb_front as she exhales she reaches out and forward keeping the length through both side bodies and then she is going to bring that block down to the pinkie toe side of her foot
1rggcj0hw6k_9-5-rgb_front a little bit more twist is involved a little bit more massage for your abdominal muscles
1rk3pc7_mmq_7-5-rgb_front so let is put it into our boiling water and then we are going to let it boil for about minutes before checking it
1rk3pc7_mmq_8-5-rgb_front because it is not super super dried it does not need nearly as much time as box pasta does so we are just going to leave it in here stir frequently and check in about minutes
1rk3pc7_mmq_9-5-rgb_front once the pasta is cooked it is going to have swelled up just a little bit almost like a dumpling you are going to drain it and then it s ready for you to choose a sauce
1rvusobtofk_0-5-rgb_front john r junger watercolor painting is aptly name because it is an amalgam of water and color and let is see what we could do with it
1rvusobtofk_1-5-rgb_front if i took a brush and wet it open my paints and just look what i am doing
1rvusobtofk_2-5-rgb_front now you see this
1rvusobtofk_3-5-rgb_front this is scrap paper
1rvusobtofk_4-5-rgb_front i always test what i am doing on scrap paper
1rvusobtofk_5-5-rgb_front now this is called a flat wash because when it dries it is going to be one flat color from beginning to end
1rvusobtofk_6_7_8-5-rgb_front now a lot of people use that because it is very nice now again you notice i test my color this is called the graded wash now it looks just like a flat wash but what i could do is take another color if i wish and grade it into that
1rvusobtofk_9-5-rgb_front so that is no longer flat wash but it becomes a graded wash
1rvc-tbubj0_0-5-rgb_front mark blocker okay in this segment i am going to cover installing the brake pads
1rvc-tbubj0_1-5-rgb_front what i have done is i have laid out the four brake pads that come in a brake pad replacement kit
1rvc-tbubj0_10-5-rgb_front we have to install the silencers that came on the used ones i am transferring on to the new ones because it did not come equip with those
1rvc-tbubj0_11-5-rgb_front and you remember there is two distinctively different style silencers used
1rvc-tbubj0_12-5-rgb_front the outboard pad had the wide fingers of the outer side of caliper for sealing so i used the wide finger
1rvc-tbubj0_13-5-rgb_front do you to see where it is sealed on before that is the outboard pad that applies just to that
1rvc-tbubj0_14-5-rgb_front this is the inboard pad where the piston applies pressure against the brake pad and that is done in the center
1rvc-tbubj0_15-5-rgb_front now you want these tabs to be securely mounted the way to do so is you take a large pair of channel lock pliers and you just adjust them for comfortable grip across the pad and you just squeeze on
1rvc-tbubj0_16-5-rgb_front there is two tabs on one side one in the center just squeeze and lock those down all three tabs and that secures the brake silencer to the pad
1rvc-tbubj0_17-5-rgb_front and just as safe as you do again with the other brake pad and it is secure
1rvc-tbubj0_18-5-rgb_front now we can install the pads into the caliper mounting bracket
1rvc-tbubj0_19-5-rgb_front prior to doing so where the pads slide back and forth in the caliper assemblies we want to make sure and lubricate that area
1rvc-tbubj0_2-5-rgb_front you have got two pads for each side of the vehicle
1rvc-tbubj0_20-5-rgb_front we want to use a very small amount of lubricant because we do not want an excess to get on the pads or around in the brake system just adequate to lubricate the system
1rvc-tbubj0_21-5-rgb_front please watch our next segment and we will cover installing the pads part
1rvc-tbubj0_3-5-rgb_front as you have noticed there is the difference in two of the pads
1rvc-tbubj0_4-5-rgb_front two pads are identical
1rvc-tbubj0_5-5-rgb_front that is the outboard pad on each side and the two inboard pads are inverted so that the warning tab is located in correct position
1rvc-tbubj0_6-5-rgb_front so if you take the brake pads you just remove and match them up
1rvc-tbubj0_7-5-rgb_front these two matched
1rvc-tbubj0_8-5-rgb_front this is my inboard one
1rvc-tbubj0_9-5-rgb_front both outboard pads are identical for sides so just select one now i have my pads
1rxyvovkhku_0-5-rgb_front if you are interested in designing an exercise program specifically for yourself my advice is to take the advice of a personal trainer if you do not have those resources then think about what are the things that you really like to do
1rxyvovkhku_1-5-rgb_front if you do not like to run then do not set a running program up for yourself because you will set yourself up for failure
1rxyvovkhku_10-5-rgb_front those are the three variables that you need to think about along your exercise program that you can manipulate over time
1rxyvovkhku_11-5-rgb_front can you work out more times per week than when you started
1rxyvovkhku_12-5-rgb_front can you go longer in your duration
1rxyvovkhku_13-5-rgb_front can you increase the intensity
1rxyvovkhku_14-5-rgb_front if you try and stay with the same program for week after week or month after month your body is going to get used to it and say this is easy
1rxyvovkhku_15-5-rgb_front it started hard it is easy and it needs more of a challenge so to avoid those plateaus find some other exercises that you might like to do and incorporate those so maybe monday you will go for a walk tuesday you go for a swim wednesday you go for a bike ride etc
1rxyvovkhku_16-5-rgb_front you really need to incorporate something that is going to challenge your cardiovascular system which is the heart and lungs it is going to elevate the heart rate and also some resistance exercises using dumb bells or free weights
1rxyvovkhku_17-5-rgb_front you do not necessarily have to go to a gym but find something that you can do at home and make sure you are using proper form and techniques so that you avoid risk of injury along down the lines
1rxyvovkhku_18-5-rgb_front this is alice monsaert hoping that you can design a program for yourself to keep yourself healthy for the rest of your life
1rxyvovkhku_2-5-rgb_front simply find those activities that you really enjoy
1rxyvovkhku_3-5-rgb_front is it dancing
1rxyvovkhku_4-5-rgb_front is it swimming
1rxyvovkhku_5-5-rgb_front is it walking
1rxyvovkhku_6-5-rgb_front have you tried resistance training
1rxyvovkhku_7-5-rgb_front those are the things that you need to think about when you design a program
1rxyvovkhku_8-5-rgb_front you need to also think about how many days per week can i do this program
1rxyvovkhku_9-5-rgb_front how long can i spend doing the program and at what intensity level am i able to work out
1s-fjorjfpi_0-5-rgb_front my name is kim millikan and we are here at the adaptive climbing wall at the national ability center
1s-fjorjfpi_1-5-rgb_front if you would like to get into adaptive climbing there are many ways to do it
1s-fjorjfpi_2-5-rgb_front the first thing i would do is check with your doctor and see what kind of things you should be concerned with if you are going to be climbing
1s-fjorjfpi_3-5-rgb_front call an adaptive recreation center and they should have plenty of the equipment experience and knowledge
1s-fjorjfpi_4-5-rgb_front also a lot of recreation centers that are city and state and government managed are required to have ada personnel on staff and they may know something as well
1s-fjorjfpi_5-5-rgb_front that would be the first places i would go
1s-fjorjfpi_6-5-rgb_front if that did not occur i would go to a climbing gym and i would look for people i would look for people there who have had experience climbing with people with disabilities or who have knowledge in general
1s-fjorjfpi_7-5-rgb_front if you have a bad experience or you go to an adaptive center that i would trust my judgment and i would go somewhere else
1s-fjorjfpi_8-5-rgb_front i have been to climbing gyms in several countries where i felt safe and comfortable and i have also been to others where i did not and the truth is that if you have done your research and you have had a couple of good practices somewhere you will know if it is good or not and you will know to run away
1s-fjorjfpi_9-5-rgb_front if you go there and you do not immediately do not feel comfortable go somewhere else because your life is in the hands of your belayer and if you are bouldering you are going to have so much more success with somebody who understands climbing and understands how to work with it with people who have different abilities because
1s1jzjpjgp0_0-5-rgb_front well before we describe what fashion designing is we should know what fashion is
1s1jzjpjgp0_1-5-rgb_front over the year and since the fashion is just become an essential for our day to day life
1s1jzjpjgp0_2-5-rgb_front so we should concentrate on fashion by keeping in mind that we should follow the current trends in our day to day life
1s1jzjpjgp0_3-5-rgb_front now i will describe you the four components of fashion
1s1jzjpjgp0_4-5-rgb_front the very first part here comes is the silhouette which is very essential
1smnc4urvlo_0-5-rgb_front hi i am back and so is a cupful of my urine
1smnc4urvlo_1-5-rgb_front i have produced approximately ml of urine sample ml is the limit
1smnc4urvlo_10-5-rgb_front you are not going to want to contaminate these with urine nor are you going to want to touch any of this with your bare hand
1smnc4urvlo_11-5-rgb_front it can possibly introduce agents skin oils or other contaminants that can skew your test results
1smnc4urvlo_12-5-rgb_front it is going to stay in for approximately minutes and then we have approximately a minute window to read it
1smnc4urvlo_13-5-rgb_front so let is go ahead and dip it in and check
1smnc4urvlo_14-5-rgb_front we are going to come back in minutes and take a look at any sort of intoxicants or other drugs that may or most likely may not be in my urine
1smnc4urvlo_2-5-rgb_front as you can see one of the dots is so warm that it has gone blue which is going to be a detection past green
1smnc4urvlo_3-5-rgb_front i assure you with of my heart soul and being that this is a freshly produced unadulterated urine sample of my own creation
1smnc4urvlo_4-5-rgb_front so now we are going to crack open the test strip and we are going to execute our test
1smnc4urvlo_5-5-rgb_front now this is a timed test so it is important that you have a watch clock or other timing device available
1smnc4urvlo_6-5-rgb_front i showed the test strip to you earlier but i will show it to you again
1smnc4urvlo_7-5-rgb_front what we are going to do is simply place this in the cup up to the max urine level
1smnc4urvlo_8-5-rgb_front so this is going to be the minimum line here and the max line is here
1smnc4urvlo_9-5-rgb_front these are your result strips
1spq72xcq6u_1-5-rgb_front haunted houses are all about what is going on where
1spq72xcq6u_2-5-rgb_front it suppose to be a house and houses have different rooms or compartments to them
1spq72xcq6u_3-5-rgb_front so different compartments will have different themes as your mapping out your house try to think about different themes or settings that you like to have in your house
1spq72xcq6u_4-5-rgb_front some popular scenes i have heard is having a crazy clown room a graveyard a demons layer a laborant for example
1spq72xcq6u_5-5-rgb_front you can also consider if you have more four or five compartments having a slightly lighter room a fun room
1spq72xcq6u_6-5-rgb_front this is okay it can still be a little creepy and a little bit of fun and not every single room in your haunted house has to be super freaky
1spq72xcq6u_7-5-rgb_front for example you can have a room that you can have a dancing ghoul usually this is somebody who is seated as the people enter the room some music starts up the ghoul starts dancing a little bit
1spq72xcq6u_8-5-rgb_front it is a nice little enter mixing of fun if you really want to play on psychological reactions having a little fun and humor a little bit not too much
1spq72xcq6u_9-5-rgb_front is actually good to have between frights so they do not become descentized
1skwaa61esq_0-5-rgb_front okay the next step that we are going to do is we have used the different parts of the nebulizer and we are going to do a cleaning
1skwaa61esq_1-5-rgb_front you need to do this between every time that you use a nebulizer
1skwaa61esq_10-5-rgb_front you do not necessarily have to soak them for any great deal you are just going to be rinsing them just good so that they are getting a nice cleaning with the soapy water
1skwaa61esq_2-5-rgb_front so i know sometimes with my children it would be a couple of times a day
1skwaa61esq_3-5-rgb_front you want to take it apart first by disengaging the hose from the other components of the nebulizer
1skwaa61esq_4-5-rgb_front again as i mentioned earlier do not wash the hose do not do anything with it you do not ever want to get any kind of water in here because that could if it does not dry properly it could lead to an infection so you definitely do not want to do anything with the hose
1skwaa61esq_5-5-rgb_front only replace it when it starting to get worn or torn
1skwaa61esq_6-5-rgb_front the other parts what we are going to do is we are just going to take regular clean tap water
1skwaa61esq_7-5-rgb_front i have got some dish detergent that you use to wash your dishes with you want to use a non lemon
1skwaa61esq_8-5-rgb_front the lemon kind of detergent could be something that might weaken the materials that are getting washed the plastic
1skwaa61esq_9-5-rgb_front put them in there
1smcdi9u3sg_0-5-rgb_front we are going to do a version of cat cow
1smcdi9u3sg_1-5-rgb_front we are going to turn this into vinyasa
1smcdi9u3sg_2-5-rgb_front vinyasa flows with the breath so that movement follows the breath
1smcdi9u3sg_3-5-rgb_front with an inhale jennifer is going to slowly come into table so she only moves as long as the length of her inhale
1smcdi9u3sg_4-5-rgb_front the first inhale she is going to lift the tail bone inhale and lift the tail bone
1smcdi9u3sg_5-5-rgb_front she is going to draw the spine one vertebra at a time down to the earth at the end of her inhale the head will lift
1smcdi9u3sg_6-5-rgb_front she is going to keep her head lifted initiate the exhale from the tail bone she drops the tail bone rolls down one vertebra at a time chin to chest at the end of the exhale
1smcdi9u3sg_7-5-rgb_front again we initiate the inhale from the tip of the tail bone lift the tail bone up flow through the spine at the end of her inhale she will lift her head and maintain exhale drops the tail bone flow through the spine articulating every vertebra chin to chest continue to flow the length of your breath
1smcdi9u3sg_8-5-rgb_front you are always going to initiate the movement with the tip of the tail bone whether you are lifting or falling lifting and dropping the head movement follows breath enjoy
1sokwkmngi8_0-5-rgb_front alright we have cut our paper and put down our sticky strip
1sokwkmngi8_1-5-rgb_front the next thing were going to do is assemble them
1sokwkmngi8_10-5-rgb_front i am not sure if there still out there but they used to be out there at any of the restaurants and stuff that had things to go
1sokwkmngi8_11-5-rgb_front so real quickly i am going to do it again
1sokwkmngi8_12-5-rgb_front just roll it up so it resembles like a tube of your empty toilet paper roll
1sokwkmngi8_13-5-rgb_front crimp those edges seal them together throw in some more chocolates
1sokwkmngi8_14-5-rgb_front if a little chocolate is good more is better
1sokwkmngi8_15-5-rgb_front seal that edge slide it in your crimper back and forth two or three times to help seal that edge and there we have two sour cream containers already prefilled with chocolate
1sokwkmngi8_16-5-rgb_front the next thing i am going to do is show what other things you can do with these really cute sour cream containers
1sokwkmngi8_2-5-rgb_front i have already peeled off the red top layer on the sticky strip on this one and all you are going to do is roll it like a toilet paper roll because that is what it is going to resemble when you get it done
1sokwkmngi8_3-5-rgb_front so roll that and then you can see this sticky strip you are going to go ahead and press that side down and then you are going to press this side the opposite way
1sokwkmngi8_4-5-rgb_front but before we seal this up we need to put something really fun in it
1sokwkmngi8_5-5-rgb_front this is a good time where the kids could buy their mom some chocolates where they could put a little note into their mom or maybe a bracelet or some diamonds anything like that is nice
1sokwkmngi8_6-5-rgb_front so were going to go ahead and put some chocolates i have just got some hershey is nuggets in here
1sokwkmngi8_7-5-rgb_front so we have pushed one one way were going to push one the other way and then were going to take our crimper and this is just going to kind of help seal the edges
1sokwkmngi8_8-5-rgb_front alright so we re going to run it through place it in the handle and then were going to go about one two three back and forth a couple times just to keep that edge nice and tight
1sokwkmngi8_9-5-rgb_front the same way on this side and it looks just like those sour cream containers that you used to be able to get
1sozyg3zxkm_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is caroline and this is amanda we are here at encore gymnastics and we are going to teach you how to do a front flip
1sozyg3zxkm_1-5-rgb_front we are going to start by stretching so go ahead and stretch your ankles right and left
1sozyg3zxkm_10-5-rgb_front very good
1sozyg3zxkm_11-5-rgb_front the next step we would do that same exact thing but she is going to punch up and pull her knees into her stomach so into a tuck position same thing pull your knees in this time
1sozyg3zxkm_12-5-rgb_front very good
1sozyg3zxkm_13-5-rgb_front so we are going to have three body positions the first one is going to be going up in the straight body the second one is over into the tuck and the third one is again with the bent knees both bent knees landing landing
1sozyg3zxkm_14-5-rgb_front very good right there so those are the three positions your body is going to go through in the front tuck
1sozyg3zxkm_15-5-rgb_front we are going to go ahead and bring her up onto the block to show you all the way through
1sozyg3zxkm_16-5-rgb_front you are going to start up and big jump finish on the other side very good
1sozyg3zxkm_17-5-rgb_front we are going to have her do that all on her own
1sozyg3zxkm_18-5-rgb_front she is not quite landing it because she is leaning a little bit forward so when you do your front tuck you are going to want to go up a little bit more go ahead and do one more for us
1sozyg3zxkm_19-5-rgb_front pull it all the way around
1sozyg3zxkm_2-5-rgb_front turn around in a couple circles on each leg
1sozyg3zxkm_20-5-rgb_front and there it is that is a front tuck
1sozyg3zxkm_3-5-rgb_front very good
1sozyg3zxkm_4-5-rgb_front you are also going to want to stretch your hamstrings so she is going to stand up and grab the back of her foot and push this forward
1sozyg3zxkm_5-5-rgb_front a good way to make this stretch work is by squeezing your bottom and the other leg
1sozyg3zxkm_6-5-rgb_front there is a lot of stress on your legs when you land a front tuck because there is so much momentum in it
1sozyg3zxkm_7-5-rgb_front and you always want to stretch your wrists and your neck as well
1sozyg3zxkm_8-5-rgb_front very good
1sozyg3zxkm_9-5-rgb_front for starting a front tuck you are going to punch off the ground so she is going to take a few steps and then just punch straight up
1swtfvvym_y_0-5-rgb_front for most my sewing i do i like to rip my material instead of having to sew it
1swtfvvym_y_1-5-rgb_front if it has straight lines the ripping gives you generally a really nice straight line right along the fabric the grain of the fabric
1swtfvvym_y_10-5-rgb_front and you are going to need however many strips wide you want to go plus the lining plus the strap
1swtfvvym_y_11-5-rgb_front and that is how you rip your strips
1swtfvvym_y_2-5-rgb_front so what i am going to do is go ahead and take my material you could probably get away with about of a yard this is actually a full yard
1swtfvvym_y_3-5-rgb_front i am going to fold it in half and cut it just rip it all the way down
1swtfvvym_y_4-5-rgb_front this side will be for your lining that is about how wide you need
1swtfvvym_y_5-5-rgb_front now if you are using different types of material you are obviously going to have to rip strips out of each of them
1swtfvvym_y_6-5-rgb_front you will not need it quite that wide but that just gives you lots of room to decide how big you want it to be
1swtfvvym_y_7-5-rgb_front and then for the remaining strips just take the other material
1swtfvvym_y_8-5-rgb_front a lot of times when i rip my strips this is exactly how i cut them i will cut one i will cut it in half and i will keep that piece for lining and then i will rip the other pieces for patch working together or for straps for my purses or for a bias string to go through a skirt
1swtfvvym_y_9-5-rgb_front having it ripped in strips is just really handy
1t2euqlbttk_0-5-rgb_front this traditional stretch is called the twisted pretzel
1t2euqlbttk_1-5-rgb_front now it may sound intimidating but it is a great stretch for your back your hips overall stretch
1t2euqlbttk_10-5-rgb_front and then engage your abdominal muscles lifting your knees up and then twist over to the other side
1t2euqlbttk_11-5-rgb_front and you want to try to get your knees all the way over
1t2euqlbttk_12-5-rgb_front close your eyes hold that position for about thirty seconds and then come on up and then switch legs
1t2euqlbttk_13-5-rgb_front taking the right over left hooking and then coming over to the side
1t2euqlbttk_14-5-rgb_front and that is your twisted pretzel
1t2euqlbttk_2-5-rgb_front so come on down to your mat
1t2euqlbttk_3-5-rgb_front and you want to just have your feet on the floor your knees are bent
1t2euqlbttk_4-5-rgb_front take your left leg and cross it over your right leg
1t2euqlbttk_5-5-rgb_front then take your left foot and hook it behind your right ankle as you lift your feet up off the floor
1t2euqlbttk_6-5-rgb_front now take your arms out like a t and then gently roll your knees over to the left side
1t2euqlbttk_7-5-rgb_front turn your head to the right side
1t2euqlbttk_8-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that you are keeping your shoulder blades on the mat
1t2euqlbttk_9-5-rgb_front and just breathe nice and easy holding the stretch for about thirty seconds
1t7ljgcshg0_0-5-rgb_front now we are moving on to the foundation
1t7ljgcshg0_1-5-rgb_front we want that glowy dewy healthy look
1t7ljgcshg0_10-5-rgb_front you just put a little more of a concentrated amount where you need it if you want to use it as a concealer
1t7ljgcshg0_11-5-rgb_front it all depends on what you are trying to cover
1t7ljgcshg0_12-5-rgb_front look up for me
1t7ljgcshg0_13-5-rgb_front her skin is so nice that i do not really have to use an extra concealer
1t7ljgcshg0_14-5-rgb_front i can just use the foundation as a concealer
1t7ljgcshg0_15-5-rgb_front if you have a blemish that really needs covering up or a scar then you may need to go for a more heavier concealer or even a heavier foundation depending on your skin
1t7ljgcshg0_16-5-rgb_front make sure you blend blend
1t7ljgcshg0_17-5-rgb_front you do not want it to look like you have a ton of foundation on
1t7ljgcshg0_18-5-rgb_front you want it just to look like your skin is flawless
1t7ljgcshg0_19-5-rgb_front take it down the neck a little bit
1t7ljgcshg0_2-5-rgb_front i am using a very sheer foundation
1t7ljgcshg0_20-5-rgb_front just make sure everything is completely blended
1t7ljgcshg0_21-5-rgb_front then once your foundation is all blended in take a nice pressed powder or finishing powder and dust it right on top
1t7ljgcshg0_22-5-rgb_front do not use too much but use a significant amount to make sure your skin looks nice and flawless
1t7ljgcshg0_23-5-rgb_front do not go too much around the eye area because powder tends to seep into the lines or on the eyes
1t7ljgcshg0_24-5-rgb_front just stick to the face down the neck a little bit
1t7ljgcshg0_25-5-rgb_front do not use too much powder
1t7ljgcshg0_26-5-rgb_front again you want it to look a little more dewy but you also want to kind of finish it off with a little bit of powder
1t7ljgcshg0_27-5-rgb_front it just makes everything look so much smoother and nicer
1t7ljgcshg0_28-5-rgb_front now we are ready to do bronzer and blush
1t7ljgcshg0_3-5-rgb_front almost a tinted moisturizer
1t7ljgcshg0_4-5-rgb_front it is very hydrating and moisturizing
1t7ljgcshg0_5-5-rgb_front it is not a matifying foundation
1t7ljgcshg0_6-5-rgb_front if you have a drier skin type this is great
1t7ljgcshg0_7-5-rgb_front if you have a more oiler skin type and you feel like you get very shiny then you might want to use a more matifying foundation but you still want to use a liquid because this is a glowy dewy healthy look
1t7ljgcshg0_8-5-rgb_front you do not want it to look to flat and matte
1t7ljgcshg0_9-5-rgb_front she has great skin so i am using the foundation also as a concealer around the nose under the eyes
1ta-rdz7hfy_0-5-rgb_front this hairstyle is good for showing movement because as you can see it is ranting off of her face like she is in a wind tunnel or like basically like she is going uh shaking her head out that is going to give it flare personality style your own little sense of you
1ta-rdz7hfy_1-5-rgb_front the easiest way to do that obviously is to visualize shaking your hair out what it is going to do take a picture camera captures it right in the middle of a shake it is going to be out like that like static electricity
1ta-rdz7hfy_2-5-rgb_front so draw your part and then just but again you do not want straight lines it is going to be going all different directions
1ta-rdz7hfy_3-5-rgb_front it is no such thing as a bad hair day when you are designing fashion design just start a new trend
1tb2ebt2wqi_1-5-rgb_front i am here today to show you how to make quick and easy spanish recipes
1tb2ebt2wqi_10-5-rgb_front just like that now
1tb2ebt2wqi_11-5-rgb_front put this into the pot because it has to sizzle a little and it starts cooking immediately and just like that we have the beginnings of our beautiful yellow rice
1tb2ebt2wqi_2-5-rgb_front over in this pot we have finished our quick and easy spanish style chicken and sausage and see how it has got this nice sauce dripping down and the peas are still green and everything
1tb2ebt2wqi_3-5-rgb_front we need something to sop up that sauce
1tb2ebt2wqi_4-5-rgb_front over here i have got some onion that i am just going to throw into the food processor and a little garlic we are going to see if we can get that out of the head
1tb2ebt2wqi_5-5-rgb_front this is always a problem
1tb2ebt2wqi_6-5-rgb_front it never wants to work with me never ever like now
1tb2ebt2wqi_7-5-rgb_front one clove of garlic and over in the hot pan we have got some oil heating just a little vegetable oil
1tb2ebt2wqi_8-5-rgb_front you can use olive oil which is what i usually use but we do not want to overpower our flavor so we are just going to stick with the vegetable oil
1tb2ebt2wqi_9-5-rgb_front just give it a nice mince nice and fine and small and you know that they are minced whenever it starts pulling away from the middle and starts spreading out to the sides
1tu3wpd2oj0_0-5-rgb_front now we are going to decorate our boat
1tu3wpd2oj0_1-5-rgb_front we are going to be decorating the boat with permanent marker because we do not want any of the colors to run when the boat goes into the water
1tu3wpd2oj0_10-5-rgb_front the next decoration we want to do is we are going to go to the base of the boat and we are going to make kind of a line down which will kind of look like the rim
1tu3wpd2oj0_11-5-rgb_front i guess like the rubber boarder that goes around the boat so it does not bang into anything when it comes close to the dock or when it gets tied up
1tu3wpd2oj0_12-5-rgb_front so we will put a line around the border around the base of the boat and it will not just be one line we will actually fill in some other colors to make it stand out a little more
1tu3wpd2oj0_13-5-rgb_front this is really the key to this one decoration is kind of the key to making it kind of stand out and look like a somewhat of a real boat
1tu3wpd2oj0_14-5-rgb_front this is really even though it may not realize it this really stands out on boats that you have that thick border going around the base
1tu3wpd2oj0_15-5-rgb_front so this will help us make it really look more authentic
1tu3wpd2oj0_16-5-rgb_front we will put our first color around we used a red
1tu3wpd2oj0_17-5-rgb_front we will go ahead and take a second color and complete the shape to it
1tu3wpd2oj0_18-5-rgb_front so we have made two lines and we have made a waved line going down the middle
1tu3wpd2oj0_19-5-rgb_front now the front of our boat needs to have a window so we will use our thin marker to make our border
1tu3wpd2oj0_2-5-rgb_front the first thing we are going to do is outline different shapes on the boat
1tu3wpd2oj0_20-5-rgb_front you can experiment with some different markers
1tu3wpd2oj0_21-5-rgb_front the lines come out not as dark when you are using makers as opposed to if you were going to use some paint
1tu3wpd2oj0_22-5-rgb_front a type of paint that is good for it is like we said earlier the type of paint would be the same paint that is used to decorate cloth like a because that is the type of paint that you can throw in the washing machine and it does not come off
1tu3wpd2oj0_23-5-rgb_front of course when our boat is placed in the water we want the paint to stay on as well
1tu3wpd2oj0_24-5-rgb_front so the paint would definitely give it more of a stronger effect but we also wanted to show you that most people have these markers around their house and we wanted to make the project as practical as possible to show you that it can also be done with these markers
1tu3wpd2oj0_25-5-rgb_front i will put a little decoration on the flag we will just put a star
1tu3wpd2oj0_26-5-rgb_front you can put your family insignia if you have one
1tu3wpd2oj0_27-5-rgb_front and here we see that once the boat is placed into water it actually does float
1tu3wpd2oj0_28-5-rgb_front so it is a really nice project for kids and they come out with a nice toy that they can play with at bath time
1tu3wpd2oj0_29-5-rgb_front if you are going to put it into the bath the glue and the color should hold but i would take out the toothpick obviously might be a bit of a safety hazard
1tu3wpd2oj0_3-5-rgb_front for our design we are going to be making some windows on the top layer
1tu3wpd2oj0_30-5-rgb_front but they can have a lot of fun with the boat soak it up with water watch it go under come up again and it is a lot of fun
1tu3wpd2oj0_4-5-rgb_front so use the black thin marker
1tu3wpd2oj0_5-5-rgb_front permanent marker
1tu3wpd2oj0_6-5-rgb_front we made our outline and now we are going to fill it in with some colors
1tu3wpd2oj0_7-5-rgb_front i am using a blue color now
1tu3wpd2oj0_8-5-rgb_front we go ahead and do the other side the same with the windows
1tu3wpd2oj0_9-5-rgb_front it is easier to outline everything first so when you draw put the actual colors on they keep their shape and also the border around the different shapes gives a nice makes it stand out a little more gives a nice affect to it has a nice touch
1tuhpdtbock_0-5-rgb_front alright let is talk about mounting the rod into the reel
1tuhpdtbock_1-5-rgb_front now we already have a mounted rod here
1tuhpdtbock_10-5-rgb_front sometimes you will drop the line and it will come all the way out
1tuhpdtbock_11-5-rgb_front alright so anyways there we go
1tuhpdtbock_12-5-rgb_front now we simply close this bale up
1tuhpdtbock_13-5-rgb_front reel up the slack and you have threaded the rod
1tuhpdtbock_14-5-rgb_front and if you will notice the line always goes through this roller on the top
1tuhpdtbock_15-5-rgb_front because that is what actually puts the line back on to the reel when you actually wind this
1tuhpdtbock_16-5-rgb_front it actually this rotates around and puts the line back onto the spool
1tuhpdtbock_2-5-rgb_front this is a spinning outfit
1tuhpdtbock_3-5-rgb_front and if you will notice the spinning outfit always sits below the reel seat
1tuhpdtbock_4-5-rgb_front so it is a nice balance
1tuhpdtbock_5-5-rgb_front it is easy to cast like that
1tuhpdtbock_6-5-rgb_front but once you have accomplished it you still have to thread the line through the guides so with a spinning outfit what you need to do is you need to open this bale up
1tuhpdtbock_7-5-rgb_front this is a line bale
1tuhpdtbock_8-5-rgb_front take your line and basically just thread right through the guides
1tuhpdtbock_9-5-rgb_front go all the way to the end
1th9xt0ucke_0-5-rgb_front next we are going to be doing some chest expansion and we are going to move in to camel pose as well here seated in our chair
1th9xt0ucke_1-5-rgb_front as we get older we tend to allow our shoulders to hunch forward and so these poses are going to help create length through the front of the chest as well as contracting the muscles in the back become weak as they are stretched over time from that hunching effect
1th9xt0ucke_2-5-rgb_front so let is start with just a simple chest expansion
1th9xt0ucke_3-5-rgb_front sitting up nice and tall again on the edge of your chair and let is reach back holding on to that back of the chair and we are squeezing our shoulder blades towards each other and allowing the front of the chest to open up and getting a nice stretch and we will just focus on holding that pose and breathing and then releasing
1th9xt0ucke_4-5-rgb_front now from here we can move on to camel pose or if that felt pretty good and that felt like where you should be at then let is continue to practice that for a while
1th9xt0ucke_5-5-rgb_front if you would like to move on to camel pose let is bring either flat fists or flat palms and we are going to place one hand on either side of the spine right where the top of the hip meets the spine and you can feel those bones in your back
1th9xt0ucke_6-5-rgb_front we are placing the hands there to support the spine and again we are squeezing the shoulder blades towards each other and then we can gently start to bend through the back focusing on opening the chest towards the ceiling and we can hold that for a few breaths and then we will slowly bring ourselves up and especially out of camel pose but also that chest expansion we want to counter stretch with a gentle seated child is pose so we are just going to hang ourselves forward and we can rest the hands on the leg and that is just going to counter stretch the spine from any of our back bending
1tix6cnqko4_0-5-rgb_front let is try a folkloric move that we call the horsie step
1tix6cnqko4_1-5-rgb_front this is base on some of the arabian horses and the way that they toss their head up and down
1tix6cnqko4_10-5-rgb_front you want to keep them nice and even
1tix6cnqko4_11-5-rgb_front so as you bend you are going to press into the floor
1tix6cnqko4_12-5-rgb_front so goes down down up down up down up
1tix6cnqko4_13-5-rgb_front good
1tix6cnqko4_14-5-rgb_front now you need to keep the body nice and relax here
1tix6cnqko4_15-5-rgb_front this is a folkloric move
1tix6cnqko4_16-5-rgb_front so you want it to be very natural looking
1tix6cnqko4_17-5-rgb_front now we can also add a little bit of a chest lift there to contrast the movement down in your feet
1tix6cnqko4_18-5-rgb_front so as you heel presses the chest is going to lift up kind of like a garbage can lid
1tix6cnqko4_19-5-rgb_front so you are going to go up and press and press and press
1tix6cnqko4_2-5-rgb_front but there is varying degrees of how much you can exaggerate this movement
1tix6cnqko4_20-5-rgb_front so try this on both sides in the mirror and make sure your knees are staying nice and even
1tix6cnqko4_3-5-rgb_front let is start with the more subtle version of it
1tix6cnqko4_4-5-rgb_front let is start with our feet slightly together and our weighted leg is going to take most of the weight here
1tix6cnqko4_5-5-rgb_front and we are going to start with our foot with the heel press toward the floor
1tix6cnqko4_6-5-rgb_front our accent is going to be going down on the first beat
1tix6cnqko4_7-5-rgb_front so it is going to be on the downbeat
1tix6cnqko4_8-5-rgb_front so we are going to be going down and both knees are going to bend the same amount okay
1tix6cnqko4_9-5-rgb_front so you do not want one leg here and this one more straight
1tlnisotk9q_1-5-rgb_front we did some exercises today that are going to help with that but the biggest thing you have to do as a rider is to stay in that turn until it is time to complete it
1tlnisotk9q_10-5-rgb_front see how he comes out really wide
1tlnisotk9q_11-5-rgb_front that is because i did not keep him held in there
1tlnisotk9q_12-5-rgb_front what we want is we want to approach this barrel with our pocket keep him held in there until we are at the proper place to exit it
1tlnisotk9q_13-5-rgb_front then those hands come forward and out he goes
1tlnisotk9q_14-5-rgb_front so it is as simple as just keeping your horse in that turn
1tlnisotk9q_15-5-rgb_front if you want your horse to finish it and not come out wide you just sit a little bit longer
1tlnisotk9q_16-5-rgb_front people think that sometimes that actually adds time because your sitting longer but what it does is it straightens up that run home which actually shaves a lot of time in the end
1tlnisotk9q_2-5-rgb_front so we are going to go ahead and we are going to come up to this barrel and i am going to show you how that works
1tlnisotk9q_3-5-rgb_front this would be a third barrel you have got a little pocket coming in here
1tlnisotk9q_4-5-rgb_front watch how i stay committed to this turn
1tlnisotk9q_5-5-rgb_front i am holding my horse down and back until i finish it
1tlnisotk9q_6-5-rgb_front then i allow him to go forward
1tlnisotk9q_7-5-rgb_front watch the difference between that and when i allow him to go forward to soon
1tlnisotk9q_8-5-rgb_front i am going to stay committed to the turn to start with and then half way around i am going forward
1tlnisotk9q_9-5-rgb_front watch where he goes out
1toul5iylde_0-5-rgb_front now as you have finished your massaging and your acupressure points the last thing to remember is what we call closing the session
1toul5iylde_1-5-rgb_front you want to be sure that once you finish all these techniques on the animal and the animal is nice and relaxed you just stay with them let them lie down let them enjoy themselves
1toul5iylde_2-5-rgb_front you pet them talk to them this is a time when you just want them to relax so they are going to get the benefit of all that hard work you just did for them
1toul5iylde_3-5-rgb_front it is not a time to take them out running it is not a time to feed them just like when you get a massage after your massage it is nice to lay there quietly and let the bones and the muscles and the joints all relax and get the full benefit of the massaging and pressuring that they have just gotten you are going to do the same for your dog to make sure that all that hard work is of much benefit as possible to them
1toul5iylde_4-5-rgb_front it is nice to do this at the end of the day because then the dog can go to sleep and spent the whole night relaxing and enjoying that extra good feeling he has gotten from you
1tsfcqyft1a_0-5-rgb_front if you find an english three speed at a yard sale it may have some interesting accessories on it
1tsfcqyft1a_1-5-rgb_front they may not have been on the bike when it was originally purchased but they were probably purchased from the bike shop later on and put on the bike
1tsfcqyft1a_10-5-rgb_front another accessory here is the classic saddle bag
1tsfcqyft1a_11-5-rgb_front you always see these attached to the back of a leather brook saddle
1tsfcqyft1a_12-5-rgb_front some of these were made of leather this is vinyl
1tsfcqyft1a_13-5-rgb_front these are getting really hard to find there really easy to put on as a matter of fact there are eyelets on the back of the saddle for mounting them
1tsfcqyft1a_14-5-rgb_front basically these straps go through the eyelets one there one there and then one strap around the seat post and you have got a handy saddle bag
1tsfcqyft1a_2-5-rgb_front a wicker basket which i showed in the previous segment is a classic add on particularly for a woman is bike
1tsfcqyft1a_3-5-rgb_front the men is bikes did not really use the wicker baskets but they look great on a woman is bike
1tsfcqyft1a_4-5-rgb_front lighting as this bike has this is after market lighting or add on lighting that is another popular accessory
1tsfcqyft1a_5-5-rgb_front another popular thing is a cyclometer
1tsfcqyft1a_6-5-rgb_front it is a very simple mechanical device let is you know how many miles you have gone
1tsfcqyft1a_7-5-rgb_front there is a read out on the face of this and there is a key which you attach to the spoke and there is a little wheel here that gets turned every time that key passes by
1tsfcqyft1a_8-5-rgb_front so as this bike the wheels spinning forward the key goes by it turns this lever on the cyclometer and it slowly ticks up the miles that you have covered
1tsfcqyft1a_9-5-rgb_front this one looks like it is got about fifteen hundred miles on it which is a lot
1tulvsuotyy_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is lauren with makeup by dodge and today i am going to teach you how to do your makeup in five minutes flat
1tulvsuotyy_1-5-rgb_front so first let is think about the problem areas we have
1tulvsuotyy_10-5-rgb_front but make sure your bronzer goes well with your skin
1tulvsuotyy_11-5-rgb_front the orange on the face just usually does not cut it
1tulvsuotyy_12-5-rgb_front when you apply your bronzer you could just sweep it on the on the out skirts of your face by your hair line and bring it down your cheeks maybe down on your jaw line
1tulvsuotyy_13-5-rgb_front touch your chin
1tulvsuotyy_14-5-rgb_front touch your nose
1tulvsuotyy_15-5-rgb_front do it on the other side
1tulvsuotyy_16-5-rgb_front and so you do not even have to worry about breaking out the eye shadow you can use that bronzer or that blush if you wanted to put a little blush on instead of some bronzer
1tulvsuotyy_17-5-rgb_front and close your eyes please
1tulvsuotyy_18-5-rgb_front just go ahead and sweep them across your eyes and just tie your whole face in and bring in a little bit more life and a little warmth to it
1tulvsuotyy_19-5-rgb_front another thing you can do is just apply a little waterproof mascara if you do not want to have to worry about touching it up later
1tulvsuotyy_2-5-rgb_front essentially what you are trying to do when you do your makeup just in five minutes is to get out the door right
1tulvsuotyy_20-5-rgb_front just curl your eyelashes if you have time swipe on some mascara
1tulvsuotyy_21-5-rgb_front and to make you lips more youthful and a little juicier go ahead and put on some lip gloss
1tulvsuotyy_22-5-rgb_front do not do not go into the the lip stick thing that takes a little bit more time and effort
1tulvsuotyy_23-5-rgb_front but just put a little lip gloss maybe some chap stick and you have a very sun kissed and youthful look just in under five minutes
1tulvsuotyy_3-5-rgb_front and to go on with your day
1tulvsuotyy_4-5-rgb_front and you are trying to greet the world with a very even bright energetic kind of face
1tulvsuotyy_5-5-rgb_front so some problem areas that we might have is discoloration of the skin which is very normal among many women
1tulvsuotyy_6-5-rgb_front not not many women have porcelain skin so to try to even out your complexion you can have some tinted moisturizer
1tulvsuotyy_7-5-rgb_front just swipe that all over your face or if you have some dark circles or some problem blemishes just go ahead and swipe some concealer under those eye eyes where your dark circle and dab at those blemishes very precisely with your concealer and blend
1tulvsuotyy_8-5-rgb_front make sure you blend
1tulvsuotyy_9-5-rgb_front another thing to bring some more color some more life to your face would to apply some bronzer
1tvy-lejj0w_1-5-rgb_front one of the things that you are going to want to be careful of is dehydration
1tvy-lejj0w_2-5-rgb_front a lot of the times we tend to visit theme parks during the summer months and they can obviously be very very warm and aside from sunscreen and keeping yourself well protected from the sun you are also going to want to stay hydrated and the best way to stay well hydrated is with water
1tvy-lejj0w_3-5-rgb_front you really are going to want to avoid sodas and juices that have a lot of sugar in them
1tvy-lejj0w_4-5-rgb_front if you are feeling like you are low on electrolytes you can go ahead and drink some sort of gatorade or electrolyte drink but really the best way is to just keep a constant steady flow of water in your system and that will help you avoid any sort of affect of dehydration
1tvy-lejj0w_5-5-rgb_front dehydration can ruin an outing very quickly
1tvy-lejj0w_6-5-rgb_front it can cause headaches and exhaustion and can really make you feel very ill and not at all like wanting to run around and have fun so be sure that you stay hydrated
1ty3qyrcp-i_0-5-rgb_front so only a couple more steps in our kitchen painting project before we are actually ready to put the paint on
1ty3qyrcp-i_1-5-rgb_front we are still preparing the surface
1ty3qyrcp-i_10-5-rgb_front so for our case here we are going to just use a little bit of this fiberglass tape and we are going to crumple it up
1ty3qyrcp-i_11-5-rgb_front you could actually use anything
1ty3qyrcp-i_12-5-rgb_front you can use crumpled up newspaper that is pretty common for plaster repairs or anything that you have laying around
1ty3qyrcp-i_13-5-rgb_front okay we are going to just crumple it up into a little ball and just start to fill our area
1ty3qyrcp-i_14-5-rgb_front that way we will need less wood putty and it is going to dry a lot faster
1ty3qyrcp-i_15-5-rgb_front let is see i am just going to crumple up another little piece
1ty3qyrcp-i_16-5-rgb_front just kind of jam it in there really good
1ty3qyrcp-i_17-5-rgb_front so it is basically doing most of the filling with your backer whatever you are crumpling and sticking in there
1ty3qyrcp-i_18-5-rgb_front and then you do not really have to do too much puttying
1ty3qyrcp-i_19-5-rgb_front so i am going to take my wood putty and a small putty knife and i am just going to goop it up apply a bunch of product in there
1ty3qyrcp-i_2-5-rgb_front i noticed as i was going along that there is actually a piece of wood missing from the trim here right next to our wall repair
1ty3qyrcp-i_20-5-rgb_front make sure that i am pushing it into the backing just kind of getting the whole thing filled
1ty3qyrcp-i_21-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that you do push a decent amount in
1ty3qyrcp-i_22-5-rgb_front then this is a case where you may need one or two or several coats
1ty3qyrcp-i_23-5-rgb_front and you are going to give it a slight sand as well so you do not have to perfect on this stage
1ty3qyrcp-i_24-5-rgb_front okay
1ty3qyrcp-i_25-5-rgb_front now we are going to let that dry and we are going to move on to the next step
1ty3qyrcp-i_3-5-rgb_front so i thought i was going to take some time and show you guys how to repair that with some wood putty
1ty3qyrcp-i_4-5-rgb_front now normally we go around with the wood putty and fill minor holes and nicks and things like that
1ty3qyrcp-i_5-5-rgb_front and it dries pretty fast and it holds pretty solid and it has the properties of wood
1ty3qyrcp-i_6-5-rgb_front in this case it is really deep as you can see and there is actually a piece of wall missing
1ty3qyrcp-i_7-5-rgb_front so we are going to have to put a backing on that
1ty3qyrcp-i_8-5-rgb_front any time you are caulking or filling anything any hole that is deeper than about a half an inch you are going to want to back it with something
1ty3qyrcp-i_9-5-rgb_front meaning basically to just stick something else in there so you are not continuously putting too much putty in otherwise it will take forever to dry
1tymrhmv7ne_0-5-rgb_front after we have massaged both legs with a hot stone i am going to show you how i place the stones on the legs
1tymrhmv7ne_1-5-rgb_front we are using a larger placement stones
1tymrhmv7ne_10-5-rgb_front another larger stone round in shape to cover the calf
1tymrhmv7ne_11-5-rgb_front i like to do some compressions just to soothe the heat into the muscles
1tymrhmv7ne_12-5-rgb_front and for an extra treat i like the client to hold a stone in each hand
1tymrhmv7ne_13-5-rgb_front interactive
1tymrhmv7ne_14-5-rgb_front if they have cold hands it is great for warming
1tymrhmv7ne_15-5-rgb_front and that is tone placement on the legs in prone
1tymrhmv7ne_2-5-rgb_front two stones over the hamstrings
1tymrhmv7ne_3-5-rgb_front if it feel too warm you can double up on the sheet
1tymrhmv7ne_4-5-rgb_front but always check in with your client and how the temperature is
1tymrhmv7ne_5-5-rgb_front then we are going to place around the sheet stone on the calf
1tymrhmv7ne_6-5-rgb_front and i like to cover the stones with sheet to keep them in place and also to keep the heat in
1tymrhmv7ne_7-5-rgb_front i am going to do this on both sides of the legs
1tymrhmv7ne_8-5-rgb_front larger stones on the larger muscle groups
1tymrhmv7ne_9-5-rgb_front covering them to keep them in place and to retain the heat
1uaq4puqrwo_0-3-rgb_front athena reich in this clip i am going to talk about the actors union
1uaq4puqrwo_1-3-rgb_front there is three ways you can be involved or not involved in the union
1uaq4puqrwo_10-3-rgb_front the last level is
1uaq4puqrwo_11-3-rgb_front you might get there
1uaq4puqrwo_12-3-rgb_front you can wait a long time and you might not get seen but you can try
1uaq4puqrwo_2-3-rgb_front you could be a union member you can be an emc member or you can be
1uaq4puqrwo_3-3-rgb_front i am a union member so i have my actors equity card
1uaq4puqrwo_4-3-rgb_front this means that i can get into the actors union lounge and then i can go early in the morning to an audition and i can sign up and i can actually get a time a slot
1uaq4puqrwo_5-3-rgb_front now if i am in emc that is one step down from being in the union it means that i have done a certain number of weeks but than weeks of work in the theater
1uaq4puqrwo_6-3-rgb_front and what that means is i can get up there early and i get on an emc list and after all the equity people who have come have auditioned then i need get to go
1uaq4puqrwo_7-3-rgb_front so a lot of times as emc it is pretty tough
1uaq4puqrwo_8-3-rgb_front you gotta work really hard
1uaq4puqrwo_9-3-rgb_front you go there you show up and you might not get seen
1ub3hyum1m4_1-5-rgb_front so here is a kit that you could do all on your own that we sell as a complete kit

1ub3hyum1m4_16-5-rgb_front then we give you tracing paper a whole book of tracing paper
1ub3hyum1m4_17-5-rgb_front remember you could trace that little duck on the actual picture and then cut it into the matting
1ub3hyum1m4_18-5-rgb_front then we are going to give you different templates that you can cut in your matting all different kinds feathers leaves
1ub3hyum1m4_19-5-rgb_front then remember when we put the two mats together
1ub3hyum1m4_2-5-rgb_front when you get this kit you can start cutting mats the moment you unwrap it

1ub3hyum1m4_21-5-rgb_front we have a razor blade that once you cut your opening if it does not fall out you are going to need a little razor blade to cut that corner

1ubftrcal1c_0-5-rgb_front now just some simple rules to follow
1ubftrcal1c_1-5-rgb_front first of all when you are at work do not send personal emails
1ubftrcal1c_10-5-rgb_front that is a bad idea because anyone at any time can have access to these emails
1ubftrcal1c_11-5-rgb_front personal information in writing via email will always come back to haunt you
1ubftrcal1c_12-5-rgb_front do not do it
1ubftrcal1c_2-5-rgb_front that is just bad news all the way around
1ubftrcal1c_3-5-rgb_front if you have to send a personal email i would certainly make sure that the boss knew that you were going to send a personal email
1ubftrcal1c_4-5-rgb_front i am pretty sure that people have been fired for doing way too much personal business via the internet or emails when they are at work
1ubftrcal1c_5-5-rgb_front all you want to talk about in your emails at work is work
1ubftrcal1c_6-5-rgb_front you want to plan your message carefully
1ubftrcal1c_7-5-rgb_front you want to talk about goals you want to talk about schedules you want to talk about research you want to talk about meetings you want to talk about company news
1ubftrcal1c_8-5-rgb_front keep everything personal out of it
1ubftrcal1c_9-5-rgb_front when i talk about personal messages you do not want to send personal messages to your friends but you do not want personal information in your business emails like you are sending an email to a but you are busy talking in your email about what a jerk the boss is
1ud6mhuyox0_0-5-rgb_front i would like to talk now about the meaning of a bedroom and the purpose of the bedroom
1ud6mhuyox0_1-5-rgb_front so the meaning of a bedroom is that bedroom represents our inner self
1ud6mhuyox0_2-5-rgb_front and when i go to people is homes and i see that public spaces downstairs are very nice and neat and beautiful and designed and when i go to the bedroom their bedroom and see that it is cluttered it is dark it is not attended
1ud6mhuyox0_3-5-rgb_front so it tells me something about the person
1ud6mhuyox0_4-5-rgb_front it tells me that they probably are not confident enough in themselves
1ud6mhuyox0_5-5-rgb_front or perhaps they do not take good care of themselves
1ud6mhuyox0_6-5-rgb_front or perhaps they do not take good care of their relationship
1ud6mhuyox0_7-5-rgb_front so their purpose of the bedroom is to have a good night sleep of course
1ud6mhuyox0_8-5-rgb_front it is rest rejuvenation
1ud6mhuyox0_9-5-rgb_front and another purpose is to make love to have relationship to honor your relationship in a bedroom
1ue7-4mori0_0-5-rgb_front i am going to cut open this little pouch here
1ue7-4mori0_1-5-rgb_front this is my solution
1ue7-4mori0_10-5-rgb_front i kind of like the shirt i am wearing i probably should not even be wearing it while i do this
1ue7-4mori0_11-5-rgb_front but you want to be really careful
1ue7-4mori0_12_13-5-rgb_front i am wearing gloves and you want to be sure you are in a well ventilated area so the next part i am going to make is part b i am going to show you how to make that part next
1ue7-4mori0_2-5-rgb_front pour it into one quart of water
1ue7-4mori0_3-5-rgb_front now i am probably one of the only dark room people that actually i really like using old cooking implements
1ue7-4mori0_4-5-rgb_front this little whip works really well
1ue7-4mori0_5-5-rgb_front i make sure that all my chemistry is mixed up
1ue7-4mori0_6-5-rgb_front i do not want to see any browns in there
1ue7-4mori0_7-5-rgb_front i want it to be clear
1ue7-4mori0_8-5-rgb_front that is my fair cyanide right there
1ue7-4mori0_9-5-rgb_front it is like bleach it gets on anything it is going to stain it
1uezfusvyua_0-5-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson
1uezfusvyua_1-5-rgb_front one thing that you have to understand about the game of rebounding especially if you are playing a zone if who to box out on the zone
1uezfusvyua_10-5-rgb_front you find the opposite colored jersey and you put a body on it
1uezfusvyua_11-5-rgb_front it is very very important not only man to man but especially in the zone to box somebody out
1uezfusvyua_2-5-rgb_front now obviously if you are in a man to man situation you are on the guy that you are guarding
1uezfusvyua_3-5-rgb_front you know who you are guarding you know how they shoot you know how they box out so it is much much easier
1uezfusvyua_4-5-rgb_front but when your team plays a lot of zone like we do you have got to learn how to box out and the most important thing is you have to understand the players that are in your area
1uezfusvyua_5-5-rgb_front so as zach right here is playing the top of our zone he has to realize who is out here
1uezfusvyua_6-5-rgb_front he has to know not only where the offensive guys are and the positions that they are on the floor he also has to know where his fellow defenders are
1uezfusvyua_7-5-rgb_front he knows if there is somebody else that is up here then they have to communicate and when the shot goes up zach will say i have got the wing you get the top and then i would box out here and zach would box out there
1uezfusvyua_8-5-rgb_front one thing you cannot do in the zone which we see a lot is when the shot goes up if zach just turns around to get the rebound you are going to have this man from the top blitzing in and you are going to have the man from the wing coming in to rebound
1uezfusvyua_9-5-rgb_front so you have to understand who is in your area and who is going to box out who
1ug52nvllva_0-5-rgb_front pose one of the twelve yoga poses in shivananda yoga is headstand sirsasana
1ug52nvllva_1-5-rgb_front and i am going to have jim here demonstrating the headstand
1ug52nvllva_10-5-rgb_front as long as you practice headstand always measure off
1ug52nvllva_11-5-rgb_front you want to get a good distance there
1ug52nvllva_12-5-rgb_front now bringing the hands forward
1ug52nvllva_13-5-rgb_front hold on hold on
1ug52nvllva_14-5-rgb_front coming forward
1ug52nvllva_15-5-rgb_front now without moving the elbows you bring the arms forward
1ug52nvllva_16-5-rgb_front make sure you do not let them come out and apart
1ug52nvllva_17-5-rgb_front because this is your base for your headstand
1ug52nvllva_18-5-rgb_front alright
1ug52nvllva_19-5-rgb_front now placing your spot on your head where you would balance a book onto the floor
1ug52nvllva_20-5-rgb_front now notice his fingers are not clinched
1ug52nvllva_21-5-rgb_front they are nicely relaxed and the thumbs are kind of braced on the back of the head
1ug52nvllva_22-5-rgb_front now go ahead and tuck your toes
1ug52nvllva_23-5-rgb_front straighten the legs out
1ug52nvllva_24-5-rgb_front slowly walk a little bit forward until you have a nice long spine
1ug52nvllva_25-5-rgb_front and just lift
1ug52nvllva_26-5-rgb_front see how he just lifts up the knees
1ug52nvllva_27-5-rgb_front try not to ever kick up into headstand
1ug52nvllva_28-5-rgb_front then slowly lifting up
1ug52nvllva_29-5-rgb_front beautiful
1ug52nvllva_2_3-5-rgb_front ok first and most important thing about headstand is you start and you end in child pose the last thing you want to do is kind of throw the blood up to the brain and then just kind of throw it back out
1ug52nvllva_30-5-rgb_front now if he is going to be pressing equally into his tripod pulling in through the belly giving yourself a nice base
1ug52nvllva_31-5-rgb_front keep pressing into your tripod
1ug52nvllva_32-5-rgb_front keeping pulling in through your belly
1ug52nvllva_33-5-rgb_front and you get a beautiful headstand
1ug52nvllva_34-5-rgb_front headstand is a very healthy pose to do for yourself
1ug52nvllva_35-5-rgb_front it relieves the cardiovascular system
1ug52nvllva_36-5-rgb_front think about all that little blood that takes longer to get to the heart
1ug52nvllva_37-5-rgb_front this way it is just slowly flowing down gently
1ug52nvllva_4-5-rgb_front so i am going to have him come into child pose first
1ug52nvllva_5-5-rgb_front relax take two nice deep breaths
1ug52nvllva_6-5-rgb_front find that nice calming center
1ug52nvllva_7-5-rgb_front the most important part about headstand is your base your tripod
1ug52nvllva_8-5-rgb_front so i am going to have him go ahead and push up to the elbows measuring off
1ug52nvllva_9-5-rgb_front very important
1upmmycfiwm_1-5-rgb_front in this clip you are going to see how to repair a combination
1upmmycfiwm_10-5-rgb_front at that point you can either use your lamp your ultraviolet lamp to cure it which i will do right now
1upmmycfiwm_11-5-rgb_front otherwise if you are outside and most repairs can be done outside on nice days you can just let the sun cure this
1upmmycfiwm_2-5-rgb_front okay we are going to start with repairing a combination break
1upmmycfiwm_3-5-rgb_front with all breaks you always want to start off with drilling in and opening that up so that you can do the repair
1upmmycfiwm_4-5-rgb_front after drilling in you want to tie into any of the fingers that are going every different way by tapping into it
1upmmycfiwm_5-5-rgb_front notice how that i am not tapping too hard just light taps that i loop around that break
1upmmycfiwm_6-5-rgb_front then the final part of the process is taking the bridge and injecting into the piston with this resin so that we can place this over the break suction it to the glass and apply our piston to the glass
1upmmycfiwm_7-5-rgb_front now the piston is the part that is going to most of the work
1upmmycfiwm_8-5-rgb_front after everything has gotten set up you want to make sure that the sunlight is not curing it and we are actually in a garage so we will be using an ultraviolet light a lamp
1upmmycfiwm_9-5-rgb_front what you will do is siphon the air out with a siphon process and go back to injection and you will do this process a couple of times until you have the break completely filled with resin
1uwz92txrla_0-5-rgb_front hi there i am tracy goodwin and i am the red sweater lady and today we are going to be talking about how to build a character
1uwz92txrla_1-5-rgb_front and this is primarily for actors but possibly for directors or anyone involved in humorous interpretation dramatic interpretation any uil events or maybe you are just having to learn some material for an acting class or a speech class
1uwz92txrla_10-5-rgb_front and that is what we are doing when we are taking on a character whether it is in a play or even for a grade in a classroom is we want to recreate or be a real character or just like a real person
1uwz92txrla_11-5-rgb_front so i want to talk to you today about all the things that you need to consider so that your character can be perceived as real and your character can be fully developed
1uwz92txrla_2-5-rgb_front there are some definite things that you want to do when you develop a character some very specific questions that you want to answer and some very specific things that you want to know about your character
1uwz92txrla_3-5-rgb_front and i am going to talk about those today and tell you exactly what you need to do to build a strong lifelike character because that is what we are really trying to do
1uwz92txrla_4-5-rgb_front we do certain things in life
1uwz92txrla_5-5-rgb_front we act a certain way
1uwz92txrla_6-5-rgb_front we have a certain background
1uwz92txrla_7-5-rgb_front we look a certain way
1uwz92txrla_8-5-rgb_front we speak a certain way
1uwz92txrla_9-5-rgb_front we walk a certain way
1uhvxt9ri7u_1-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to be talking about how to pick a topic for an interview
1uhvxt9ri7u_10-5-rgb_front that is what i mean by critique you have to have a topic ready to interview the subject about so that everything can move quickly
1uhvxt9ri7u_2-5-rgb_front if you are at a live sporting event and you are watching the game it is great to be there but you are working so you have to bring a note pad and take notes
1uhvxt9ri7u_3-5-rgb_front for instance if you are watching a professional football game you just do not want to say the score is to which is a weird score for a football game i know but you want to say wow tom brady thrown interceptions so far and the patriots are still playing well
1uhvxt9ri7u_4-5-rgb_front you want to be able to critique the game as you watch it so when you pick a topic you go into the locker room or where ever the interview session is you will pick your topic and follow that topic that is what you will be interviewing on
1uhvxt9ri7u_5-5-rgb_front so will kind of have your things planned out that way you do not get into the locker room or the interview area and you are bumbling around and you do not know what you are talking about
1uhvxt9ri7u_6-5-rgb_front a lot of times reporters who are unprepared allow all the other reporters at the interview session to ask questions and then they will just hold the mic
1uhvxt9ri7u_7-5-rgb_front there
1uhvxt9ri7u_8-5-rgb_front you can always tell who is prepared by who asks the most questions and who asks the fastest questions
1uhvxt9ri7u_9-5-rgb_front because like i said if you listen to the interviewee you know what he is talking about but if you come prepared to say well in the quarter you threw an interception what were you trying to do
1ull4-m-sh8_0-5-rgb_front ok so now in this clip we are going to talk about idling
1ull4-m-sh8_1-5-rgb_front i go back to your pole your friend whatever is going to hold you up while you are trying to do this
1ull4-m-sh8_10-5-rgb_front you do not really have to do that
1ull4-m-sh8_11-5-rgb_front it just keeps you it keeps you up straight you can not just and you can not just stay on your unicycle stationary
1ull4-m-sh8_12-5-rgb_front you have to be rocking back and forth to stay up
1ull4-m-sh8_13-5-rgb_front so that is the reason you idle
1ull4-m-sh8_14-5-rgb_front and this is after you practice idling for awhile holding onto something and then just keep all your weight on this foot and just let go and see how many you can do
1ull4-m-sh8_2-5-rgb_front as we said before you are going to start with the unicycle in front of you and the pedal at a kind of degree angle rock up on to it holding on
1ull4-m-sh8_3-5-rgb_front i am putting all my weight on to this pedal
1ull4-m-sh8_4-5-rgb_front find that other pedal
1ull4-m-sh8_5-5-rgb_front now when you have all the weight on this foot what you are going to do is just start rocking back and forth with your other foot
1ull4-m-sh8_6_7-5-rgb_front so i am leaning all my weight here and i am just pushing forward and backward with this foot and i do not really i have the pedals coming up probably around a degree angle
1ull4-m-sh8_8-5-rgb_front i do not really have them i do not when i am rocking on the idle i am having it from here to here pretty much
1ull4-m-sh8_9-5-rgb_front i am not coming up too high when i am idling
1uvj0mvropw_0-5-rgb_front our super hero is starting to really shape up
1uvj0mvropw_1-5-rgb_front but we have some additional effects you want to make sure we do before we are done with this initial black and white pencil drawing
1uvj0mvropw_10-5-rgb_front now we also have the other web sling fluid which he is just letting go of
1uvj0mvropw_11-5-rgb_front the skin is letting go of something so we have to make sure we draw that in here
1uvj0mvropw_12-5-rgb_front this is more of web slinging stuff
1uvj0mvropw_13-5-rgb_front let is put this in here
1uvj0mvropw_14-5-rgb_front it is material that loops around a lot
1uvj0mvropw_15-5-rgb_front it is very dynamic
1uvj0mvropw_16-5-rgb_front so now we basically go back through there and we just kind of scraggle around the edges
1uvj0mvropw_17-5-rgb_front see how i am kind of like going around like in little spirals all the way around it all the way to the top
1uvj0mvropw_18-5-rgb_front now come down in some thick lines thick tapering lines
1uvj0mvropw_19-5-rgb_front because this is supposed to be more of a rope like substance
1uvj0mvropw_2-5-rgb_front and that is first off there is some of the other things going on in this
1uvj0mvropw_20-5-rgb_front and there you go now you have your web slinging fluid back behind there
1uvj0mvropw_21-5-rgb_front the last thing is kind of a bit of a background
1uvj0mvropw_22-5-rgb_front right now our hero is on a white ocean
1uvj0mvropw_23-5-rgb_front and let is draw in some other lines back in here
1uvj0mvropw_24-5-rgb_front you should show some dynamic flow
1uvj0mvropw_25-5-rgb_front and down around here diagonally kind of show a little more a little more dynamic a little more action just right in here going all across the page
1uvj0mvropw_26-5-rgb_front it makes it a little more interesting
1uvj0mvropw_27-5-rgb_front let is make it snowing behind him
1uvj0mvropw_28-5-rgb_front so a couple of circles randomly placed different shapes and sizes all flaking our hero
1uvj0mvropw_29-5-rgb_front and at this point you have completed your friendly neighborhood spiderman slinging home on a very very cold winter afternoon perhaps on his way to a family gathering or hopefully someplace else nice and warm and give him a break from fighting all that crime
1uvj0mvropw_3-5-rgb_front first off spiderman he is suspended in the air
1uvj0mvropw_4_5_6-5-rgb_front where is he is going he is web slinging which means you have to make sure you have the web sling out two lines drawn straight out and then basically draw a bunch of spirals the first time through
1uvj0mvropw_7-5-rgb_front now draw more lines coming out just like so
1uvj0mvropw_8-5-rgb_front and then i go back here and i draw one more line of spirals at a slightly different angle
1uvj0mvropw_9-5-rgb_front there you go you have web sling fluid
1uvxqsvkq3o_0-5-rgb_front with my little sister ashley
1uvxqsvkq3o_1-5-rgb_front so we are on section three and as you can see when i go back i actually may start to do this over
1uvxqsvkq3o_10-5-rgb_front with that under one i am going to add some more hair and switch hands
1uvxqsvkq3o_11-5-rgb_front bring the top one under and what am i going to do with it
1uvxqsvkq3o_12-5-rgb_front add some hair
1uvxqsvkq3o_13-5-rgb_front switch the sides so grab it with your hand
1uvxqsvkq3o_14-5-rgb_front what are the next fingers that grab
1uvxqsvkq3o_15-5-rgb_front it is the one that just went under top then under
1uvxqsvkq3o_16-5-rgb_front okay grab some more hair add it to the bottom one switch sides put that one in your hand
1uvxqsvkq3o_17-5-rgb_front where does this top one go
1uvxqsvkq3o_18-5-rgb_front it goes right here and then this one goes on the bottom
1uvxqsvkq3o_19-5-rgb_front okay what am i going to do next
1uvxqsvkq3o_2-5-rgb_front i told you earlier that it was a little loose as you can see that hair is a little bit loose
1uvxqsvkq3o_20-5-rgb_front grab some more hair and that process just goes over if you will see and over and over again okay
1uvxqsvkq3o_21-5-rgb_front grab it with your hand
1uvxqsvkq3o_22-5-rgb_front the next one and then the next one just like that
1uvxqsvkq3o_3-5-rgb_front so depending upon how long you want the hair to last you may want to redo that if it look loose like that
1uvxqsvkq3o_4-5-rgb_front okay so i have i am still doing the same technique i am doing a crossover like that but while you were away i kind of switched my hands a little bit there is other techniques that i will not show you right now but alright so my hand is holding my middle finger my pointer finger is holding the bottom one
1uvxqsvkq3o_5-5-rgb_front i have got my pointer finger and my thumb holding another and i have got basically my fingers back here holding on to with my hand the third tuft
1uvxqsvkq3o_6-5-rgb_front so in one hand i have got three tufts of hair right here
1uvxqsvkq3o_7-5-rgb_front now with my other hand what am i going to do
1uvxqsvkq3o_8-5-rgb_front i am going to grab some more hair and i am going to put it underneath on the lower one and then cross over bring this under
1uvxqsvkq3o_9-5-rgb_front that is that difference between a cornrow and french braid is you bring it under
1v7ct19bmbe_0_1-3-rgb_front so let is talk abut pest management in the hoophouse thankfully there are not as many pest pressures or disease pressures in the hoophouse and that is largely because of the nice dry environment the diseases the plagues the lights the fungal infection they just do not attack plants when their nice and hygienic and dry on top
1v7ct19bmbe_10-3-rgb_front so we really do not have to resort to some noxious poison or chemicals product
1v7ct19bmbe_11-3-rgb_front the other goal with integrated pest management is to interrupt the cycle of the pest so sometimes in the middle of the winter i will open up in here and let some nice cold air in because the plants can handle it but some of the pests will be killed and sometimes we will also introduce beneficial organisms
1v7ct19bmbe_12-3-rgb_front for instance by growing alliums and onions and leeks when they go to seed in the next couple of weeks their flowers attract many beneficial organisms which actually come into the hoophouse and dispense with the pest
1v7ct19bmbe_2-3-rgb_front so that is the first good news the bad news is you still do get pest
1v7ct19bmbe_3-3-rgb_front we get aphids we will get some different kinds of worms that make their way in here but the flee beatle is the potato beatle is the kinds of pest that ravage the outdoor crops they seem to be inhibited by the by the barrier even with the windows open and the doors open they seem to not get so well into the hoophouse
1v7ct19bmbe_4-3-rgb_front so as far as our pest management policy we generally use something called integrated pest management
1v7ct19bmbe_5-3-rgb_front and that is jargon for whatever works without using poison
1v7ct19bmbe_6-3-rgb_front we do not resort to poisons and occasionally we will lose some crops to various pest but generally if food crops are kept healthy if they are robust and growing strongly they resist almost all diseases and pest
1v7ct19bmbe_7-3-rgb_front so that is the first goal is prevention
1v7ct19bmbe_8-3-rgb_front once we have pests you can see here is a perfect example we have a little aphid infestation on the leaves of this heirloom broccoli now that is an ugly site there but i know that it is not going to take down this broccoli it is only going to inhibit it is growth a little bit
1v7ct19bmbe_9-3-rgb_front if we can get this broccoli this big then it will laugh at those aphids
1vhodmdprbo_1-5-rgb_front i am with the kelly white team and today we are going to tell you how to buy a house
1vhodmdprbo_10-5-rgb_front i am taking my time
1vhodmdprbo_11-5-rgb_front i am spending my dollars i am spending my hours finding you your perfect home
1vhodmdprbo_12-5-rgb_front all this is saying is that you are going to be respectful of our relationship and not stray
1vhodmdprbo_13-5-rgb_front do not you stray that is all it is saying
1vhodmdprbo_14-5-rgb_front and it does not cost you anything
1vhodmdprbo_15-5-rgb_front it is not a contract
1vhodmdprbo_16-5-rgb_front it is legally binding but it is all spelled out
1vhodmdprbo_17-5-rgb_front all it is saying its just a loyalty agreement
1vhodmdprbo_18-5-rgb_front it is saying you are going to respect me as a real estate professional sign it
1vhodmdprbo_2-5-rgb_front okay now i am going to talk about the exclusive agreement
1vhodmdprbo_3-5-rgb_front that is a big fancy word for loyalty agreement
1vhodmdprbo_4-5-rgb_front what is going to happen sometimes in most cases your realtor is going to ask you to sign this
1vhodmdprbo_5-5-rgb_front do not be afraid
1vhodmdprbo_6-5-rgb_front all it is saying is saying that you are going to be loyal to me
1vhodmdprbo_7-5-rgb_front i am going to show you these houses you are going to use me you are not going to call other realtors
1vhodmdprbo_8-5-rgb_front if you are interested in another property you are going to call me to show it to you
1vhodmdprbo_9-5-rgb_front all it is it is saying i as a realtor am trusting you
1vqzlvupngo_0-5-rgb_front hi
1vqzlvupngo_10-5-rgb_front the base line for my compost starts in the compost pile
1vqzlvupngo_11-5-rgb_front where i finish it up as here in my compost crumblier
1vqzlvupngo_12-5-rgb_front this allows me to turn compost over a lot quicker then it would take if i just left things in the pile
1vqzlvupngo_13-5-rgb_front now the things to look for when you make your compost is that nice dark black color that lets you know that you are really breaking things down in to good organic matter
1vqzlvupngo_14-5-rgb_front do not worry if things do not finish off completely
1vqzlvupngo_15-5-rgb_front the worms and the microbes in the soil would help finish that off for you
1vqzlvupngo_16-5-rgb_front some great ways to use this compost in the garden is to actually till it as a amendment and work into your soil but what i have done over the years and part of the reason i have such a nice loose soil is simply to use this in the garden as a mulch and as i plant new plants i simply come in mulch around it with a little bit of compost
1vqzlvupngo_17-5-rgb_front this helps preserve moisture in the soil it helps add the microbe organism that are necessary to release the natural food sources in the soil and in the compost that i just added and it is the base line for good organic gardening
1vqzlvupngo_18-5-rgb_front if you do not have a compost heap in your yard a compost tumbler is a great place to start but certainly there is room in everybody is yard to make your own compost
1vqzlvupngo_2-5-rgb_front hi
1vqzlvupngo_3-5-rgb_front i like to talk for a little while about compost in the garden
1vqzlvupngo_4-5-rgb_front i am a organic gardener so compost in my garden is probably the most important key for behaving good soil structure humus in the soil that is later going to turn in to the food to my plants
1vqzlvupngo_5-5-rgb_front now compost could come in any number of different ways you could get it bagged pelleted from a commercial sources but my favorite way is to make a my own compost
1vqzlvupngo_6-5-rgb_front now my compost does not finish up quiet as nice as some of those commercial products but it uses things on hand in my yard and it turns them onto the soil and you could see here that i have in my soil well there is little bits of leaves twigs pine needles and over the years of adding these to my soil it helps really build up nice
1vqzlvupngo_7-5-rgb_front you could see i could just dig in my soil with my hands
1vqzlvupngo_8-5-rgb_front i could dig down almost a foot bare handed
1vqzlvupngo_9-5-rgb_front it is nice loose soil but my plants really appreciate
1vbiazitnoe_0-5-rgb_front now in this segment we are going to learn the ten second and five second countdown cues for a news anchor
1vbiazitnoe_1-5-rgb_front now generally when you give your cues you are going to want to be pretty close to the front of the prompter
1vbiazitnoe_10-5-rgb_front then when they come and then when four comes you go four and then three and then two and one
1vbiazitnoe_11-5-rgb_front now you do not say that if they are talking
1vbiazitnoe_12_13-5-rgb_front if you say that and they are talking of course you are going to go over air you are going to sound kind of stupid
1vbiazitnoe_14-5-rgb_front they are going to be a little mad at you
1vbiazitnoe_15-5-rgb_front your director is going to be a little mad at you
1vbiazitnoe_16-5-rgb_front but it does happen
1vbiazitnoe_17_18-5-rgb_front now when you are coming out of the sound byte or commercial it is ok to give a verbal countdown so say you are coming down from five seconds you want to say five and also do the hand movements
1vbiazitnoe_19_20-5-rgb_front so you go five four three but you do not say two or one and then of course you always give your cue at the end that way they know ok they are coming on they are going to be there they are going to be talking
1vbiazitnoe_2-5-rgb_front this one is a little bit different than other ones because as in your thirty second cue you want to be on the side of it
1vbiazitnoe_21-5-rgb_front but of course you do not say two or one just in case something happens to where you come back early from it or a mic gets turned on something like that
1vbiazitnoe_22-5-rgb_front you never ever want to get caught on air talking or moving your hands in front of the camera or hitting the camera anything like that
1vbiazitnoe_23-5-rgb_front you want to be as discreet as possible
1vbiazitnoe_24-5-rgb_front you do not want people to even know that you are there
1vbiazitnoe_3-5-rgb_front and your fifteen you kind of want to be on the side of it
1vbiazitnoe_4-5-rgb_front but your ten second cue you can also be on the side of it
1vbiazitnoe_5-5-rgb_front some anchors usually you know this is pretty much the universal seconds two hands all five fingers up
1vbiazitnoe_6-5-rgb_front so you usually want to have it like that
1vbiazitnoe_7-5-rgb_front hold it up there for about two or three seconds
1vbiazitnoe_8-5-rgb_front then you can take it away
1vbiazitnoe_9-5-rgb_front now when you get to five seconds you want to have your hand up all five fingers
1ve6jgdkdry_0-5-rgb_front so what do you wear for performing for belly dancing
1ve6jgdkdry_1-5-rgb_front hi i am johanna kryntyzky from hip expressions belly dance studio in st petersburg florida
1ve6jgdkdry_10-5-rgb_front it is very traditional to have lots of fringe in the turkish style costumes
1ve6jgdkdry_11-5-rgb_front so we are looking at seeing a stream lined look and we are also seeing a bit more of these cut outs that you will find
1ve6jgdkdry_12-5-rgb_front so they will be cut outs down the side of the leg
1ve6jgdkdry_13-5-rgb_front now always in belly dance costuming you want to consider your audience and you want it to be appropriate for your audience
1ve6jgdkdry_14-5-rgb_front so you want something that is fashionable and tasteful and looks great on you
1ve6jgdkdry_15-5-rgb_front i am johanna krynytzky with hip expressions belly dance studio helping you with the latest fashions in belly dance
1ve6jgdkdry_2-5-rgb_front let is talk about the latest fashions in belly dancing costuming
1ve6jgdkdry_3-5-rgb_front now you may be familiar with the traditional bra a and belt which usually goes on over a big full skirt
1ve6jgdkdry_4-5-rgb_front this style of costuming was very popular in the is when belly dancing first came to america and became very very popular in some of the greek and turkish night clubs
1ve6jgdkdry_5-5-rgb_front lately you are going to find some fashions coming out of egypt such as this
1ve6jgdkdry_6-5-rgb_front i got this from joe hurrah who is a fashion designer in miami
1ve6jgdkdry_7-5-rgb_front and what we have now is we are seeing more of these one skirt where there is no separate belt attached the bead work is actually on the skirt
1ve6jgdkdry_8-5-rgb_front so you will find that in the bras again very similar a little more clean cut
1ve6jgdkdry_9-5-rgb_front not so much fringe hanging down
1vmlo8xfzqe_0-5-rgb_front so we are going to focus on another area that compensates for this tense area in your back where the s curve is and it is in your shoulders so again we do not want to apply too much pressure so again what i am going to do is kind of put my finger on a cubital and kind of push away from the top of the shoulder blades
1vmlo8xfzqe_1-5-rgb_front i can count a lot of knots and tension in the shoulder blades
1vmlo8xfzqe_2-5-rgb_front we just want to push that part out just push it out
1vmlo8xfzqe_3-5-rgb_front get a nice reference point and base it in there and then push out from the shoulder
1vmlo8xfzqe_4-5-rgb_front it will feel really really good to stretch
1vmlo8xfzqe_5-5-rgb_front you are actually pressing on the knot but the pressure feels good and then the opposite side with a lot of pressure
1vmlo8xfzqe_6-5-rgb_front you really really want to put a lot of pressure on this side to take away from the tension
1vmlo8xfzqe_7-5-rgb_front next we are going to do a stretch
1vmlo8xfzqe_8-5-rgb_front we are going to stretch the actual scapula and stretch this all out so there is more movement in that area
1vofqi_zdau_0-5-rgb_front alright
1vofqi_zdau_1-5-rgb_front we have washed trimmed and are boiling our asparagus
1vofqi_zdau_2-5-rgb_front our rice has been covered and reduced and so we are going to start preparing for our rice here
1vofqi_zdau_3_4-5-rgb_front we are going to cut our cilantro so we are going to go through our cilantro and find any pieces like this and just move them off to the side and then once we have done that and try and bunch them up like we did the asparagus with the leaves up at the top and the stems down on the bottom and then we can take that and simply cut the stems off and discard those
1vofqi_zdau_5-5-rgb_front with the middle of our knife we are just going to go along and chop our cilantro and once the leaves have more or less been broken up we are going to put our hand not at the end of the knife but close to it to hold it steady and we are going to use the back part of our knife because this is generally the sharpest part of the knife
1vofqi_zdau_6-5-rgb_front it is used the least
1vofqi_zdau_7-5-rgb_front and whenever you want to cut herbs this is the quickest and quietest way to do so
1vofqi_zdau_8-5-rgb_front so go ahead and cut this until all of the big leaves have been cut
1vq_uqeckf8_0-8-rgb_front okay in this clip we are going to i am going to show you how to portion the fish
1vq_uqeckf8_1-8-rgb_front this is a lot of fish
1vq_uqeckf8_10-8-rgb_front so what usually happens is they are going to take a relatively smaller section off the tail
1vq_uqeckf8_11-8-rgb_front and you are going to get about a six to eight ounce portion maybe is a good serving for someone
1vq_uqeckf8_12-8-rgb_front and that s a pretty pretty uniform thickness
1vq_uqeckf8_13-8-rgb_front a little tapered off in the tail but it is a pretty uniform thickness
1vq_uqeckf8_14-8-rgb_front that will be one serving
1vq_uqeckf8_15-8-rgb_front what i always like to do is cut down the middle of the fish to basically split the rest of the filet in half
1vq_uqeckf8_16-8-rgb_front you can see it is pretty thick there is about a good inch and a half thick
1vq_uqeckf8_17-8-rgb_front a lot of chefs are going to butterfly this open in some direction where you can still have a thinner piece of fish and they can get more out of their servings that way
1vq_uqeckf8_18-8-rgb_front okay
1vq_uqeckf8_19-8-rgb_front now you basically have twice as much fish half as thick
1vq_uqeckf8_2-8-rgb_front this filet probably weighs about three pounds
1vq_uqeckf8_20-8-rgb_front and you know could cut that in half and these would be two more portions
1vq_uqeckf8_21-8-rgb_front and this is not by any means exactly accurate the way you are going to get it
1vq_uqeckf8_22-8-rgb_front a thicker filet once again i am going to cut it straight down
1vq_uqeckf8_23-8-rgb_front very thick filet hard to cook evenly
1vq_uqeckf8_24-8-rgb_front we are going to try to just cut this butterfly this open to get two filets out of this
1vq_uqeckf8_25-8-rgb_front two more filets
1vq_uqeckf8_26-8-rgb_front okay
1vq_uqeckf8_27-8-rgb_front do the same thing in the head area
1vq_uqeckf8_28-8-rgb_front and you do not really want to waste anything because this fish is not cheap
1vq_uqeckf8_29-8-rgb_front natural resources getting harder and harder to come by
1vq_uqeckf8_3-8-rgb_front okay
1vq_uqeckf8_30-8-rgb_front so we are going to leave as much fish on here and throw as little away as we can
1vq_uqeckf8_31-8-rgb_front we want to sell this whole fish
1vq_uqeckf8_32-8-rgb_front we want to eat this whole fish
1vq_uqeckf8_33-8-rgb_front and now we have two more filets
1vq_uqeckf8_34-8-rgb_front so out of one side i believe i got six filets six portions
1vq_uqeckf8_4-8-rgb_front you can not eat that much fish
1vq_uqeckf8_5-8-rgb_front one person will not be served this much fish
1vq_uqeckf8_6-8-rgb_front so we are going to take the fish and we are going to cut it into what i would consider equal portions
1vq_uqeckf8_7-8-rgb_front maybe what a chef would do in a restaurant and that is how they would serve it to you
1vq_uqeckf8_8-8-rgb_front okay the fish is not even as far as thickness
1vq_uqeckf8_9-8-rgb_front you have got the tail portion the head portion and you have the thickness mainly in the middle
1vrnikyrfo0_0-5-rgb_front we are back we are going to be steaming broccoli today and before i do that i am going to give you some tips on buying vegetables
1vrnikyrfo0_1-5-rgb_front the first tip you want to get is get friends with your produce guy cause he is your buddy
1vrnikyrfo0_2-5-rgb_front he is going to teach you how to pick the right ones
1vrnikyrfo0_3-5-rgb_front in looking for vegetables you want to look for the greenest possible a little yellow is okay and then i have a certain test that i like to do it is called the finger test
1vrnikyrfo0_4-5-rgb_front a little firmest goes a long way
1vrnikyrfo0_5-5-rgb_front a like the florescences because it is already done the work is all taking away for you
1vrnikyrfo0_6-5-rgb_front you may have to trim off a little bit of brown on there but that is about it
1vrnikyrfo0_7-5-rgb_front the reason i chose broccoli today is because broccoli is very good for antioxidants it has a lot of calcium and there is just a lot of flavor in it
1vrnikyrfo0_8-5-rgb_front the next step we will move onto is cleaning you vegetables
1vxwre210oc_0-5-rgb_front this upper body tubing exercise is called the shoulder front raise
1vxwre210oc_1-5-rgb_front take your tubing which should be about light to medium resistance place it down on the floor and step one foot into the tubing
1vxwre210oc_10-5-rgb_front always make sure that you have your abdominal muscle engaged and that will protect your back
1vxwre210oc_11-5-rgb_front we are going to have great looking shoulders out there as we put those tank tops on getting ready for the beach that is for sure
1vxwre210oc_12-5-rgb_front and that is the shoulder front raise exercise using the tubing
1vxwre210oc_2-5-rgb_front and the tubing should be right underneath the arch of your foot
1vxwre210oc_3-5-rgb_front start off by simply raising one arm at a time
1vxwre210oc_4-5-rgb_front as you are doing the shoulder raise make sure that you just lift your arm right to shoulder height
1vxwre210oc_5-5-rgb_front you do not want to go any higher
1vxwre210oc_6-5-rgb_front we do not want any problems with those shoulder joints
1vxwre210oc_7-5-rgb_front and exhale as you lift inhale as you lower
1vxwre210oc_8-5-rgb_front now if you want to make it a little more challenging go both arms at the same time
1vxwre210oc_9-5-rgb_front lift up and lower down
1w4yoknwuty_0-5-rgb_front standing side flexions with the weights by side
1w4yoknwuty_1-5-rgb_front an exercise for an area right here in the middle section of your body
1w4yoknwuty_10-5-rgb_front and you see that this alignment right here
1w4yoknwuty_11-5-rgb_front so you want to keep the line going up all the way to the crown of the head
1w4yoknwuty_12-5-rgb_front exhale
1w4yoknwuty_13-5-rgb_front inhale
1w4yoknwuty_14-5-rgb_front exhale
1w4yoknwuty_15-5-rgb_front do a few make sure you do same number on one side and the other and you will have good looking core before you know it
1w4yoknwuty_16-5-rgb_front see you soon
1w4yoknwuty_2-5-rgb_front you are going to stand up tall and i want to show you from the side that your hips are going to be tucked in and your belly is going to be in
1w4yoknwuty_3-5-rgb_front without letting the shoulders hump like this
1w4yoknwuty_4-5-rgb_front so you really want to keep it tall and just like if you are looking into your zipper right here you are going to tuck those hips
1w4yoknwuty_5-5-rgb_front okay your knees are going to be slightly bent as you do that
1w4yoknwuty_6-5-rgb_front so when you keep your weights by the side make sure that you are also keeping your chest tall by squeezing your back muscles bringing the shoulders down by using the back
1w4yoknwuty_7-5-rgb_front keeping your feet under your hips parallel bending the knees a little bit with the tuck in vacuuming your tummy
1w4yoknwuty_8-5-rgb_front you are going to take an inhale and reach with the weight exhale coming up
1w4yoknwuty_9-5-rgb_front make sure that your head follows the line of the spine meaning the head is going to want to do this
1wgejpkd8ns_0-5-rgb_front in this segment we are going to talk about how to do gum massage on your dog
1wgejpkd8ns_1-5-rgb_front the younger the dog is the easier it is to get them used to having your fingers into their mouths
1wgejpkd8ns_10-5-rgb_front if you do five seconds today maybe tomorrow you can get ten seconds
1wgejpkd8ns_11-5-rgb_front and every day that you get your fingers into your dog is mouth they are going to tolerate it a little more
1wgejpkd8ns_12-5-rgb_front and if you start as puppies they are really going to be used to it and not push you out
1wgejpkd8ns_2-5-rgb_front and it is very important to massage their gums as important as it to brush their teeth
1wgejpkd8ns_3-5-rgb_front and by massaging their gums you are moving the circulation keeping their gums healthy
1wgejpkd8ns_4-5-rgb_front so you can just start on one side and do small circles all the way around their gums
1wgejpkd8ns_5-5-rgb_front and they will lick and they may try and get your fingers out of there and you just have to keep at it and get them used to it
1wgejpkd8ns_6-5-rgb_front yes
1wgejpkd8ns_7-5-rgb_front sometimes you can use a little bit of doggy toothpaste in a flavor that they like and help them get used to licking your fingers and liking your fingers in their mouth
1wgejpkd8ns_8-5-rgb_front and small circles are the best and all the way around making sure to get both the top and the bottom
1wgejpkd8ns_9-5-rgb_front and you do not have to spend a lot of time doing this
1wizh2vgoje_0-5-rgb_front this intermediate pilates exercise is called the double straight leg stretch and this is the fourth exercise part of the five ab series in pilates so we really are going to focus really on those abdominal muscles
1wizh2vgoje_1-5-rgb_front so some on down lengthen your legs straight up
1wizh2vgoje_10-5-rgb_front if you have back issues and you want to modify this exercise you can place your hands right up up up underneath your hips and lower your legs down and lift up
1wizh2vgoje_11_12-5-rgb_front and you want to think about placing the lower part of your head onto the mat and you want to perform that exercise anywhere between eight to ten reps that is the double straight leg stretch
1wizh2vgoje_2-5-rgb_front your head and shoulders are lifted off the mat
1wizh2vgoje_3-5-rgb_front place your hands gently behind your head
1wizh2vgoje_4-5-rgb_front try not to pull on your neck
1wizh2vgoje_5-5-rgb_front and your legs are in a pilates stance meaning that your heels are together and your toes are out like a v pointing your toes
1wizh2vgoje_6-5-rgb_front squeeze your inner thighs
1wizh2vgoje_7-5-rgb_front as you lower your legs down inhale and then exhale as you lift your legs back up
1wizh2vgoje_8-5-rgb_front now your focus here is to keep the lower back pressing to the mat
1wizh2vgoje_9-5-rgb_front inhale as you lower and exhale as you come up
1wutv5ttnjg_0-5-rgb_front hi
1wutv5ttnjg_1-5-rgb_front i am jk dooley and we are talking today about giclee reproductions and we are going to touch a little bit now about selecting what you want to print on
1wutv5ttnjg_2-5-rgb_front paper is obviously a choice and there is a lot of different kinds of paper that you can choose from and some are really good depending on what you are printing
1wutv5ttnjg_3-5-rgb_front so as an example a really slick type of paper like this would be appropriate to print a photograph on if you were going to do photographic reproduction
1wutv5ttnjg_4-5-rgb_front it picks the picks the image up really nicely and then you have paper like this that is a little rougher that would be really appropriate say for a pastel image or even obviously a watercolor
1wutv5ttnjg_5-5-rgb_front this is a watercolor paper
1wutv5ttnjg_6-5-rgb_front some papers are really very good for a canvas piece and if you do not want to print on canvas but you have a canvas piece that you would like to reproduce you can obviously do that on paper and there is papers that are more suitable for that too
1wutv5ttnjg_7-5-rgb_front so it is really a personal preference
1wutv5ttnjg_8-5-rgb_front there is a lot of different kinds to choose from so i would suggest going out there and looking around and just seeing what is available
1wwrpyzxtnu_0-5-rgb_front so next we are going to add some lip color to sherry
1wwrpyzxtnu_1-5-rgb_front so rather than using a full lipstick especially for spring makeup i do not really think that you need it so i am actually going to use a stain on sherry
1wwrpyzxtnu_2-5-rgb_front so i am just going to use my ring finger and i am just going to start to kind of dab this right on her lip and you can see it automatically gives color but because it is a stain it is going to stay all day
1wwrpyzxtnu_3-5-rgb_front and this is more of like this kind of hot and it sort of gives that bee stung look
1wwrpyzxtnu_4-5-rgb_front it is really really pretty and you can see how pretty it is with that purple that we have on her lids
1wwrpyzxtnu_5-5-rgb_front so i am just going to blend this in really lightly
1wwrpyzxtnu_6-5-rgb_front i am not going to do a ton cause she really does not need it
1wwrpyzxtnu_7-5-rgb_front you definitely can use a lip brush if you want to but you do not have to
1wwrpyzxtnu_8-5-rgb_front you can also use a lip liner if you feel like you need a little bit more definition i definitely understand that
1wwrpyzxtnu_9-5-rgb_front sherry does not necessarily need it so we are going to skip the liner with this today but and using a brush to put on this stain is going to give you a lot more color but i just sort of want to give the bee sting look so i am just going to pat it right on her lip and leave it at that
1wzgaibhaps_0-5-rgb_front okay so the last exercise i am going to show you is for the lower back
1wzgaibhaps_1-5-rgb_front really important place to work and a lot of people forget to do it or just do not feel like doing it because it is not one of those things that they are always looking at in the mirror but it is so important
1wzgaibhaps_10-5-rgb_front i would do times on each side and then you are going to make it a little bit tougher you are going lift hold and then try without moving your body pull the elbow into the knee without moving the rest of your body you can move the elbow and knee and then bring it right back out again and then switch
1wzgaibhaps_11-5-rgb_front this just adds a little dimension to it
1wzgaibhaps_12-5-rgb_front pulling in makes it just a tiny bit tougher out and drop and again
1wzgaibhaps_13-5-rgb_front i try to get my clients to do about to reps on each side hold it seconds and down
1wzgaibhaps_14-5-rgb_front i always end them with cat stretches
1wzgaibhaps_15-5-rgb_front which i am sure you have seen but you want to make sure you do right
1wzgaibhaps_16-5-rgb_front so you are just going to drop and then just like a cat when it gets scared you just round out your back
1wzgaibhaps_17-5-rgb_front i see a lot of people who kind of do stuff with their upper body that is not how it is you want to keep your shoulders nice and low straighten out round out exhale get it all out and then drop and flatten it out again like you are a table and then pull in
1wzgaibhaps_18-5-rgb_front exhale as you pull in and drop
1wzgaibhaps_19-5-rgb_front that should be a really relaxing exercise and really relaxing way to kind of finish off your workout
1wzgaibhaps_2-5-rgb_front especially as you get older and you kind of start to hunch over if your abdominals and lower back are not strong
1wzgaibhaps_20-5-rgb_front make sure that you keep that breathing going and just let it go and then just give yourself a hand for doing such a good job
1wzgaibhaps_22-5-rgb_front we have did a whole bunch of exercises that do not require anything but your body and you can do them anywhere
1wzgaibhaps_23-5-rgb_front i hope that you had a good time and remember you want to keep good form keep the abdominals working at all time and you can always email me at heatherrider com if you have any questions
1wzgaibhaps_24-5-rgb_front nothing should hurt your knees should not hurt your back should not hurt you should just feel good and worked out after this workout
1wzgaibhaps_25-5-rgb_front hope you had fun
1wzgaibhaps_3-5-rgb_front so i am going to show you some exercises that you may already know but in progression
1wzgaibhaps_4-5-rgb_front so this is just called a quadruped
1wzgaibhaps_5-5-rgb_front making sure that your body is nice and straight and that your shoulders watch out for the tent shoulders dropping
1wzgaibhaps_6-5-rgb_front so all you are going to do is extend that right arm and if you are able to extend the left leg or just the opposite leg and arm and just hold it for about to seconds and then slowly come down and switch
1wzgaibhaps_7-5-rgb_front the big mistake i see people make here is they kind of wiggle around and they kind of lift too high and then they drop it down
1wzgaibhaps_8-5-rgb_front everything needs to be done very slowly and deliberately
1wzgaibhaps_9-5-rgb_front lift and lower
1xe5ltnrkwk_0_1-5-rgb_front this is a spanish oak tree that grows well in texas they can get quite large up to feet and get quite big enough where it takes couple of men to get around
1xe5ltnrkwk_2-5-rgb_front they are native in the creek bottoms and areas where you can get a little water not so much anymore in the areas of texas
1xe5ltnrkwk_3-5-rgb_front the tree is quite well adapted and it makes a good shade tree as you can see from this one
1xe5ltnrkwk_4-5-rgb_front it makes a high shade canopy and it is not susceptible to a lot of diseases that the other oaks are susceptible to
1xe5ltnrkwk_5-5-rgb_front they are well known in texas as a yard shaped tree
1xmjj7b4vjo_0-3-rgb_front hi my name is michelle and i am a dental assistant with solutionz and i am going to explain to you on how to gargle with mouth rinse
1xmjj7b4vjo_1-3-rgb_front pretty much what you want to do initially is get the mouth rinse read the directions on the back to figure out as far as the measurements on how much you should rinse with
1xmjj7b4vjo_2-3-rgb_front and then pretty much follow the directions
1xmjj7b4vjo_3-3-rgb_front so in this case we are going to pour half a cap full of the rinse
1xmjj7b4vjo_4-3-rgb_front you are going to place it in your mouth
1xmjj7b4vjo_5-3-rgb_front swiss it around to get it started and then tilt your head back and force air through your throat which in return will cause the gargling effect
1xmjj7b4vjo_6-3-rgb_front ok here i go
1xmjj7b4vjo_7-3-rgb_front and once again my name is michelle and i just showed you how to use mouth rinse to gargle
1xouwr5cp6o_0-5-rgb_front with your damp book up on edge with all of the pages fanned out it s just as important now as with your saturated book to have good air flow
1xouwr5cp6o_1-5-rgb_front so once again i am going to turn the air filter on
1xouwr5cp6o_10-5-rgb_front so you always want to have your book up on end spread out for it to dry
1xouwr5cp6o_11-5-rgb_front one thing to remember though is that once you have it out on end you do not need to check nearly as frequently with your damp book as you do with your saturated or partially wet book
1xouwr5cp6o_12-5-rgb_front because for the most part is fairly dry
1xouwr5cp6o_13-5-rgb_front however you do need to come and flip the book once in a while
1xouwr5cp6o_14-5-rgb_front this is to ensure that the pages because they will be pulling just a little away from the spine
1xouwr5cp6o_15-5-rgb_front are not going to pull away entirely in one direction
1xouwr5cp6o_16-5-rgb_front so as long as you keep flipping the book then you are going to have much more even drying
1xouwr5cp6o_17-5-rgb_front and this way it also ensures that the tops and bottoms of the pages are not drying at a much slower pace than the rest of it
1xouwr5cp6o_18-5-rgb_front because they are against the bottom of your table
1xouwr5cp6o_2-5-rgb_front of course you can use an oscillating fan
1xouwr5cp6o_3-5-rgb_front it is important for you to have if it s a fan for the air to be moving constantly and not just blowing directly on the book
1xouwr5cp6o_4-5-rgb_front unless the fan is across the room
1xouwr5cp6o_5-5-rgb_front because otherwise you could end up damaging the pages by bending them perhaps with the flow of air if it s too strong
1xouwr5cp6o_6-5-rgb_front so like the air filter it s a much lower speed of air that coming through
1xouwr5cp6o_7-5-rgb_front one thing that is very important to remember is you never ever want to have your book on its covers like this
1xouwr5cp6o_8-5-rgb_front this is not going to do any good for your book its going to pull it away from the spine here
1xouwr5cp6o_9-5-rgb_front and it s also going to damage the pages because they are going to be flattened on the edges where they have been presses against the table
1xvft7xyk00_0-5-rgb_front a really great way to get a good back stretch as well as to get a chest opener is with an easy seated pose with a fish pose so gina and i are just going to come back to back and we are just going to sit in an easy seated pose
1xvft7xyk00_1-5-rgb_front that means your feet are just comfortable and your knees are comfortable and out to the side
1xvft7xyk00_10-5-rgb_front inhaling coming back up and then it is always nice to end your session with a sun moon breath body length so inhale draw the arms up and exhale draw the energy into heart center
1xvft7xyk00_2-5-rgb_front we are going to press our shoulders together
1xvft7xyk00_3-5-rgb_front as we inhale gina is going to fold forward and just get a nice back stretch and lengthen through her spine and i am going to open my spine up opening my heart up to the sky and ready to receive energy
1xvft7xyk00_4-5-rgb_front we are going to inhale i am going to lift up and come forward and gina is going to open her chest now as i release through my spine good
1xvft7xyk00_5-5-rgb_front this feels really good and really nice to come into a rocking back and forth motion
1xvft7xyk00_6-5-rgb_front inhaling up and exhaling i am going to lean back as gina stretches through her spine
1xvft7xyk00_7-5-rgb_front make sure that you talk to your partner so it is not too much weight
1xvft7xyk00_8-5-rgb_front inhale are we okay gina
1xvft7xyk00_9-5-rgb_front good and exhale come forward or lean back whatever is the case depending on which side you are on
1xvcfj97qqs_1-8-rgb_front so the next step is we are going to come to the ironing board and we are going to mark our side seams
1xvcfj97qqs_10-8-rgb_front so we are going to roll this direction towards me so on the finished product you do not have one seam in and one seam out
1xvcfj97qqs_2-8-rgb_front and so the sides are the short pieces here
1xvcfj97qqs_3-8-rgb_front we are going to do a nice half inch roll and steaming it so it stays nice and firm because we do not want to have to come back and do that
1xvcfj97qqs_4-8-rgb_front the steam is going to help set the crease in the fabric so when you sew it you do not have to use pins as much
1xvcfj97qqs_5-8-rgb_front okay once you get the first half inch crease in you are going to go back to the top you should always press in the same direction
1xvcfj97qqs_6-8-rgb_front and when we are pressing we are actually pressing with the iron not sliding it
1xvcfj97qqs_7-8-rgb_front i will show you in just a second
1xvcfj97qqs_8-8-rgb_front now we are going to do a second crease and it is going to be a three quarter inch crease
1xvcfj97qqs_9-8-rgb_front so you are actually wanting to pick the iron up and press down on it not slide it and go to the other side and do same thing making sure that you have the rolls going both in the same side
1xj_2_6v1o0_1-8-rgb_front today i would be talking about how to tack up a horse
1xj_2_6v1o0_10-8-rgb_front once again it is important that the velcro is pulling towards the back
1xj_2_6v1o0_11-8-rgb_front place the cup behind the horses leg come to the front and then the velcro pulls towards the back
1xj_2_6v1o0_2-8-rgb_front so boots are important when you are going to jump your horse or just for basic protection of support
1xj_2_6v1o0_3-8-rgb_front i especially like to use boots on my horse when they have horse shoes on cause the metal of the shoes can be damaging if they trip or hit themselves on accident
1xj_2_6v1o0_4-8-rgb_front so we just have basic examples of boots for horses
1xj_2_6v1o0_5-8-rgb_front these are basic splint boots and you want to make sure that putting the boot on the padded area protects the inside of the horses leg where there are there ligaments are most like to be compromise
1xj_2_6v1o0_6-8-rgb_front the way that you put the boot on is that the velcro always comes towards the back and that is how you know you have it on the right leg
1xj_2_6v1o0_7-8-rgb_front it just comes down to the bottom of the fetlock not pasted the joint where it might interfere
1xj_2_6v1o0_8-8-rgb_front the second kind of boot is a open front boot
1xj_2_6v1o0_9-8-rgb_front this protects not only the sides but the back of the horses leg and the fitting is very similar
1xot1-gzwfg_0-8-rgb_front hi there
1xot1-gzwfg_1-8-rgb_front my name is larry omaha and i am a professional stand up comedian
1xot1-gzwfg_10-8-rgb_front but that is the only way you can become a comic and then grow in to becoming a full time professional comedian
1xot1-gzwfg_11-8-rgb_front there is no other way around it
1xot1-gzwfg_12-8-rgb_front there might be one person in a million who is born to be a comic and just got up on stage one day and was funny and never had to sweat never had to pay dues
1xot1-gzwfg_13-8-rgb_front but i doubt it
1xot1-gzwfg_14-8-rgb_front there is real no set education to become a comedian
1xot1-gzwfg_15-8-rgb_front the education most comics have is street
1xot1-gzwfg_16-8-rgb_front what they have learned in their life
1xot1-gzwfg_17-8-rgb_front education of living
1xot1-gzwfg_18-8-rgb_front you certainly do not need a college education to become a good comic
1xot1-gzwfg_19-8-rgb_front some of the greatest comedians that we have had never made it past high school
1xot1-gzwfg_2-8-rgb_front how does one become a comedian
1xot1-gzwfg_20-8-rgb_front on the other hand there are many great comics who did have a college education
1xot1-gzwfg_21-8-rgb_front everyone is going to be different
1xot1-gzwfg_22-8-rgb_front you do not have to go to a comedy school
1xot1-gzwfg_23-8-rgb_front some people do
1xot1-gzwfg_24-8-rgb_front it is not necessary
1xot1-gzwfg_25-8-rgb_front you do not have to get any kind of technical specific certificate or anything like that
1xot1-gzwfg_26-8-rgb_front it is really a learn on the job type of profession
1xot1-gzwfg_27-8-rgb_front the way most of us do it is by going out every night to clubs and wait to get on that stage
1xot1-gzwfg_28-8-rgb_front that stage time is really the most crucial thing to becoming a comic
1xot1-gzwfg_29-8-rgb_front without stage time you will never achieve you will never grow you will never become a really good professional stand up comedian
1xot1-gzwfg_3-8-rgb_front one creates a lot of material
1xot1-gzwfg_4-8-rgb_front memorizes that material rehearses it refines it performs it in front of strangers every night sometimes and becomes so good that people want to pay to see them
1xot1-gzwfg_5-8-rgb_front there is a lot more that goes on and involved with that
1xot1-gzwfg_6-8-rgb_front it takes years to develop this material
1xot1-gzwfg_7-8-rgb_front it takes years to develop what they call your persona to develop the kind of material that works for your persona
1xot1-gzwfg_8-8-rgb_front it involves going to open mikes
1xot1-gzwfg_9-8-rgb_front going to audition nights going to audition nights going to coffee houses going to comedy clubs on their off nights and getting up in front of small crowds sometimes two or three people and trying out that material
1xscsokf558_0-8-rgb_front now i will show you how to make the snout of our bear
1xscsokf558_1-8-rgb_front i have chosen a few pieces of the larger pieces of cake that we have cut out and you want to just chose a few that when you put them together will make a big enough piece for a snout and these are the pieces i have chose and i put them together like this and then you just want to trim and shape until you get sort of a snout shape
1xscsokf558_2-8-rgb_front now it does not have to be a perfect shape because the frosting will fill it out and give you the roundness that you want and then when you have it set you can put a little bit of icing in between as glue and then we will set that aside until we are ready to use it
1xscsokf558_3-8-rgb_front before frosting the cake you want to take your snout piece and just try it on your teddy bear make sure that it is a good size
1xscsokf558_4-8-rgb_front it is going to end up being slightly larger because when you ice it over it will give it a little more thickness
1xscsokf558_5-8-rgb_front but that looks that looks about right okay
1xscsokf558_6-8-rgb_front and if you want you can frost it ahead of time and then leave it on the plate until it is ready
1xscsokf558_7-8-rgb_front so this is what i would do is just take some frosting and just frost that snout all around and then will set that aside and then when the rest of the cake is frosted we can just lay it on and then we will trim it we will just go over it one more time once it is on the cake
1xscsokf558_8-8-rgb_front it is a little bit easier to frost the snout before it is placed on the cake and then we will just touch it up once it is on the cake
1xzuqbmjxk4_10-8-rgb_front and they tend to also do e is like that
1xzuqbmjxk4_11-8-rgb_front ok so that is the artistic form and now kind of an extension of that would be ornate very ornate kind of person
1xzuqbmjxk4_12-8-rgb_front and that is someone who they might be a little affected or they might be someone who really likes to show themselves as somewhat more than they are
1xzuqbmjxk4_13-8-rgb_front someone with lots of flourishes
1xzuqbmjxk4_14-8-rgb_front that kind of flourishy writing
1xzuqbmjxk4_15-8-rgb_front i am sure you know someone who writes like that
1xzuqbmjxk4_16-8-rgb_front and also lots of embellishments and stuff and they might also be putting lines under their writing
1xzuqbmjxk4_17-8-rgb_front as you can see we have seven distinct forms of writing and that is probably the first thing you will going to be looking at when you are looking at someone is writing is the overall form of it
1xzuqbmjxk4_1_2-8-rgb_front ok and now here is a writing which is someone who maybe is a little confused and again i am going to try and do it but this is someone who is kind of disorderly
1xzuqbmjxk4_3-8-rgb_front as you can see it is kind of all over the place
1xzuqbmjxk4_4-8-rgb_front there is lots of different types of form within it indicates maybe a lack of balance
1xzuqbmjxk4_5-8-rgb_front ok so that is what we call irregular
1xzuqbmjxk4_6-8-rgb_front now there is another type of form which we refer to as natural and simplified and this might be someone who tends to keep the letters separate keeps the letters separate and as you can see it is just very simple
1xzuqbmjxk4_7-8-rgb_front it is a simplified type of writing
1xzuqbmjxk4_8-8-rgb_front and that again is someone who they are not pretentious they do not have lots of flowery things they are just a very natural simple sort of person
1xzuqbmjxk4_9-8-rgb_front ok and now we have a form that we call artistic or creative and this is where they tend to kind of throw in little curly q is like if they were saying i am trying they might go a little circle for the dot as you can see this g which looks a bit like an eight that is a sign of artistic also
1y3ruxz7auw_0-8-rgb_front next we want to talk a little bit about worms and puppies
1y3ruxz7auw_1-8-rgb_front when your puppy was first born it might have actually been born with some worms because the mother passes them in the placenta and in the milk but it also could pick up some worms afterwards and so i wanted to go ahead and go over some of these different types of worms
1y3ruxz7auw_10-8-rgb_front the one that we like is called sentinel and sentinel is a really great product because it takes care of fleas intestinal parasites and also heartworm and so if you give to your puppy this once a month it will prevent your dog from having all of these parasites
1y3ruxz7auw_11-8-rgb_front now this particular product does not do anything for ticks and so you may have to do some other thing for ticks if you are finding ticks in your neighborhood or if you take your puppy out on a hike and you come back with ticks
1y3ruxz7auw_12-8-rgb_front ticks are more common in the wintertime in this area because they need a little bit of moisture and so if you are starting to pick up some ticks with your dog you can use a topical product that we can recommend or we have a really good tick collar that might help your dog from having these attached to him
1y3ruxz7auw_2-8-rgb_front if you get roundworms these are hookworms these are whipworms these are some actually flea eggs that your puppy can get we are going to talk about that as well
1y3ruxz7auw_3-8-rgb_front and these are actually heartworms and heartworms are another problem that we get with dogs
1y3ruxz7auw_4-8-rgb_front that is transmitted by a mosquito and your puppy would not be born with that but we are going to talk a little bit about products that we might want to use to keep your dog from getting these worms
1y3ruxz7auw_5-8-rgb_front and again roundworms are real common that they can get passed from their mother
1y3ruxz7auw_6-8-rgb_front in southern california we do not have a real problem with roundworms after they become adults because they have to pass out of the dog and embryonate for three or four days before they go onto another dog
1y3ruxz7auw_7-8-rgb_front and it is so dry in southern california that we do not have a big problem with those
1y3ruxz7auw_8-8-rgb_front we are seeing more and more problems with heartworm however and it is spreading all over the nation
1y3ruxz7auw_9-8-rgb_front and so it is one of those ones that you really want to prevent and to prevent it we have lots of different types of medications but it is an oral medication you are going to have to give your puppy every month
1y3zgxjshda_1-8-rgb_front in this video clip i will be showing you how to make a bevel or a radius
1y3zgxjshda_2-8-rgb_front on some projects you might want a bevel or a radius to give the edge a nice finished look
1y3zgxjshda_3-8-rgb_front using our planer to create a bevel we are going to hold our planer at an angle whatever angle we desire and we are going to make about or passes just bringing down that edge
1y3zgxjshda_4-8-rgb_front as you can see that has taken that down and it will have a nice finished appearance on that edge
1y3zgxjshda_5-8-rgb_front for a rounded edge we are going to make a series of cuts turning the planer as we go
1y3zgxjshda_6-8-rgb_front this is going to start to create that radius
1y3zgxjshda_7-8-rgb_front now you will probably want to come back and clean this up with a little bit of sandpaper
1yaa5_d-zg0_0-8-rgb_front okay in this clip we are going to be drawing hair on our queen and what we will do is we will start kind of like right along the edges here and she her hair is going to be very interesting
1yaa5_d-zg0_1-8-rgb_front we are going to make it very very full and very poofy
1yaa5_d-zg0_10-8-rgb_front as you can see the huge feather coming out of her head
1yaa5_d-zg0_11-8-rgb_front i come down the sides like this draw the stem a clearly defined stem coming up and that will be the top portion of our good queen is hair
1yaa5_d-zg0_12-8-rgb_front now what you want to do also is make sure there is a clear line defining where the feather begins and where the hair ends cause you do not want people confusing the two
1yaa5_d-zg0_13-8-rgb_front you want people to clearly see that that is a feather on top of our good queen is head
1yaa5_d-zg0_14-8-rgb_front do not draw too much detail in there because you do not want to you know you do not want to call too much attention to it even though it is like hard to ignore really
1yaa5_d-zg0_15-8-rgb_front it is sticking out of her head after all
1yaa5_d-zg0_16-8-rgb_front but yeah i would say we have a good start here and what we will do now is we will move on to the next portion and draw her shoulders
1yaa5_d-zg0_17-8-rgb_front so if you got the hair and the feather all set go ahead and move onto
1yaa5_d-zg0_2-8-rgb_front back then the the styles were that if you the richer you were and the more royal you were the more detailing got put into your your face and your hair and you knew that that woman was definitely royal if she had a very high high hairdo had it all up
1yaa5_d-zg0_3-8-rgb_front none of it down here nothing below the ears really just all up
1yaa5_d-zg0_4-8-rgb_front i mean if she wore her hair down that was either a sign that she was like so lower class type peasant or she was maybe a you know just younger like a princess or something like that but that once you reached a certain age you were never caught dead with your hair down and you can sort of have a little fun with her
1yaa5_d-zg0_5-8-rgb_front like make her at this point look like she is got like a big old afro
1yaa5_d-zg0_6-8-rgb_front and then what we will do is we are going to really have some fun here
1yaa5_d-zg0_7-8-rgb_front we are going to draw a huge huge feather coming off the top of her head there a big big big thing and this will be sort of her little headdress
1yaa5_d-zg0_8-8-rgb_front so just kind of start by drawing the lower edges of it just lightly kind of come down draw the lightly the edges
1yaa5_d-zg0_9-8-rgb_front now come down like this come up and draw a definite shape though
1ykbepmnuwe_0-8-rgb_front some of the common mistakes you may experience while learning how to do a nollie lipslide is basically getting into it and making sure that your back wheels clear the obstacle because they have to get all the way above it before you can lipslide
1ykbepmnuwe_1-8-rgb_front so remember you are going to want to nollie and get over the obstacle and come down into it
1ykbepmnuwe_2-8-rgb_front you do not want to hit it on the way up so you want to make sure that your nollie is high enough to get into lipslide
1ykbepmnuwe_3-8-rgb_front the other common mistake people make is that once you are sliding on the bar the bar is just a small obstacle so it is really slick against your board so a lot of times people find that they land on the lipslide and it shoots out
1ykbepmnuwe_4-8-rgb_front this can end up with you with both of your feet on different sides of the bar in the middle of the bar or with your feet running into the bar which is pretty bad
1ykbepmnuwe_5-8-rgb_front so what you want to do is stay directly over the board and make sure you know how far the thing is going to slide and how fast it is going to slide so you are ready when you end up doing it
1yr0gf3vd4w_0-8-rgb_front in this clip i am going to talk about another skin type that needs to exfoliate a lot
1yr0gf3vd4w_1-8-rgb_front that is acneic skin
1yr0gf3vd4w_10-8-rgb_front if you are someone who had pustules and infected acne you would want to go for something more like the microfoliant which is the rice bran exfoliant which is going to be gentle because if you came on this skin with a rough scrub you can break the skin and spread infection and bacteria and you will get the opposite result that you desire
1yr0gf3vd4w_11-8-rgb_front you want to use something that also contains salicylic acid which is an antibacterial agent
1yr0gf3vd4w_2-8-rgb_front acneic skin meaning breakouts blackheads pimples
1yr0gf3vd4w_3-8-rgb_front it is so important to exfoliate but it is important to have you exfoliate when you have acneic skin
1yr0gf3vd4w_4-8-rgb_front you are going to want to use if you are oily with blackheads you are going to want to use a more granular scrub like the skin prep scrub that has the cornmeal that we used earlier
1yr0gf3vd4w_5-8-rgb_front this is a rougher scrub
1yr0gf3vd4w_6-8-rgb_front the skin is thicker
1yr0gf3vd4w_7-8-rgb_front it can handle it
1yr0gf3vd4w_8-8-rgb_front you certainly would not want to use this on the sensitive skin
1yr0gf3vd4w_9-8-rgb_front the reason why we want to be more aggressive is really want to loosen those dead skin cells and allow the blackheads to release
1yuefvwwcpc_0-8-rgb_front let is talk now about how to select a jig rod
1yuefvwwcpc_1-8-rgb_front there is many different varieties out there
1yuefvwwcpc_10-8-rgb_front it is very sensitive because the pan fish are very light biters so you want a sensitive rod tip to feel that bite and also to cushion that fish as it comes up
1yuefvwwcpc_11-8-rgb_front typically with pan fish you are fishing with very light line maybe two or four pound test monofilament
1yuefvwwcpc_12-8-rgb_front that rod again is working to your advantage
1yuefvwwcpc_2-8-rgb_front they all come down at their most basic to having a handle and a reel seat so you can attach your reel to it
1yuefvwwcpc_3-8-rgb_front then simply the more sensitive end of the rod along with rod eyelets
1yuefvwwcpc_4-8-rgb_front you can buy these jig rods
1yuefvwwcpc_5-8-rgb_front it is a combination that come with both the rod and the reel or you can buy the rod and the reel separately
1yuefvwwcpc_6-8-rgb_front ultimately what you want to do is match the size rod and the action of the rod to the fish species that you are fishing for
1yuefvwwcpc_7-8-rgb_front for example if i were fishing for lake trout or bass or larger fish such as that i would want a rod that was not very flexible
1yuefvwwcpc_8-8-rgb_front i would want one even stiffer than this that did not have this give because when you need to set that hook on a bigger fish or at greater depths you want stoutness of that rod to work in your advantage
1yuefvwwcpc_9-8-rgb_front however when you are fishing for perch or sunfish you want a rod with lighter action that bends almost at the drop of a hat
1yzi_p9xbh8_0-8-rgb_front hey guys today we will be talking about setting up dj lighting
1yzi_p9xbh8_1-8-rgb_front in most cases djs at clubs are not really responsible for setting up and maintaining the lighting
1yzi_p9xbh8_2-8-rgb_front lighting technicians are usually brought in but we will talk about it a little bit anyway
1yzi_p9xbh8_3-8-rgb_front in most cases nowadays lighting are set up on intelligent lighting controllers
1yzi_p9xbh8_4-8-rgb_front these are computers with dedicated programs that run all the series of different lights throughout the club
1yzi_p9xbh8_5-8-rgb_front at any given time throughout the club the engineer who is working the lights can just go over to the computer select a different setting boom all the lights in the club change
1yzi_p9xbh8_6-8-rgb_front and there is different things between strobe lights cyber lights par cans led lighting to change colors around the club black lights and things that make things glow and even and nitrogen and things that come down that look like smoke and fog and cold air and whatnot
1yzi_p9xbh8_7-8-rgb_front it really helps the dj because if the lighting guy and the lighting is set up correctly it really just emphasizes the party and makes everybody is energy go a step further
1yzi_p9xbh8_8-8-rgb_front so a good dj with a good lighting setup and a good lighting technician can make a great party
1yecndpqv50_1-8-rgb_front and now we are going to discuss landing on the lava field from the expansion volcarren wasteland in heroscape
1yecndpqv50_2-8-rgb_front now here we have our orc guy and he has a move of five and he is going to move through the volcanic field
1yecndpqv50_3-8-rgb_front we have
1yecndpqv50_4-8-rgb_front now that he has landed on or ended his turn or ended his moves on a lava field he is going to roll for lava field damage
1yecndpqv50_5-8-rgb_front now to roll for lava field damage you are going to take one attack die which is a die with a skull on two sides and the blank on four and you are going to roll and there is a skull
1yecndpqv50_6-8-rgb_front now since there is a skull you will put a wound counter on the card that is the orc is card and that will signify one damage that has been dealt to this creature
1yecndpqv50_7-8-rgb_front now this damage will take the creature to zero life then this creature will be destroyed and will be removed from the game
1yecndpqv50_8-8-rgb_front once again lava fields are very dangerous and if you move through a lava field you will have to roll for every time you end your turn on a lava field square
1ymfwc521pe_1-8-rgb_front one of the biggest issues that come up in many non profits is the dynamic between the board of directors and those who we call operations the staff
1ymfwc521pe_2-8-rgb_front and what happens is the board wants to get involved in staff issues or the staff wants to cross over to the board operations
1ymfwc521pe_3-8-rgb_front it is a mediate way to cause friction and that is what you really do not need to have it is a good idea if the board frankly goes through board training and learn how to be a board of directors
1ymfwc521pe_4-8-rgb_front how to be responsible for the vision of the organization keep your eye on the finances but primarily set overall policy that has been carried out by the staff
1ymfwc521pe_5-8-rgb_front when the board starts crossing into the staff area there is going to be conflict there is no need for it there is always a way around that sort of thing
1ymfwc521pe_6-8-rgb_front what the staff needs to remember that they are trying to further the organization they are taking a day to day needy greedy work of the group and making it happen
1ymfwc521pe_7-8-rgb_front they should consult the board absolutely they should let the board now what is going on at all times have open lines of communication at all times
1ymfwc521pe_8-8-rgb_front but it is a good idea from the get go to have a slight line from the board and those folks from the operations cause it makes everybody happy and makes things move a lot smoother
1ymfwc521pe_9-8-rgb_front in the next segment i am going to cover the publicity and the out rage of capacity of the building if you will for your organization stay with me
1yna7iv3oj8_0-8-rgb_front amanda claire so here is a little volt meter
1yna7iv3oj8_1-8-rgb_front actually this is a multimeter
1yna7iv3oj8_10-8-rgb_front this one has different kind of levels of sensitivity here right
1yna7iv3oj8_11-8-rgb_front so you know we can set this
1yna7iv3oj8_12-8-rgb_front i will set this on which means it will measure up to volts on that setting
1yna7iv3oj8_13-8-rgb_front and so you know i will take this battery and i will put you know on one side and on the other
1yna7iv3oj8_14-8-rgb_front actually i need to look at this so let is see
1yna7iv3oj8_15-8-rgb_front so i put on one side and on the other and aha
1yna7iv3oj8_16-8-rgb_front it measures and so you do not think i am making it up
1yna7iv3oj8_17-8-rgb_front i will show you
1yna7iv3oj8_18-8-rgb_front here is the battery and then we will go like this and aha
1yna7iv3oj8_19_20_21-8-rgb_front it is measuring something okay something which is you know through no small coincidence the voltage of a aa battery
1yna7iv3oj8_2-8-rgb_front there are a lot of functions that this particular one can measure
1yna7iv3oj8_22-8-rgb_front so because this is measuring that means this battery is still okay and it will still work for a little while
1yna7iv3oj8_23-8-rgb_front and so you can use this to kinda test a bunch of batteries and as long as they are kinda measure up at about volts give or take of a few millivolts you can still use that battery
1yna7iv3oj8_3-8-rgb_front basically what it is is it is a little gadget that measures how much voltage is flowing between contacts and you use these little kinda contact points these little wires to make that measurement
1yna7iv3oj8_4-8-rgb_front so you know i would not get too scared about a tool like this
1yna7iv3oj8_5-8-rgb_front i know it sounds really technical
1yna7iv3oj8_6-8-rgb_front some circuit vendors work on project where it maybe is necessary to know how much voltage is flowing across the circuit board so that you might need to put a resistor in there or install a capacitor in
1yna7iv3oj8_7-8-rgb_front i am not going to be talking about that much during this series because we are kind of talking about introduction of circuit bending but that is something that you may need a volt meter for in the future to be able to really make a good measurements of you know the amount of voltage that is flowing across different parts of the circuit so you can calculate whether you need a resistor or a capacitor there but all that aside a volt meter is also really helpful for testing your batteries
1yna7iv3oj8_8-8-rgb_front you ought to see if they are any good anymore
1yna7iv3oj8_9-8-rgb_front one like this basically there is different kinds of volt meters
1yp-xuljndm_0-8-rgb_front we are going to do a nice little peck stretch for keri here
1yp-xuljndm_1-8-rgb_front so i am going to come up first starting in kneeling diamond
1yp-xuljndm_10-8-rgb_front and ask your client to intertwine their fingers
1yp-xuljndm_11-8-rgb_front now slightly have them lean back just a few inches
1yp-xuljndm_12-8-rgb_front take your hands on the outside and just gently start opening up
1yp-xuljndm_13-8-rgb_front talk to your client
1yp-xuljndm_14-8-rgb_front let them know is that enough
1yp-xuljndm_15-8-rgb_front too much
1yp-xuljndm_16-8-rgb_front little more
1yp-xuljndm_17-8-rgb_front little more
1yp-xuljndm_18-8-rgb_front good
1yp-xuljndm_19-8-rgb_front now ease off and then do it again
1yp-xuljndm_2-8-rgb_front i am going to place a pillow on her back and that is the reason is is i am going to be putting my knee into her back and i do not want to crunch bones against bones
1yp-xuljndm_20-8-rgb_front open up good peck stretch here
1yp-xuljndm_21-8-rgb_front one more time
1yp-xuljndm_22-8-rgb_front easing off
1yp-xuljndm_23-8-rgb_front and gently opening it up
1yp-xuljndm_24-8-rgb_front perfect
1yp-xuljndm_25-8-rgb_front ease them up slowly
1yp-xuljndm_26-8-rgb_front sweep the arms down have a hand on your shoulders steady yourself as you come down
1yp-xuljndm_3-8-rgb_front we want make sure they are comfortable
1yp-xuljndm_4-8-rgb_front and also you are safe
1yp-xuljndm_5-8-rgb_front so first placing my knee into her back
1yp-xuljndm_6-8-rgb_front now i am in a nice warrior stance
1yp-xuljndm_7-8-rgb_front i am going to slightly slide my opposite leg back so i have some nice steadiness there
1yp-xuljndm_8-8-rgb_front i am going to sweep down grab a hold of this hand place it behind the head
1yp-xuljndm_9-8-rgb_front sweep down bring it back
1z4f7kn6ywy_0-8-rgb_front so now i have completed my scoring on the top ring and the bottom ring
1z4f7kn6ywy_1-8-rgb_front the next thing i am going to do is take a paint brush you could do this with your finger or sponge and simply go all the way around and put slip all over my scored area like this
1z4f7kn6ywy_10-8-rgb_front i like to just simply use a wet a wooden spoon like this wet it down and put it on the inside
1z4f7kn6ywy_11-8-rgb_front and i am going to use this as a support to push down the top part onto the bottom part
1z4f7kn6ywy_12-8-rgb_front i am going to stick my spoon inside and then move the wheel around and apply quite a lot of force onto the base there
1z4f7kn6ywy_13-8-rgb_front so that the two parts become one
1z4f7kn6ywy_14-8-rgb_front again holding this on the underside there you can see that edge is being used and pushing it up underneath and pushing my finger down on the top to ensure a nice connection
1z4f7kn6ywy_15-8-rgb_front i am actually applying more pressure than what it may look like
1z4f7kn6ywy_16-8-rgb_front straight down you can actually see the clay working down into the body of the other part
1z4f7kn6ywy_17-8-rgb_front okay so now i have pushed the top part down onto the bottom part the slip is there i might want to take some extra slip afterwards and just simply go around the edge there
1z4f7kn6ywy_18-8-rgb_front then i can go over and take out any grooves that i might have put into the clay like so
1z4f7kn6ywy_19-8-rgb_front perhaps take a sponge just to wipe everything down at the end like that
1z4f7kn6ywy_2-8-rgb_front i am going to repeat the same process here working my way all the way around giving lots of slip on there like that
1z4f7kn6ywy_20-8-rgb_front any slur that might have gotten on there take it off
1z4f7kn6ywy_21-8-rgb_front okay so as you can see we have now completed the throwing and assembly of our two part vase
1z4f7kn6ywy_22-8-rgb_front in the next section i will just be talking briefly about tips on finishing this up and getting it ready for the kiln
1z4f7kn6ywy_23-8-rgb_front and we will be talking about that next
1z4f7kn6ywy_3-8-rgb_front okay so now i have completed slipping my pot and as you can see i have a nice thick layer on the top and the bottom
1z4f7kn6ywy_4-8-rgb_front when doing a two part vase like this you might want to then turn the wheel and simply make some circular marks to let you know where to put it on
1z4f7kn6ywy_5-8-rgb_front we can get rid of these afterwards these marks
1z4f7kn6ywy_6-8-rgb_front so now we have an idea of where we want to stick the top
1z4f7kn6ywy_7-8-rgb_front now we are going to take this top turn it over simply place it on to one of our rings like so maybe turn the wheel see how centered it is
1z4f7kn6ywy_8-8-rgb_front you could repeat the centering process with a needle tool to get this absolutely and correctly in place however that looks pretty good
1z4f7kn6ywy_9-8-rgb_front so now what i am going to want to do they make a variety of tools to go inside
1zf-gpz0ofw_0-5-rgb_front in this section we are going to be discussing a model known as of customer service
1zf-gpz0ofw_10-5-rgb_front the three solve or identify your customers issue within three minutes now is that a hard and fast rule no but it is a very good guideline
1zf-gpz0ofw_11-5-rgb_front when you put together the of customer service you will be providing great customer service for him or her
1zf-gpz0ofw_2-5-rgb_front in this section we are going to discuss the model known as the of customer service
1zf-gpz0ofw_3-5-rgb_front now it is just a model meant to help you remember the different types of customer service and what is important as far as following those steps
1zf-gpz0ofw_4-5-rgb_front the one in customer service is to remember to deal with only one customer at a time
1zf-gpz0ofw_5-5-rgb_front it does not matter what customer just came before or what customer your anticipating will come next or whatever distractions maybe going around you
1zf-gpz0ofw_6-5-rgb_front it is most important to remember that when you are dealing with a customer that is only your customer at that time
1zf-gpz0ofw_7-5-rgb_front the two customer service is a two way exchange
1zf-gpz0ofw_8-5-rgb_front now it is not always just all about the customer wants but you have some input or to make any of that experience great for the customer as well
1zf-gpz0ofw_9-5-rgb_front so remember two way exchange we will discuss all of these a little bit more detail
1zg5sq4eymg_0-3-rgb_front another great restorative for releasing back tension is placing your legs up the wall
1zg5sq4eymg_1-3-rgb_front and you could do this with or without support depends how high you want to lift your pelvis up
1zg5sq4eymg_10-3-rgb_front you can let your legs rest slightly
1zg5sq4eymg_11-3-rgb_front this helps get circulation the blood flowing down from the feet
1zg5sq4eymg_12-3-rgb_front if you spend a lot of time on your feet standing anything like this this is an excellent posture for relieving leg tension helping get the blood out if you have got varicose veins problem and things like that this also helps
1zg5sq4eymg_13-3-rgb_front set your timer grab your eye pillow and just rest your hand on your stomach
1zg5sq4eymg_14-3-rgb_front and that is legs up the wall pose
1zg5sq4eymg_2-3-rgb_front i place a chair here instead of i do not have a wall nearby
1zg5sq4eymg_3-3-rgb_front so what you will do is you will scoot your bolster down towards the wall
1zg5sq4eymg_4-3-rgb_front you have your single folded blanket in the back
1zg5sq4eymg_5-3-rgb_front with the wall it is a little bit easier to do this but what you will do is you bring your behind up so you probably want to scoot the bolster even closer
1zg5sq4eymg_6-3-rgb_front then slowly scoot if the wall was right here so i am going to scoot my wall closer but you will put your legs to the side and press your toes into the wall and then let yourself legs go up the wall
1zg5sq4eymg_7-3-rgb_front now my blanket i need to scoot down make sure it is nice and flat any kinks within the blankets will make it quite uncomfortable
1zg5sq4eymg_8-3-rgb_front and then slowly bring your legs up the wall
1zg5sq4eymg_9-3-rgb_front and with an actual wall here you will have support on your behind all the way up your legs
1zretq9v2ri_1-8-rgb_front in this video clip we will be calculating the area of a circle
1zretq9v2ri_2-8-rgb_front on this end table we are going to be putting a custom covering on the top and we need to figure out how much area this circle is
1zretq9v2ri_3-8-rgb_front the first thing we need to do is find the diameter of the circle here we have the diameter of about and we are actually looking for the radius
1zretq9v2ri_4-8-rgb_front so we are going to take which is half of the diameter
1zretq9v2ri_5-8-rgb_front what we are going to do from here is take a pie times the radius square so it will be x x and that is going to give us a total area of square inches of that circular top
1zu0glcgajq_0-8-rgb_front this is anthony and we are going to talk today about tabletop photography lighting tips
1zu0glcgajq_1-8-rgb_front now one of the best types of strobe lighting i like to use for tabletop photography is a nice couple of big soft boxes
1zu0glcgajq_2-8-rgb_front soft boxes are strobe units that have big white cloth box around them and i point them at degree angles at my tabletop or some kind of angle and make the lighting interesting so that is one of the first lighting elements i like to use for tabletop photography
1zu0glcgajq_3-8-rgb_front also iike to use natural light when i can if i have a diffused window pointed at my tabletop
1zu0glcgajq_4-8-rgb_front now that is not always possible in the studio so i really enjoy using the soft boxes
1zu0glcgajq_5-8-rgb_front the other type of lighting that i like to use is an underlight i call it and that is a tabletop that i can see through and i have a light that will come up from the bottom and again it really depends on what i am photographing
1zu0glcgajq_6-8-rgb_front sometimes i will be photographing different types of scientific things that really need to look almost translucent where i c an almost build a layer of different types of whatever i am photographing so that back light or bottom light as i like to call it is very helpful
1zu0glcgajq_7_8-8-rgb_front the other type of lighting or part of my lighting set up that i like to use is a monitor when i am shooting digitally which is almost of the time in my tabletop photography the image that i shoot transfers right away to my monitor and i have a very big monitor so i can instantly see what my lighting looks like and it helps me adjusting and tweak and make my product or whatever i am photographing on the tabletop look the way i want it to look and those are some great tips on how to light tabletop photography
1zwgv-_ykru_1-8-rgb_front another technique that competitors like to use to intimidate their opponents is slamming their elbows on the table
1zwgv-_ykru_10-8-rgb_front my wrist likes to be hooked
1zwgv-_ykru_11-8-rgb_front so he is got me like this the best i can do is just hold on until he loses his momentum and then i can start gaining mine back because that is when he is weak
1zwgv-_ykru_12-8-rgb_front otherwise i end up straining my wrist and it is a sure thing that i will end up losing the match
1zwgv-_ykru_2-8-rgb_front this is no good
1zwgv-_ykru_3-8-rgb_front this takes away from your strength
1zwgv-_ykru_4-8-rgb_front the shock of your elbow from the table simply takes away from your advantage
1zwgv-_ykru_5-8-rgb_front remember that we are only flesh and blood
1zwgv-_ykru_6-8-rgb_front we do not want to smack our elbows onto the table
1zwgv-_ykru_7-8-rgb_front it is not going to intimidate anyone
1zwgv-_ykru_8-8-rgb_front it never intimidated me
1zwgv-_ykru_9-8-rgb_front what we do not want to do is if richie gains his advantage as he is coming down on me like this and bends my wrist i do not want to try and reflex my wrist as far as i can because i am a hook wrestler
1zk7y3mjuu4_0-8-rgb_front so now that we have a nice done we are going to need to smooth this out and make it look a little prettier and we are also going to want to torch this so that the clay will be firm enough that we can make the cuts that we need to make into it
1zk7y3mjuu4_1-8-rgb_front it also helps make the dome smoother when you torch it
1zk7y3mjuu4_10-8-rgb_front now you want to undercut this poke a hole for that air that builds up to escape and the water that is in there and we are ready to cut the holes
1zk7y3mjuu4_2-8-rgb_front the reason for this first you want to get your propane torch and it helps to have a tool a pliers to help open this up because your hands are going to be wet and you are not going to be able to turn that knob and then you need either a sparker or a lighter
1zk7y3mjuu4_3-8-rgb_front so you want to turn this kind of slowly and hold the torch against the pot
1zk7y3mjuu4_4-8-rgb_front this is going to serve a couple of purposes
1zk7y3mjuu4_5-8-rgb_front the first is it is going to dry this out a little bit for us which we need in order to do the next step
1zk7y3mjuu4_6-8-rgb_front the other thing it is going to do is the heat is going to expand the air on the inside of this dome and it is going to cause a little bit of pressure that is going to push against the walls of the dome so when we go back with our rib to smooth it that will actually help us out a lot to keep the dome from collapsing
1zk7y3mjuu4_7-8-rgb_front now you do not want to keep the torch in one place for too very long
1zk7y3mjuu4_8-8-rgb_front it is important to keep it moving so that you do not get any of the clay too hard you can make it crack
1zk7y3mjuu4_9-8-rgb_front and now that you have got it just a little bit firmer and drier turn off your torch take your rib and smooth the dome out a little bit more
1zwejcdfusm_0-8-rgb_front we are going to add one more element to our egyptian walk circling with it
1zwejcdfusm_1-8-rgb_front so as we travel we are going to think about angling our body
1zwejcdfusm_10-8-rgb_front and again here it will be angled slightly step and here step
1zwejcdfusm_11-8-rgb_front let is try it again with just plain ibis arms you can always vary vary put variations on the arms
1zwejcdfusm_12-8-rgb_front turning the left step up shoulders are square to the wall step and step
1zwejcdfusm_13-8-rgb_front good
1zwejcdfusm_2-8-rgb_front so we still want to be square on with whoever we are facing but we are going to angle the lower body upper body stays square
1zwejcdfusm_3-8-rgb_front so it is going to be step twist a little bit of twist with the lower body
1zwejcdfusm_4-8-rgb_front but the hip is still going straight up into the rib cage
1zwejcdfusm_5-8-rgb_front step and twist again step and step twist step lower body
1zwejcdfusm_6-8-rgb_front so what that means is that your feet are not going to be square on to the wall
1zwejcdfusm_7-8-rgb_front going to be angled slightly
1zwejcdfusm_8-8-rgb_front okay
1zwejcdfusm_9-8-rgb_front so then as you turn you are going to angle slightly from the direct line here
1_04cx7yytg_0-8-rgb_front now i am going to show you some things about bent water keys
1_04cx7yytg_1-8-rgb_front this one here is bent and it is hitting the slide tube which is not a good thing because you can about imagine over time it is going to make a little dent in your slide which will make the slide not properly work
1_04cx7yytg_2-8-rgb_front so we will take our little round nose pliers and this one does not need to be moved too much and if you feel a little squeamish about doing this go ahead and just take it to your local repair facility
1_04cx7yytg_3-8-rgb_front i am using my thumb as well as the pliers for a little bit of leverage and we just want to move that over just a little bit to get it into the proper position
1_04cx7yytg_4-8-rgb_front and if this is not if this is bent the key part that covers your water key hole if that is bent then your slide will leak you will not play properly
1_04cx7yytg_5-8-rgb_front so it is very imperative that your water key works properly on your trombone
1_04cx7yytg_6-8-rgb_front and that is how to properly repair a bent water key
1_7kwjlgbvw_0-8-rgb_front so once we are in our split position it is very beneficial to try and bend forward with that which will then stretch all of the muscles along the front of the leg
1_7kwjlgbvw_1-8-rgb_front now it is very challenging to do this sometimes so all we are going to try and do to begin with is to walk the hands slightly forward and extend them out as far as they can go
1_7kwjlgbvw_2-8-rgb_front and from this position just hold that position and breathe
1_7kwjlgbvw_3-8-rgb_front whatever position we get our bodies into if we can hold the position and breathe we give the muscles a chance to relax
1_7kwjlgbvw_4-8-rgb_front we allow them to fill with oxygen we allow them to get the fibrous tissue to be much more flexible
1_7kwjlgbvw_5-8-rgb_front so holding positions and breathing is very important
1_n0aq04tra_0-8-rgb_front and now we are going to make a it is called a it is a free form teapot
1_n0aq04tra_1-8-rgb_front which means i am just going to throw it
1_n0aq04tra_10-8-rgb_front so you want to start with a nice wedged piece of clay
1_n0aq04tra_11-8-rgb_front and you want to remember once you get that wedged that that is the part that is going on the wheel head
1_n0aq04tra_12-8-rgb_front and that is the part with the dimple that is going to go up
1_n0aq04tra_13-8-rgb_front so other wise this little dimple will give you problems all the way up
1_n0aq04tra_14-8-rgb_front now we got that want to bring it to the wheel
1_n0aq04tra_15-8-rgb_front going to clean off our wheel head
1_n0aq04tra_16-8-rgb_front from there
1_n0aq04tra_17-8-rgb_front alright
1_n0aq04tra_18-8-rgb_front now i am going to put that over there
1_n0aq04tra_19-8-rgb_front i am going to save it
1_n0aq04tra_2-8-rgb_front i am going to assemble it
1_n0aq04tra_20-8-rgb_front get this on center as much as possible
1_n0aq04tra_21-8-rgb_front alright
1_n0aq04tra_22-8-rgb_front now we are ready to go
1_n0aq04tra_3-8-rgb_front i am going to move it around
1_n0aq04tra_4-8-rgb_front i am going to make it to where this teapot looks like it is dancing or i am going to try
1_n0aq04tra_5-8-rgb_front so it is going to look like it is dancing or it is going to look like it is drunk
1_n0aq04tra_6-8-rgb_front either one it will be good
1_n0aq04tra_7-8-rgb_front and they are fun to make
1_n0aq04tra_8-8-rgb_front it is all about assembling
1_n0aq04tra_9-8-rgb_front and throwing these pieces throwing slabs all of it it is real fun
1_vj7epzjag_0-8-rgb_front my name is abby jones and i am talking about the process of moving into a new apartment or a new space and making that process easy and efficient
1_vj7epzjag_1-8-rgb_front and right now i am talking specifically about organizing and moving into a new home office
1_vj7epzjag_2-8-rgb_front so one thing that i noticed when i accessed this space was that there is no built in storage and my furniture does not have any built in storage either
1_vj7epzjag_3-8-rgb_front so something that i am going to use to create storage are these baskets which you can get at any kind of craft store or that kind of thing and they kind of create faux drawers
1_vj7epzjag_4-8-rgb_front so i will place them on the shelves put my things in them and then i can just pull them out as i need it but they help keep things contained i can separate different kinds of supplies different projects in each basket so it can all be contained in one space
1__h9mdl590_0-8-rgb_front as good of a tool as pencil is it is not always the obvious choice to use
1__h9mdl590_1-8-rgb_front some of the detail that i get involved with as an example on with horsehair you would think that a pencil would work really well and i could just go and make these fine lines and use a pencil to do that
1__h9mdl590_2-8-rgb_front typically that does not work all that well because what happens almost every line that you make with a pencil you can only you can not get as thin you can not get as fine a detail and about every third or fourth line that you make you have to resharpen
1__h9mdl590_3-8-rgb_front so what would happen is what you might obviously think a pencil would work great chances are it will not
1__h9mdl590_4-8-rgb_front so you need to again you need to experiment with your equipment find out okay can i use a pencil on this or do i just need a really really fine brush
1__h9mdl590_5-8-rgb_front and you will see as an example in this piece the only place i used pencil here was on some of the leather and all the rest of the pieces is used a really fine brush to get the horsehair
1__h9mdl590_6-8-rgb_front so again it just comes with experimenting and knowing your tools and you can have a lot of fun with it
1__h9mdl590_7-8-rgb_front so as versatile as these pencils are and as really they really work well for a lot of things but remember this is water color
1__h9mdl590_8-8-rgb_front so do not rely too much on the extra tools and always go back to your original fashioned paint and water and brushes and you will be happy
1_gd9m2tkvq_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is lincoln ward
1_gd9m2tkvq_1-8-rgb_front i am the director of the austin tennis center here in austin texas
1_gd9m2tkvq_10-8-rgb_front not extra feet but a couple extra inches worth of cut off
1_gd9m2tkvq_11-8-rgb_front but that is pretty much the length of the string on your tennis racket
1_gd9m2tkvq_2-8-rgb_front today we are going to talk about how long the string is on your tennis racket
1_gd9m2tkvq_3-8-rgb_front you would be surprised that this this little frame holds almost or over feet of string
1_gd9m2tkvq_4-8-rgb_front these the the mains which run up and down on your racket use about eighteen feet worth of string
1_gd9m2tkvq_5-8-rgb_front these cross sections use about sixteen feet of string
1_gd9m2tkvq_6-8-rgb_front however the string the exact amount of string you are going to use on your racket will also depend on the size of your the head of your racket
1_gd9m2tkvq_7-8-rgb_front as this this head is much smaller than this head it is going to use a considerable amount less of string
1_gd9m2tkvq_8-8-rgb_front but any time you string your racket you want to set aside about feet linear feet of string for your racket
1_gd9m2tkvq_9-8-rgb_front the the will will also add a couple of extra feet and you have to cut off
1_j3bp8unzg_0-8-rgb_front hello
1_j3bp8unzg_2-8-rgb_front in the age of technology that we are in today you need a lot more than just the demo to get signed
1_j3bp8unzg_3-8-rgb_front the labels have been hurting to the point where they are being a lot more fussy about who they sign
1_j3bp8unzg_4-8-rgb_front you therefore need to have something going with your demo
1_j3bp8unzg_5-8-rgb_front it is not just good enough today to have music
1_j3bp8unzg_6-8-rgb_front all the labels do research and they are looking to find out if your act is playing out anywhere can you sell tickets do you have a song on the radio do you have a big list do you have any sort of a following
1_j3bp8unzg_7-8-rgb_front you need something more than just the music today to solidify and give a label to be a reason to be excited about you
1_j3bp8unzg_8-8-rgb_front because the cost of doing business today is so excessive and so expensive that they are looking to limit their risk any way possible
1_u_51a8m8o_1-8-rgb_front today i would be talking about how to clip a horse
1_u_51a8m8o_10-8-rgb_front so for this if you want to make sure we would cross over to the other side make sure that it is even
1_u_51a8m8o_11-8-rgb_front that you have not missed any of these long hairs and you can see how ready he is getting a nicer profile
1_u_51a8m8o_2-8-rgb_front the next thing that we would do is clip the underside of his jaw
1_u_51a8m8o_3-8-rgb_front this is going to get his face just a nicer profile less of this shaggy look
1_u_51a8m8o_4-8-rgb_front again carefully turn the clippers on
1_u_51a8m8o_5-8-rgb_front make sure that your horse is comfortable with it
1_u_51a8m8o_6-8-rgb_front i like to start right underneath his chin where the muzzle where we are going to be working in the muzzle before and just slowly work my way up
1_u_51a8m8o_7-8-rgb_front that could be hard when you horse is really hairy as he is to get a nice even look because the rest of his hair is so long
1_u_51a8m8o_8-8-rgb_front we would get this really long stuff off
1_u_51a8m8o_9-8-rgb_front it is important to make sure that we get both sides evenly
1_udnnvfdp4_1-8-rgb_front and this is how you perform kung fu sparing technique hook block side kick versus side kick
1_udnnvfdp4_10-8-rgb_front they slide up and kick you are going to block hooking with the palm
1_udnnvfdp4_11-8-rgb_front blocking more with the forearm
1_udnnvfdp4_12-8-rgb_front pick the foot up and drive the kick into the solar plexus
1_udnnvfdp4_13-8-rgb_front do one more
1_udnnvfdp4_14-8-rgb_front one two
1_udnnvfdp4_15-8-rgb_front from another angle so you can see
1_udnnvfdp4_16-8-rgb_front switch your feet
1_udnnvfdp4_17-8-rgb_front slide up
1_udnnvfdp4_18-8-rgb_front one two
1_udnnvfdp4_19-8-rgb_front just like that
1_udnnvfdp4_2-8-rgb_front now the hook block is used dropping the arm just like this
1_udnnvfdp4_20-8-rgb_front switch feet
1_udnnvfdp4_21-8-rgb_front one slow
1_udnnvfdp4_22-8-rgb_front one a little faster
1_udnnvfdp4_23-8-rgb_front just like that
1_udnnvfdp4_24-8-rgb_front now again this technique takes a little bit of timing
1_udnnvfdp4_25-8-rgb_front you do not want to dodge too far to the left and you do not want to dodge too far forward
1_udnnvfdp4_26-8-rgb_front so it takes a little bit of practice to get what your natural distance will be
1_udnnvfdp4_27-8-rgb_front again my name is wes rhodes
1_udnnvfdp4_28-8-rgb_front i am from the chinese kung fu academy
1_udnnvfdp4_29-8-rgb_front and that is how you perform the hook block side kick versus side kick
1_udnnvfdp4_3-8-rgb_front as you do this technique you are going to actually step to the side to get out of the way
1_udnnvfdp4_4-8-rgb_front you are going to hook block and lift the leg up and then drive the technique into the solar plexus
1_udnnvfdp4_5-8-rgb_front so here is one slow so you can see it
1_udnnvfdp4_6-8-rgb_front it is one two
1_udnnvfdp4_7-8-rgb_front one done a little faster
1_udnnvfdp4_8-8-rgb_front one two
1_udnnvfdp4_9-8-rgb_front the way it looks with an opponent they are going to do a left leg side kick and you are actually going to parry to the inside of their body
1_ydoqekewa_0-8-rgb_front part of choosing what drug test is going to be right for you and your use in the home is of course the reason for which you are going to be using it
1_ydoqekewa_1-8-rgb_front a common reason for people to purchase a drug test is when a parent or parents have concerns about their child using drugs or when a spouse has concern about another spouse using drugs
1_ydoqekewa_2-8-rgb_front one of the major differences between using a test that requires a urine sample and using a home test that only requires a cheek swab is that the chain of custody as we would say in the medical or law enforcement field needs to be preserved with the urine sample
1_ydoqekewa_3-8-rgb_front it is possible for somebody to adulter or treat a urine sample after the fact to possibly skew the test results or to trigger a false positive a false negative in the test
1_ydoqekewa_4-8-rgb_front or even prior to that it is possible for someone to take a number of over the counter purchasable products that are designed to clean the urine of drug residue or mask any drug residue that might be in the urine
1_ydoqekewa_5-8-rgb_front this can be an issue for a parent who may not be to terribly comfortable with watching their child pee in front of them to make sure that they are not swapping out the urine or using another persons urine or adding an adulterant
1_ydoqekewa_6-8-rgb_front so for somebody who is looking to test a child or spouse to see whether or not they are using drugs a cheek swab may be more advisable
1_ydoqekewa_7-8-rgb_front but in this case i am testing myself and if you are testing yourself out of your own concern a urine test should be just fine
1arny8wfqa0_0-8-rgb_front these are called pipetters
1arny8wfqa0_1-8-rgb_front and they get very precise volumes
1arny8wfqa0_10-8-rgb_front and if you just tour around our work place you will see computers lying everywhere
1arny8wfqa0_11-8-rgb_front everybody is got a laptop
1arny8wfqa0_12-8-rgb_front we have got desktops
1arny8wfqa0_13-8-rgb_front all the instruments are run by computers
1arny8wfqa0_14-8-rgb_front we have people working on super computers to do modeling
1arny8wfqa0_15-8-rgb_front so computing is a big part of it
1arny8wfqa0_16-8-rgb_front and i think if you do not like typing or computers or even kind of mathematical concepts you wont do well in this because that is a lot of what we do
1arny8wfqa0_17-8-rgb_front and then there are tools that are really more about
1arny8wfqa0_18-8-rgb_front so they are liquids or powders or chemicals or proteins
1arny8wfqa0_19-8-rgb_front and we will have a hundred little bottles all labeled with things and we are mixing them
1arny8wfqa0_2-8-rgb_front we can get down to fractions of a micro liter
1arny8wfqa0_20-8-rgb_front and it is actually very abstract intellectually because we are mixing in with a pipetter a drop of this and a drop of that and following the protocol and in our mind we see them all interacting and building things that we know are in there
1arny8wfqa0_21-8-rgb_front and then we will using an instrument to report out that everything is assembled correctly but there is nothing to see
1arny8wfqa0_22-8-rgb_front it is just a clear liquid sometimes
1arny8wfqa0_23-8-rgb_front and so those liquid or powdery agents are also tools that we use
1arny8wfqa0_24-8-rgb_front so it all has to integrate
1arny8wfqa0_25-8-rgb_front the instruments and the computing and the into experiments
1arny8wfqa0_26-8-rgb_front with the information sort of explosion in the last years there are thousands of journals about scientific experiments in medicine
1arny8wfqa0_27-8-rgb_front there are so many we really can not just thumb through and read the journals
1arny8wfqa0_28-8-rgb_front even in our own fields anymore
1arny8wfqa0_29-8-rgb_front so there is a transition right now from print journals and i have a stack of them on my desk across here where i get two or three a day and they stack up
1arny8wfqa0_3-8-rgb_front very tiny volumes but do it very accurately
1arny8wfqa0_30-8-rgb_front and people used to thumb through them but more and more this is all being done virtually so publications are being put online and then we are doing automated searches around the virus that the work on or the cell that we work on
1arny8wfqa0_31-8-rgb_front and any article that is relevant to us comes it does not matter what journal it is in
1arny8wfqa0_32-8-rgb_front so journals are still fighting for their survival and they are maintaining and there is some very high the high end journals sort of the best journals in our field would be science or nature
1arny8wfqa0_33-8-rgb_front there is another one called cell
1arny8wfqa0_34-8-rgb_front so those are probably the three top journals where you would see the very best discoveries being published
1arny8wfqa0_35-8-rgb_front but on the other hand most lay people picking that up would not understand the first word of those articles
1arny8wfqa0_36-8-rgb_front they are not good journals just to thumb through if you are not a scientist
1arny8wfqa0_37-8-rgb_front i think for a lay person scientific american translates those kind of discoveries into language that you can understand
1arny8wfqa0_38-8-rgb_front so scientific american is very good about writing things in a way that regular people can understand
1arny8wfqa0_39-8-rgb_front but we are all trying to push our discoveries in to cell science nature and these sorts of journals
1arny8wfqa0_4-8-rgb_front they have a bunch of sizes of these
1arny8wfqa0_5-8-rgb_front i would say there is two types of tools or maybe three really
1arny8wfqa0_6-8-rgb_front we use a lot of expensive equipment
1arny8wfqa0_7-8-rgb_front some of the instruments that we use might easily be half a million or a million dollars
1arny8wfqa0_8-8-rgb_front and they have very intricate parts that are typically driven by computers and software
1arny8wfqa0_9-8-rgb_front so that is another set of things that we do a lot of work on is computers
1arcg_p7vow_0-8-rgb_front costa waez i was going to talk to you today about how we do maintenance
1arcg_p7vow_1-8-rgb_front let is start with this hookah here
1arcg_p7vow_10-8-rgb_front the bottle also the same thing water and soap clean dry and be ready to use again
1arcg_p7vow_2-8-rgb_front just to tell you every time you are going to smoke hookah you are going to change the water
1arcg_p7vow_3-8-rgb_front when you are going to clean the hookah after you finish smoking you be careful when taking this one because this one preserves heat and make sure do not touch it and burn your hand
1arcg_p7vow_4-8-rgb_front just move it carefully and place it in the sink or on some place that you do not burn anything and take this one apart you wash it
1arcg_p7vow_5-8-rgb_front and if you wash it in the dishwashing machine that is fine if it is dishwashing machine safe
1arcg_p7vow_6-8-rgb_front and also you can wash it with a hand and you can soak it with hand hot hot water and soap and the bottle the same thing
1arcg_p7vow_7-8-rgb_front when you take it apart make sure the pipe always will be dry
1arcg_p7vow_8-8-rgb_front do not touch it with water and do not get it cleaned with anything
1arcg_p7vow_9-8-rgb_front this one will be soaked in the water
1apm-bfim8g_1-8-rgb_front in this segment we are going to be talking about how to find a used car online
1apm-bfim8g_2-8-rgb_front there are a lot of web sites now days dedicated strictly to used cars
1apm-bfim8g_3-8-rgb_front in fact every single dealership out there should have an online web page that will take you directly to their used car inventory
1apm-bfim8g_4-8-rgb_front there are also other companies newspapers online automobile services that should allow you to shop for your next new used car right online from the comfort of your home
1apm-bfim8g_5-8-rgb_front so forget that online is a really good way to shop for another used car
1avho4qz86q_0-8-rgb_front jewelry can be another one of the most fun things you can do with crocheting
1avho4qz86q_1-8-rgb_front now a lot of times you may see people making yarn into chokers and things
1avho4qz86q_10-8-rgb_front make another chain and continue on
1avho4qz86q_11-8-rgb_front in these particular cases we have three chains in between each bead
1avho4qz86q_12-8-rgb_front and i have used magnetic clasps to close the necklaces
1avho4qz86q_13-8-rgb_front as well as toggle clasps for the bracelets
1avho4qz86q_14-8-rgb_front the ring is made with stretchy elastic thread
1avho4qz86q_15-8-rgb_front and you can wear it on any finger and impress your friends with your huge rock
1avho4qz86q_2-8-rgb_front however what you may not realize is that you can use wire to crochet
1avho4qz86q_3-8-rgb_front i like to use gage wire
1avho4qz86q_4-8-rgb_front and you can
1avho4qz86q_5-8-rgb_front it comes in a silver tone a gold tone and you can even get it in a copper tone
1avho4qz86q_6-8-rgb_front and it is very simple and easy to do because its simply chaining
1avho4qz86q_7-8-rgb_front what you do is you string your beads on your chain in the order you want them to be
1avho4qz86q_8-8-rgb_front then you chain a couple of chains
1avho4qz86q_9-8-rgb_front go around your bead
1awffhjpoou_0-8-rgb_front hi this is rachael richardson with nutrolution in south beach miami florida
1awffhjpoou_1-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about how to pack a fresh nutritious lunch for your children and it is very important
1awffhjpoou_2-8-rgb_front i have worked with so many adults and adults who have been raised on healthy foods
1awffhjpoou_3-8-rgb_front they at least know how to revert back to doing that so it may be the biggest gift that you can literally give to your children is to teach them how to eat healthy and there is lots of healthy food that kids actually really really like
1awffhjpoou_4-8-rgb_front it is just a matter of doing a little experimentation finding those foods that your kids like and taking a little extra time to pack them up so always start with a healthy protein and a couple of things that your kids might like are some good antibiotic free ham or some of the same type of turkey or maybe some tuna salad or salmon salad that you make up
1awffhjpoou_5-8-rgb_front always include some vegetables where you can so a lot of kids like baby carrots chopped celery chopped broccoli even grape tomatoes or sliced cucumbers and you can pack a little bit of a healthy sort of ranch dressing or dressing that they like in the little tupperware next to them and then think about adding some sort of nuts that are crunchy that they will like and perhaps a piece of fruit
1awffhjpoou_6-8-rgb_front this is rachael richardson and this has been how to pack a fresh nutritious lunch for your kids
1b3ups1gd2k_0-8-rgb_front you know there are so many people that have gifts out there and i believe astrology is one way of getting into this and understanding it and really really reading up on it
1b3ups1gd2k_1-8-rgb_front i love linda goodman i adore her
1b3ups1gd2k_10-8-rgb_front i am talking to bobby and every other word out of my mouth was bobby be careful what you eat bobby watch your diet
1b3ups1gd2k_11-8-rgb_front he is not fat
1b3ups1gd2k_12-8-rgb_front just watch your colon bobby
1b3ups1gd2k_13-8-rgb_front well he and his wife and all the kids left for germany and i am sitting here right over there one afternoon and the phone rings

1b3ups1gd2k_15-8-rgb_front he says micky hi its hi southern
1b3ups1gd2k_16-8-rgb_front he said bobby is in trouble
1b3ups1gd2k_17-8-rgb_front he said on the phone with me is casper weinberg strom thurman and william buckley
1b3ups1gd2k_18-8-rgb_front bobby is had a colostomy and i gave such a scream
1b3ups1gd2k_19-8-rgb_front said and he will not do anything unless you tell
1b3ups1gd2k_2-8-rgb_front she was the greatest sunstars
1b3ups1gd2k_20-8-rgb_front and i said mr buckely my mother loves your accent and he was telling me about bobby
1b3ups1gd2k_21-8-rgb_front i said put him on a plan immediately and get him out of there get him to that place in washington
1b3ups1gd2k_22_23_24_25-8-rgb_front i forgot the name walter reed and put him through the pet machine and they said are you sure i said i am very sure
1b3ups1gd2k_26-8-rgb_front they put him the plan they him through it and he is fine
1b3ups1gd2k_27-8-rgb_front but that day lebanon was bombed and all the soldiers that were in that terrible war ended up in bobby is hospital
1b3ups1gd2k_28-8-rgb_front bobby would have been forgotten
1b3ups1gd2k_3-8-rgb_front of course there is always psychometry
1b3ups1gd2k_4-8-rgb_front if you relax take a little glass of wine i mean it and relax at a party
1b3ups1gd2k_5_6-8-rgb_front take someone is ring like i use to do or something and you would be surprised what you feel biggest challenge and most alarming challenge is when i i am very friendly with the coffins and they were in south carolina columbia and they started etv which is educational network and also ceka and we were very close friends
1b3ups1gd2k_7-8-rgb_front mrs coffins brother was being sent to germany in the army to become a colonial or something
1b3ups1gd2k_8-8-rgb_front she said would you mind talking to bobby
1b3ups1gd2k_9-8-rgb_front and i said no
1b7cdv-ssuw_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is lauren and i am here to discuss how to make an afro with straight hair
1b7cdv-ssuw_1-8-rgb_front for your temporary afro in order to go with an outfit it is easier if your hair is basically short to medium length
1b7cdv-ssuw_10-8-rgb_front back combing is done in a three step process i am turning this that way so that you may see
1b7cdv-ssuw_11-8-rgb_front you are going to take your comb and you are going to hold it about mid shaft
1b7cdv-ssuw_12-8-rgb_front you are going to go down three times one two three one two three one two three
1b7cdv-ssuw_13-8-rgb_front that way you start to get a little bit more of matted hair which will hold your style up
1b7cdv-ssuw_14-8-rgb_front now since we are doing an afro you would want to do a good amount of that hair where so that way it will stand up the way that an afro would
1b7cdv-ssuw_15-8-rgb_front so you are going to continue teasing those sections kind of matting them so that way you have more of an afro look
1b7cdv-ssuw_16-8-rgb_front as you see if i am working up the hair shaft how it kind of begins to form more of your afro look
1b7cdv-ssuw_17-8-rgb_front once you curl everything you are going to smooth it a little bit but you do not want to smooth it too much because then you are going to fall spray it and then if you need to at any given point you may want to go over and reinforce that bit of a tighter curl
1b7cdv-ssuw_18-8-rgb_front if you work around with this method throughout your entire head you will get more of what the afro look is
1b7cdv-ssuw_19-8-rgb_front again if your hair is longer you are going to want to pin it up in order to make your job a little easier and that is how to get an afro with straight hair
1b7cdv-ssuw_2-8-rgb_front once your hair is a little bit longer it makes it a little bit more difficult to get the actual afro style
1b7cdv-ssuw_3-8-rgb_front if your hair is longer one thing that you can do in order to help you achieve that style is you can actually take your hair in sections and clip them up in order to shorten the length of your hair so if i bring this up if i just kind of clip this
1b7cdv-ssuw_4-8-rgb_front now what you want to do is an x using two bobby pins in order to clip their hair up
1b7cdv-ssuw_5-8-rgb_front the x will help secure the hair up there so that way you can get started
1b7cdv-ssuw_6-8-rgb_front after you have put your hair up or if your hair is shorter you do not need to go through with this step
1b7cdv-ssuw_7-8-rgb_front you are going to take a small curling iron
1b7cdv-ssuw_8-8-rgb_front you want a small barrel because afros tend to have a very tight tight curl and you are going to curl very tiny sections at a time all throughout the entire head
1b7cdv-ssuw_9-8-rgb_front after you have curled those sections i have already curled a few here on the top you are going to use a comb and actually back comb the hair up
1ba7xtuyoyy_0-8-rgb_front this exercise is called standing twist and we are going to use a towel for this exercise
1ba7xtuyoyy_1-8-rgb_front and what we are going to do is utilize a bath towel or a hand towel so that you can keep your posture nice and upright
1ba7xtuyoyy_10-8-rgb_front and that is your standing twist
1ba7xtuyoyy_2-8-rgb_front so with your feet about hip width apart soften your knees extend your arms and simply twist from your torso
1ba7xtuyoyy_3-8-rgb_front now as you are twisting think about pulling on the ends of the towel and that will pull your shoulder blades into place
1ba7xtuyoyy_4-8-rgb_front and we are really improving the posture all at the same time
1ba7xtuyoyy_5-8-rgb_front this is a great exercise for the core while you are strengthening your upper back muscles
1ba7xtuyoyy_6-8-rgb_front so when you breathe you want to inhale to prepare exhale as you twist
1ba7xtuyoyy_7-8-rgb_front inhale as you bring the towel back to the front exhale as you twist
1ba7xtuyoyy_8-8-rgb_front and if you really focus on blowing out you will really get a great abdominal workout and then you will begin to really feel it in your upper body at the same time
1ba7xtuyoyy_9-8-rgb_front so perform this exercise for about a minute and then just lower your arms down and rest
1bjg-dsyr8k_0-8-rgb_front it is important when you pick your board size to choose something that is going to really work for you in your life
1bjg-dsyr8k_1-8-rgb_front if you have a goal and you want to have a vision board that you are going to carry with you
1bjg-dsyr8k_10-8-rgb_front that is a good way to do things
1bjg-dsyr8k_11-8-rgb_front they are kind of fun because the mailing envelopes you can get they are usually in really varied sizes
1bjg-dsyr8k_12-8-rgb_front sometimes you get big things sometimes you get little things
1bjg-dsyr8k_13-8-rgb_front you can always use cardboard if you want to use that
1bjg-dsyr8k_14-8-rgb_front if you want something square
1bjg-dsyr8k_15-8-rgb_front you can make a round vision board if you want to cut it
1bjg-dsyr8k_16-8-rgb_front then i really like bright bright colors
1bjg-dsyr8k_17-8-rgb_front you can go and you can get construction paper from someplace
1bjg-dsyr8k_18-8-rgb_front you can either i like folding things in half so i can put things in but you can buy these at any kind of you know supply place or something
1bjg-dsyr8k_19-8-rgb_front you can have it folded in half and then you are able to use a vision board
1bjg-dsyr8k_2-8-rgb_front you may want to pick up a little index card
1bjg-dsyr8k_20-8-rgb_front the most important thing when you are choosing your size is to make sure you know what you want to be able to do
1bjg-dsyr8k_21-8-rgb_front do you want it at your desk
1bjg-dsyr8k_22-8-rgb_front do you want it at your office
1bjg-dsyr8k_23-8-rgb_front do you want to keep it at home by your bedroom
1bjg-dsyr8k_24-8-rgb_front depending on the goal that you have chosen and the topic that you are doing
1bjg-dsyr8k_25-8-rgb_front you may want to have a smaller board if you want something that you are going to see when you are taking a shower
1bjg-dsyr8k_26-8-rgb_front you may put it in something where it is water proof
1bjg-dsyr8k_27-8-rgb_front really kind of think about where do you want this to be in your life and how do you want to keep it with you so that you can make sure that you have got the right size for your vision
1bjg-dsyr8k_3-8-rgb_front you do not have to make a vision board big in order for it to be effective
1bjg-dsyr8k_4-8-rgb_front you just have to have it in a place where you are going to be able to see it
1bjg-dsyr8k_5-8-rgb_front some things you may want to do small
1bjg-dsyr8k_6-8-rgb_front one of my favorite things to do is recycle
1bjg-dsyr8k_7-8-rgb_front sometimes i take envelopes that people have sent me and i use the front part for the vision board because i cover it with a lot of things
1bjg-dsyr8k_8-8-rgb_front then thing i love is that you can put stuff inside and hide it
1bjg-dsyr8k_9-8-rgb_front we will be talking about that later
1bw7ygva6ga_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is lanie mccormick
1bw7ygva6ga_1-8-rgb_front i am a fine art photographer in austin texas
1bw7ygva6ga_10-8-rgb_front it keeps the negatives flat inexpensive and very important

1byir6sr9qs_0-8-rgb_front a lot of people have a fear of falling backwards
1byir6sr9qs_1-8-rgb_front we are going to show you how to do a roll that will let you overcome that fear so if you do fall on the ground you will not hurt yourself in this manner
1byir6sr9qs_10-8-rgb_front see as he rounds out his body it makes a complete roll and it does not really hurt any of his body parts
1byir6sr9qs_2-8-rgb_front jason i am going to start the same way with the forward roll one leg up only this time obviously we are going backwards so whatever leg is up everything is going to come to that side
1byir6sr9qs_3-8-rgb_front everything is looking back to that side
1byir6sr9qs_4-8-rgb_front from here all he is going to do is put that leg up and plant it behind him go ahead
1byir6sr9qs_5-8-rgb_front he plants whatever foot is up turn around
1byir6sr9qs_6-8-rgb_front he kicks it up and he plants it behind him finishing the roll again
1byir6sr9qs_7-8-rgb_front he goes over the same shoulder around so whatever leg is up he is going to go over this shoulder
1byir6sr9qs_8-8-rgb_front making a nice tight ball he is going to go from one shoulder to the other hip again good
1byir6sr9qs_9-8-rgb_front ok so the backwards roll is from standing is if somebody comes to push you or if they come to grab you and there is something behind you and you trip and fall so i am going to demonstrate pushing on jason and he is going to take a backwards fall from standing here boom
1bjhvgrczu4_0-8-rgb_front i am trevor with monster pest control located in american fork ut today we are talking about how to rid your home of insects the topic is how to get rid of a beehive
1bjhvgrczu4_1-8-rgb_front quite often what i do is i go around inspect the house find where the hive is or where the bees or wasps are coming in and out of the house
1bjhvgrczu4_2-8-rgb_front basically take some kind of wasp bee killer and i spray the area and i get all of the area making sure i do not get stung myself and stand back far enough that you are safe
1bjhvgrczu4_3-8-rgb_front once i do that i let it sit for about ten fifteen twenty minutes and then i take my webster or pole and i clean off the nest or knock them down
1bjhvgrczu4_4-8-rgb_front you can use almost anything a stick or a pole whatever to knock down the nest
1bjhvgrczu4_5-8-rgb_front if it is really big you may want to hire a professional
1bjhvgrczu4_6-8-rgb_front another method to get rid of or rid your home of bees or wasp is by taking a mixture of water and soap usually about fifty fifty maybe a little bit less of the soap in some spray container and actually spray the nest and that will also get the wasps or bees to drop down and to die off and then you can clean off the nest

1bq4lwvsu-8_0-8-rgb_front okay so now we are going to go ahead and start filling our basket
1bq4lwvsu-8_1-8-rgb_front now we want it to look full but we do not want it to look cluttered
1bq4lwvsu-8_10-8-rgb_front because after all i think i think it really a basket like this is more of a quantity
1bq4lwvsu-8_2-8-rgb_front so it is important that you pick some things that when whatever you pick out that you kind of take a couple minutes to find the right spot for them
1bq4lwvsu-8_21-8-rgb_front you can never have too many headbands
1bq4lwvsu-8_22-8-rgb_front so i picked up a couple and i am going to go ahead and just i think stick them back here
1bq4lwvsu-8_23-8-rgb_front and everything does not have to be out in the open
1bq4lwvsu-8_24-8-rgb_front you can make them go digging for stuff
1bq4lwvsu-8_25-8-rgb_front that is also part of the fun
1bq4lwvsu-8_26-8-rgb_front you can certainly hide things under the grass
1bq4lwvsu-8_27-8-rgb_front but i think that this is a nice beginning of a display
1bq4lwvsu-8_28-8-rgb_front and again play around with it however you like
1bq4lwvsu-8_29-8-rgb_front and now we are going to go and fill it in with a few more little trinkets
1bq4lwvsu-8_3-8-rgb_front it might take a few minutes
1bq4lwvsu-8_4-8-rgb_front you may have to play around with it but that s part of the fun
1bq4lwvsu-8_5-8-rgb_front also in terms of what you use what you use in the basket to fill it a good idea is going down to your local discount store or your dollar store and just going through the bins and just finding lots of little trinkets
1bq4lwvsu-8_6-8-rgb_front there is lots of things
1bq4lwvsu-8_7-8-rgb_front lots of options and choices out there that little girls love
1bq4lwvsu-8_8-8-rgb_front and also in the children is section the toy section
1bq4lwvsu-8_9-8-rgb_front but you do not have to spend a lot of money on expensive toys
1bydxd7depi_0-8-rgb_front tina stull hi
1bydxd7depi_1-8-rgb_front i am tina stull and i drive the top dragster for interstate batteries
1bydxd7depi_10-8-rgb_front make sure you have all your safety equipment before you leave the pit and you are on your way
1bydxd7depi_3-8-rgb_front during this time it is the time that you check your tire pressure you might want to walk up and watch the light a little bit
1bydxd7depi_4-8-rgb_front in super comp we have upwards of a hundred plus cars in an event
1bydxd7depi_5-8-rgb_front so usually unless you got there at the very front of the pack you are going to be standing around a bit
1bydxd7depi_6-8-rgb_front so you can get a little bit acclimated see how you are going to be able to turn into that lane
1bydxd7depi_7-8-rgb_front some the tracks are different so sometimes you get a straight shot and it is no problem
1bydxd7depi_8-8-rgb_front sometimes you have to make turns and just kind of watching the cars ahead of you so you do not end up by having to back up and get embarrassed over that
1bydxd7depi_9-8-rgb_front then once you see the guys pretty much watch the people in front of you when they start suiting up and hopping in their cars that is probably the time for you to hop in your car
1bz6oy731gq_0-8-rgb_front in this series we are going to be working the abdominals with the challenge of using a theraband to go along with it
1bz6oy731gq_1-8-rgb_front when you are using a theraband make sure that you get a number of different weights
1bz6oy731gq_2-8-rgb_front so they come in heavy medium and light and everything in between
1bz6oy731gq_3-8-rgb_front also make sure that they are about six feet long
1bz6oy731gq_4-8-rgb_front this happens to be five so it is a little bit short particularly if you have long arms or a long torso
1bz6oy731gq_5-8-rgb_front when we do abdominal work in pilates we want to make sure we are engaging the right muscles so go ahead and put your hands around the ribcage expand the ribcage against your fingers and then exhale close that ribcage down lacing your fingers together as if it were being corseted
1bz6oy731gq_6-8-rgb_front when you do this posterior lateral breathing you engage not only the muscles around the ribcage but all the way in the back with the muscles along the spine the erector spinae as well as internal and external obliques
1bz6oy731gq_7-8-rgb_front in abdominal work you also want to pull up on the pelvic floor
1bzihm2qex8_0-8-rgb_front so i have got the lid piece
1bzihm2qex8_1-8-rgb_front now that it is set up a little bit set on the wheel again
1bzihm2qex8_10-8-rgb_front so if it feels like it is off center just turn your bat a hundred and eighty degrees
1bzihm2qex8_11-8-rgb_front and i am going to do the same thing here
1bzihm2qex8_12-8-rgb_front i am going to cut a little piece off to make the top nice and flat
1bzihm2qex8_13-8-rgb_front and i am going to wet this and score it up
1bzihm2qex8_14-8-rgb_front and now i am ready to connect these two pieces together
1bzihm2qex8_2-8-rgb_front and it is rather hard
1bzihm2qex8_3-8-rgb_front and the first thing i am going to do is just take my needle tool and make this top rim a little flat so that it will connect really easily to the other piece
1bzihm2qex8_4-8-rgb_front and then i am going to take my scoring tool get the rim wet
1bzihm2qex8_5-8-rgb_front and i have got my needle tool here so you can see you do not have to have a scoring tool
1bzihm2qex8_6-8-rgb_front just go back and forth and get that nice and scratched up
1bzihm2qex8_7-8-rgb_front set this aside get the base and put it on the wheel head
1bzihm2qex8_8-8-rgb_front and i need to turn this one eighty
1bzihm2qex8_9-8-rgb_front the bat pins are not always drilled perfectly on center

1cdogd8wpfw_23-5-rgb_front so now with that is the last stage in the bossa nova
1cdogd8wpfw_24-5-rgb_front so like i said you got the two you got the end of three
1cdogd8wpfw_25-5-rgb_front the one the end of two and the four
1cdogd8wpfw_26-5-rgb_front those are all the rim clicks
1cdogd8wpfw_3-5-rgb_front the one the end of two and the four
1cdogd8wpfw_4-5-rgb_front so this is the end of the second measure
1cdogd8wpfw_5-5-rgb_front the four of the end of the second measure
1cdogd8wpfw_6-5-rgb_front so it is going to be like this
1cdogd8wpfw_7-5-rgb_front so just keeping in your head two and four
1cdogd8wpfw_8-5-rgb_front one two three four
1cdogd8wpfw_9-5-rgb_front one two three four
1cjeknsdit4_1-8-rgb_front today we are making a backpack that would be appropriate for a child or a adult
1cjeknsdit4_10-8-rgb_front matching thread a tape measure and any other trim or applicate items that you may want to put on for decoration on your backpack
1cjeknsdit4_11-8-rgb_front those are the main things that you would need for your backpack before you get started
1cjeknsdit4_12-8-rgb_front you may want to be sure that you have them assemble so you do not have to take a break and stop and run to the store in the middle of your project
1cjeknsdit4_13-8-rgb_front probably most of the things that is needed has been mentioned here and that should take care of it for our project that we are doing today
1cjeknsdit4_2-8-rgb_front but you may want to consider exactly who this project would be made for before you go buy your supplies
1cjeknsdit4_3-8-rgb_front some of the supplies that you may want to think about when you are looking for your fabric would be trim if it is going to be for a child
1cjeknsdit4_4-8-rgb_front you may want to think about something like ricrac
1cjeknsdit4_5-8-rgb_front for an adult you may want to think about using a contrasting fabric
1cjeknsdit4_6-8-rgb_front but a different color fabric for the front and for the back that would give a little bit of contrast if it was for someone beside a child or even for a child
1cjeknsdit4_7-8-rgb_front the other things that we want to make sure that you have would be scissors pins especially when you are cutting out your fabric cord cause if we make it in the same style of this bag that i was using for a guide cord is what is used to cinch the back up at the top
1cjeknsdit4_8-8-rgb_front instead of grommets at the bottom we would be using these d rings and we would make a loop at the bottom to loop the chord through
1cjeknsdit4_9-8-rgb_front you would also need your sewing machine of course
1cnzva2285k_0-8-rgb_front when in doubt do not
1cnzva2285k_1-8-rgb_front that is the best advice i can give to you when you are asking yourself how do i decide on whether or not to go on a third date with this person

1csjz5knzw8_0-8-rgb_front yes ok thank you very much but right now i have got to dial china
1csjz5knzw8_1-8-rgb_front all right so long
1csjz5knzw8_10-8-rgb_front let is say for instance you are dialing bejing
1csjz5knzw8_11-8-rgb_front that would be then the number
1csjz5knzw8_12-8-rgb_front pretty intricate amount of numbers that you need to know and keep in mind so dialing china gets you out of the country
1csjz5knzw8_13-8-rgb_front gets you into china
1csjz5knzw8_14-8-rgb_front then let is say you are dialing bejing
1csjz5knzw8_15-8-rgb_front that would be for the city code then the number
1csjz5knzw8_16-8-rgb_front let is say it is
1csjz5knzw8_17-8-rgb_front that is simple
1csjz5knzw8_18-8-rgb_front that is how you dial china
1csjz5knzw8_19-8-rgb_front now keep in mind if you saw the olympics recently they are the technological masters of the world
1csjz5knzw8_2-8-rgb_front hi everyone
1csjz5knzw8_20-8-rgb_front their infrastructure is percent fiber optic
1csjz5knzw8_21-8-rgb_front they have got submarine cabling and lots and lots and lots of satellite links as well so you should have a great clear call to china
1csjz5knzw8_22-8-rgb_front i am russ handler
1csjz5knzw8_23-8-rgb_front have a great day
1csjz5knzw8_24-8-rgb_front if you do not mind i am going to call bejing
1csjz5knzw8_3-8-rgb_front my name is russ handler and did you ever know that when you call an international number out of the united states there is actually four separate numbers that you have to dial
1csjz5knzw8_4-8-rgb_front pretty interesting and a lot of numbers to keep straight
1csjz5knzw8_5-8-rgb_front let is say you want to dial china
1csjz5knzw8_6-8-rgb_front here is how you do it
1csjz5knzw8_7-8-rgb_front first of all you will dial then that will get you out of the country
1csjz5knzw8_8-8-rgb_front then of course the next number is going to be a country code in this case for china
1csjz5knzw8_9-8-rgb_front then you have a city code
1cuiexb0elm_0-8-rgb_front in this segment of how to cure your slice this is an image that works for a lot of people
1cuiexb0elm_1-8-rgb_front when you slice the ball this is called the heel of the club and the toe of the club
1cuiexb0elm_10-8-rgb_front so when you are looking at your club at address you are looking at that club head no matter what you do get that toe of the club to get to the ball before the heel
1cuiexb0elm_11-8-rgb_front and if you do that you are going to put hook spin on the ball and you are not going to slice anymore
1cuiexb0elm_2-8-rgb_front the inside and the outside
1cuiexb0elm_3-8-rgb_front and if you put slice spin on the ball the inside or heel of the club is actually getting to the ball before it is the toe of the club like this
1cuiexb0elm_4-8-rgb_front the heel is the toe
1cuiexb0elm_5-8-rgb_front the club face opens up and that is what puts slice spin on the ball
1cuiexb0elm_6-8-rgb_front but if you could use the thought during your swing of getting the toe of the club or the outside of the club before the inside or heel of the club that is going to put as you can see hook spin on the ball
1cuiexb0elm_7-8-rgb_front it could be as simple as that
1cuiexb0elm_8-8-rgb_front you are only one swing thought away from hooking the ball and losing your slice and this could be it
1cuiexb0elm_9-8-rgb_front get the toe of the club to get to the ball before the heel
1czmgr3-y6a_0-8-rgb_front i am going to now show you about the stroller and some key components to it so that if you were to buy one you would get the most for your money and for your intentions
1czmgr3-y6a_1-8-rgb_front this is a jogging stroller because it is has three wheels and the wheels are large and for altering activities such as the sand dirt paths but also the cement
1czmgr3-y6a_10-8-rgb_front if something too high it going to put pressure on your shoulders and it is going to make you really tight
1czmgr3-y6a_11-8-rgb_front if it is something to low you are going to have lower back pain and if you are planning to use this a few times a week for one to three miles so you would want it to fit your body
1czmgr3-y6a_2-8-rgb_front they have newer ones that have a swivel front wheel which is nice when you are taking the stroller maybe to the mall or shopping or to the grocery store but most of them the wheel is straight and you will want to have it be locked in if you were running with the stroller
1czmgr3-y6a_3-8-rgb_front this stroller is great for the beach because the wheels are plastic instead of metal spoke and so you do not have to worry about them getting rested because if you are spending money on a stroller you want it to last not just for one kid but probably at least two kids
1czmgr3-y6a_4-8-rgb_front this specific stroller runs about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars and if you want to buy a jogging stroller i would plan to spend at least a hundred and fifty
1czmgr3-y6a_5-8-rgb_front two other components that are important on the jogging stroller is the sun shade so that your little one is covered from the elements
1czmgr3-y6a_6-8-rgb_front some of these have very small sun shades and in that case you end up clipping a blanket to the top of it which is difficult because sometimes that falls off and then if you cover it completely with the blanket then the baby can not see all the wonderful places you are taking them
1czmgr3-y6a_7-8-rgb_front the sun shade is great
1czmgr3-y6a_8-8-rgb_front also for when it is the sun is not in their face it can fold up all the way
1czmgr3-y6a_9-8-rgb_front lastly base on your height and your spouse is height you want to make sure you buy a stroller that fits your body and so you want to have the handle that hits around bright your waist
1czcma6wzeg_1-8-rgb_front now there is another way of doing that
1czcma6wzeg_10-8-rgb_front this is a way of checking the way too if you want to see if it is even
1czcma6wzeg_11-8-rgb_front you can also cut the long layers like this and then go straight across and cut it
1czcma6wzeg_12-8-rgb_front then we also continue to follow that guide and take the next piece over a little bit and into that way and then see but it is even
1czcma6wzeg_13-8-rgb_front that is another way of going ahead and cutting and knowing if you are even or not
1czcma6wzeg_14-8-rgb_front the way to check the hair
1czcma6wzeg_15-8-rgb_front after you cut it straight across you go in another direction and that is the way to check it actually
1czcma6wzeg_16-8-rgb_front you are going to go ahead and do the same thing here
1czcma6wzeg_17-8-rgb_front it will continue to be long
1czcma6wzeg_18-8-rgb_front see that
1czcma6wzeg_19-8-rgb_front i dropped that layer
1czcma6wzeg_2-8-rgb_front notice the layers in the back like i did it
1czcma6wzeg_20-8-rgb_front the layer will drop down and the length will still stay long and she will still have layered hair
1czcma6wzeg_3-8-rgb_front i like to do it like that
1czcma6wzeg_4-8-rgb_front it is a nice way of cutting this layered hair
1czcma6wzeg_5-8-rgb_front if you would like also i have a process that you can do
1czcma6wzeg_6-8-rgb_front a layering that you can actually take the hair in an angle
1czcma6wzeg_7-8-rgb_front this is a we are taught also when we cut hair
1czcma6wzeg_8-8-rgb_front we cut it like this
1czcma6wzeg_9-8-rgb_front notice it is straight across
1cbtn8a73zo_0-5-rgb_front hi i am the star goddess and here is how to figure out what your moon sign is
1cbtn8a73zo_1-5-rgb_front the moon in astrology rules your emotions and feelings
1cbtn8a73zo_10-5-rgb_front so we look down and we see that his sun is in aquarius and his moon sign is gemini which makes him mutable sparkling witty and bright
1cbtn8a73zo_11-5-rgb_front the critical thing about finding a moon sign is remembering that sometimes the moon changes signs during the day because it moves so quickly
1cbtn8a73zo_12-5-rgb_front if you need to figure out what that is you come down to the bottom of the ephemeris on the second part of the page and you will see that it gives the exact moment in time the moon changes from one sign of the zodiac to the other
1cbtn8a73zo_13-5-rgb_front so now you know what your moon sign is
1cbtn8a73zo_14-5-rgb_front you can get a better understanding of what your wants and needs are and what you need to do to get those needs met
1cbtn8a73zo_15-5-rgb_front so that is better living through astrology
1cbtn8a73zo_16-5-rgb_front i am janet sciales the star goddess
1cbtn8a73zo_2-5-rgb_front it is a very important planet and because it moves one degree every two hours it changes signs every two and a half days
1cbtn8a73zo_3-5-rgb_front the only way to calculate your moon sign is with an ephemeris the table of planetary motion
1cbtn8a73zo_4-5-rgb_front it is done by the jet propulsion lab and it chronicles the minute movements of each one of the twelve planets each one of the ten planets and through each one of the twelve signs
1cbtn8a73zo_5-5-rgb_front the way you figure it out is you pick a date
1cbtn8a73zo_6-5-rgb_front mat our producer is born on february first nineteen eighty five
1cbtn8a73zo_7-5-rgb_front so we turn to nineteen eighty five we look at the month of february
1cbtn8a73zo_8-5-rgb_front the left hand side are the days of the week across the top are the ten different planets
1cbtn8a73zo_9-5-rgb_front the first one is the sun the second two are the moon
1cj15is-wjs_0-8-rgb_front hi i am tim gipson
1cj15is-wjs_1-8-rgb_front i am going to talk to you about how to tune up a bandsaw
1cj15is-wjs_10-8-rgb_front so in this case we can see we have got the proper amount of tension
1cj15is-wjs_11-8-rgb_front okay
1cj15is-wjs_12-8-rgb_front next thing we want to do is we want to make sure that the blade is running on the rollers correctly
1cj15is-wjs_13-8-rgb_front so if we open this door then we have the rollers right here
1cj15is-wjs_14-8-rgb_front and what you want to make sure is you want to make sure the blade is running right on the inside
1cj15is-wjs_15-8-rgb_front now if it is not then we can make the adjustment and that would be back here
1cj15is-wjs_16-8-rgb_front in tuning up keeping our bandsaw working good is to check our base and to make sure that it is perpendicular to the blade
1cj15is-wjs_17-8-rgb_front and in that case we can use a right angle such as this to come in and to check the blade against that
1cj15is-wjs_18-8-rgb_front and then we have adjustments on our table
1cj15is-wjs_19-8-rgb_front then finally and it is very important to make sure that the blade stays the right orientation is that we have our blocks that are in here
1cj15is-wjs_2-8-rgb_front now the most important thing with a bandsaw is definitely we want to make sure that we have got the right tension on the blade so that it keeps it at the appropriate angle to the table that we are trying achieve
1cj15is-wjs_20-8-rgb_front and these are either phenolic blocks or hardwood blocks that are to each side of the blade
1cj15is-wjs_21-8-rgb_front and that keeps that blade from moving back and forth as you are cutting
1cj15is-wjs_22-8-rgb_front and so as those wear down over time you will want to make sure that you cut new blocks to keep that in there
1cj15is-wjs_23-8-rgb_front so i am tim gipson and that is how to tune up a bandsaw
1cj15is-wjs_3-8-rgb_front now to keep the right tension on most of your bandsaws will come with a device such as this
1cj15is-wjs_4-8-rgb_front now you have various widths of band that you can put on of your blades
1cj15is-wjs_5-8-rgb_front in this particular case we have got a quarter inch blade
1cj15is-wjs_6-8-rgb_front so you have a tension device back here which has a spring with a red mark on it
1cj15is-wjs_7-8-rgb_front so in this case we want to make sure that this tension is set so that that red mark on that spring is right at the marking on here
1cj15is-wjs_8-8-rgb_front now another way we can check that is when we move our foot out of the way here we could also press and check the deflection
1cj15is-wjs_9-8-rgb_front and we want to have less than a quarter of an inch of deflection
1cp9sjt_1tc_0-8-rgb_front kirk vickers the next exercise the next core exercise that we are going to do is called the butterfly
1cp9sjt_1tc_1-8-rgb_front we are going to go back into our position
1cp9sjt_1tc_10-8-rgb_front come back watch
1cp9sjt_1tc_11-8-rgb_front i feel my back arching i force it back down come back up
1cp9sjt_1tc_2-8-rgb_front you will notice that we do a lot of movement out of this position a very important position to develop and bring in those small deep muscles within the body
1cp9sjt_1tc_3-8-rgb_front what we are going to do now keep the low back flat and we are going to go into a butterfly position
1cp9sjt_1tc_4-8-rgb_front letting that leg open up we are going to call in some of the deep inner thigh muscles as well as trying to keep that low back flat
1cp9sjt_1tc_5-8-rgb_front the key here is do not make the movement easy
1cp9sjt_1tc_6-8-rgb_front try to keep that low back flat
1cp9sjt_1tc_7-8-rgb_front that is going to put you into a lot more tension and a lot more stress through the area that we are trying to work but that is what we are trying to develop even if you only do a few
1cp9sjt_1tc_8-8-rgb_front we will go one leg and then the other leg each time forcing our low back down belly button to spine low back flat
1cp9sjt_1tc_9-8-rgb_front toes are up take it as wide we can get some stretch through the inner thigh so we are working several things with one movement and one exercise
1d1uwuuhjzq_0-3-rgb_front hi
1d1uwuuhjzq_1-3-rgb_front my name is monique richards
1d1uwuuhjzq_2-3-rgb_front i am an instructor at school house yoga

1d3uapdr58m_0-8-rgb_front hi i am emily larew
1d3uapdr58m_1-8-rgb_front we are now going to combine your six step going to all four corners with a freeze
1d3uapdr58m_10-8-rgb_front now i am going to face the back five six
1d3uapdr58m_11-8-rgb_front and that is how i turn
1d3uapdr58m_12-8-rgb_front again
1d3uapdr58m_13-8-rgb_front one two three four what are we going to do
1d3uapdr58m_14-8-rgb_front change on five
1d3uapdr58m_15-8-rgb_front five six
1d3uapdr58m_16-8-rgb_front and again one two three four turn five six
1d3uapdr58m_17-8-rgb_front from here is where we are going to break it down and on the fourth step get into our freeze
1d3uapdr58m_18-8-rgb_front so we are back to the front
1d3uapdr58m_19-8-rgb_front we just did the four corners
1d3uapdr58m_2-8-rgb_front so we have already learned our basic six step in the previous segment
1d3uapdr58m_20-8-rgb_front you go one two three four
1d3uapdr58m_21-8-rgb_front from here put your hand down
1d3uapdr58m_22-8-rgb_front you are going to tip over and back up into your freeze
1d3uapdr58m_23-8-rgb_front seven eight
1d3uapdr58m_24-8-rgb_front and then back down
1d3uapdr58m_25-8-rgb_front and you can start the whole thing again which we are going to do right now
1d3uapdr58m_26-8-rgb_front ready
1d3uapdr58m_27-8-rgb_front here we go
1d3uapdr58m_28-8-rgb_front so we have got one two three four five six
1d3uapdr58m_29-8-rgb_front one two three four five six
1d3uapdr58m_3-8-rgb_front so we are down
1d3uapdr58m_30-8-rgb_front one two three four five six
1d3uapdr58m_31-8-rgb_front back to the front three four five six
1d3uapdr58m_32-8-rgb_front one more three four up hold
1d3uapdr58m_33-8-rgb_front there you go
1d3uapdr58m_34-8-rgb_front and that is your six step all four corners with a freeze
1d3uapdr58m_4-8-rgb_front what is going to happen is is how you turn this is you are going to turn on your fourth step
1d3uapdr58m_5-8-rgb_front so this is one two three four
1d3uapdr58m_6-8-rgb_front now what we are going to do is on five six turn and face the first corner
1d3uapdr58m_7-8-rgb_front five six
1d3uapdr58m_8-8-rgb_front repeat it to this side
1d3uapdr58m_9-8-rgb_front one two three four
1d5avouqauq_0-8-rgb_front well if a person has type one diabetes then the main focus is for them to eat enough calories and carbohydrates to maintain their weight
1d5avouqauq_1-8-rgb_front and so we teach people with type on diabetes to count their carbohydrates but not necessarily to restrict carbohydrates
1d5avouqauq_10-8-rgb_front and then a fourth of their plate with the foods that are high in carbohydrates like potatoes rice corn dry beans peas and noodles and then a fourth of the plate with their meat
1d5avouqauq_11-8-rgb_front and when they eat that way they naturally reduce calories often without even having to measure their portions out
1d5avouqauq_12-8-rgb_front so that is kind of the first step is to really get people to consume a lot more of those vegetables that are high fiber high water content and very low on carbohydrates
1d5avouqauq_2-8-rgb_front and sometimes people with type one get confused because they see a lot of messages in the media about cutting carbohydrates and actually that would cause them to lose too much weight
1d5avouqauq_3-8-rgb_front on the other hand someone with type two diabetes generally is overweight and so they need to cut carbohydrates as well as the calories in their diets
1d5avouqauq_4-8-rgb_front so generally when someone has type two diabetes we try to help them reduce the total calorie intake
1d5avouqauq_5-8-rgb_front and that includes calories from all foods and so portions are going to be smaller particularly are foods that are high in fat and carbohydrate
1d5avouqauq_6-8-rgb_front in general we try to encourage people with type two diabetes to increase their intake of vegetables that are low in sugar and fat
1d5avouqauq_7-8-rgb_front and those are your broccoli green beans cauliflower onions lettuce salad type greens all of those vegetables that have a lot of fiber in them fill you up without giving you too much energy
1d5avouqauq_8-8-rgb_front and so the big focus for somebody who has type two diabetes is to fill half of their plate at dinner time with those that we call free foods
1d5avouqauq_9-8-rgb_front they do not even have to portion them out
1dcbeg4mwvk_0-8-rgb_front welcome to my studio today my name is lars erik robinson
1dcbeg4mwvk_1-8-rgb_front my name is lars arts all around
1dcbeg4mwvk_10-8-rgb_front try to leave the tops of the white and then we will take a dark green
1dcbeg4mwvk_11-8-rgb_front so an overcap of how you can do mountains
1dcbeg4mwvk_12-8-rgb_front always try to think about where the sun is hitting it and create the other side of it
1dcbeg4mwvk_13-8-rgb_front maybe like a blueish green on that side take your brush again go down with streaks like that it will create the crevices in the mountain
1dcbeg4mwvk_14-8-rgb_front clouds up there if you want to create atmosphere in the sky take your blue and clouds again all right
1dcbeg4mwvk_15-8-rgb_front i hope that gives you all an idea of how to do mountains
1dcbeg4mwvk_16-8-rgb_front keep on painting
1dcbeg4mwvk_17-8-rgb_front go out there and make those landscapes and do those mountains
1dcbeg4mwvk_18-8-rgb_front thank you so much
1dcbeg4mwvk_19-8-rgb_front bye now
1dcbeg4mwvk_2-8-rgb_front i am a freelance illustrator
1dcbeg4mwvk_3-8-rgb_front today we are going to talk about how to draw mountains
1dcbeg4mwvk_4-8-rgb_front i one here with little ink lines here how to show how to do it with watercolor
1dcbeg4mwvk_5-8-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and get the gray blue onto my brush
1dcbeg4mwvk_6-8-rgb_front by doing that you take a little blue maybe take a little part green and never try to use black because when you use black it really tends to muddy it so try to mix it in with some colors
1dcbeg4mwvk_7-8-rgb_front we will take the side of our brush here and try to get that if the sun is coming from this way we will get the shadow part of the mountain
1dcbeg4mwvk_8-8-rgb_front so it is kind of like a greenish blue color that you want to create cause it creates that stone
1dcbeg4mwvk_9-8-rgb_front from the other end it could be more you can try to get the yellow part of it of the sun hitting it on that side
1dfd3nykinq_0-8-rgb_front these are my kilns
1dfd3nykinq_1-8-rgb_front this kiln is a really huge one and because my work is so little i do not fire it
1dfd3nykinq_10-8-rgb_front and i turn it up to medium and fire it for another hour
1dfd3nykinq_11-8-rgb_front all this time this lid is shut down
1dfd3nykinq_12-8-rgb_front and then i turn it on high for an hour
1dfd3nykinq_13-8-rgb_front and after an hour i plug up the peep hole and it will just go for anywhere from three to six hours longer depending on how much green ware is in your kiln
1dfd3nykinq_14-8-rgb_front or how old your elements are
1dfd3nykinq_15-8-rgb_front because as the elements get older it takes longer to fire
1dfd3nykinq_16-8-rgb_front i have a head that i fired inside the kiln
1dfd3nykinq_17-8-rgb_front it s sitting on a bed of what is called prop pet
1dfd3nykinq_18-8-rgb_front this is kind of like asbestos like material
1dfd3nykinq_19-8-rgb_front the shoulder plate i have the prop pet stuffed inside because if i just had it in the kiln like this when it gets hot it would tend to want to close down and break at the shoulders
1dfd3nykinq_2-8-rgb_front this one fires on two twenty but this is a small electric kiln that actually fires on household current
1dfd3nykinq_20-8-rgb_front so i put this cottony prop pet stuff inside to support it during the firing
1dfd3nykinq_21-8-rgb_front when it goes in its white in color and very chalky and very fragile
1dfd3nykinq_22-8-rgb_front and then this it comes out of the kiln with this color
1dfd3nykinq_23-8-rgb_front as i mentioned earlier the porcelain slip has the color in it
1dfd3nykinq_3-8-rgb_front the way that a kiln works is that it pours and fires to a temperature of o cone six which is around twenty six hundred degrees
1dfd3nykinq_4-8-rgb_front so i use one of these little bars which are called a cone and when it gets to the proper temperature this little bar inside will melt
1dfd3nykinq_5-8-rgb_front i put it in i put the cone in like this into the cone cone holder and this little switch goes back and forth
1dfd3nykinq_6-8-rgb_front and when this melts it will then trigger this latch to go to go down and turn the kiln off automatically
1dfd3nykinq_7-8-rgb_front i put my porcelain in and i turn it on low for about an hour with this is called a peep hole
1dfd3nykinq_8-8-rgb_front and the peep hole needs to be unplugged when you first start up on your kiln
1dfd3nykinq_9-8-rgb_front and i fire it for about an hour on low
1djbyumwpsy_1-8-rgb_front we learned in our class something called well we call it the pat maneuver a lapd officer pat bailey one our mentors thought us how to do this and we share this with parents because we found this the easiest way to install the seat
1djbyumwpsy_10-8-rgb_front you can also notice because there is leather in this vehicle that we use a piece of non sticky material to help keep it from sliding around
1djbyumwpsy_11-8-rgb_front we have also because of the seat lopes in the vehicle using a pool noodle to adjust for angle
1djbyumwpsy_12-8-rgb_front the most important part is in installing a infant or parenting me a convertible seat is to make sure you have a degree angle for a infant that does not have full head control or neck control
1djbyumwpsy_13-8-rgb_front if it is a child that has head control the angle does not need to be quiet in could be a little more steep
1djbyumwpsy_14-8-rgb_front but you never ever would want it in a like this
1djbyumwpsy_15-8-rgb_front so what andrea and pat though us to do would be to use your body to weight the sit i can reach down here and pull through this way like this and then i can rock the sit like this when i am pulling in order to get it tight
1djbyumwpsy_16-8-rgb_front i have also dan have switched the belt we need a locking magnetism and dan is pulling the belt and we are rocking the sit side to side
1djbyumwpsy_17-8-rgb_front then it feeds up in the magnetism the belt is locked and when you try to move the sit you always check your sit for installation at the belt path and when you try to move it side to side it is not moving and that is the proper way to install
1djbyumwpsy_18-8-rgb_front so the easies way to do this is with our pat maneuver by climbing up in the sit and rocking it and getting it nice and tight
1djbyumwpsy_2-8-rgb_front so the first thing pat thought use was to move th front seat all the way forward and get it out of the way
1djbyumwpsy_3-8-rgb_front and doing this could be a little harder in smaller vehicle but it still could be done
1djbyumwpsy_4-8-rgb_front the second thing we want to do is to make sure that there is nothing on the floor so when we get in here cause we are going to have to stand here so you want to have the floors empty
1djbyumwpsy_5-8-rgb_front okay third thing is now you are going to climb in to the seat
1djbyumwpsy_6-8-rgb_front get in
1djbyumwpsy_7-8-rgb_front okay we have already run this through the belt path convertibles has two belt paths on of them is a rear facing belt path right here when it is in this position
1djbyumwpsy_8-8-rgb_front the forward facing belt path is right here so if the seat was turned around facing this way you would then use this belt path
1djbyumwpsy_9-8-rgb_front but since we are facing when you run the lap shoulder belt through here and the seat still moves around and it is still loose
1dlchy8r6tu_0-8-rgb_front in this segment i am going to talk about single whip
1dlchy8r6tu_1-8-rgb_front this is the signature movement of tai chi and according to some of my teachers the most important movement of tai chi
1dlchy8r6tu_10-8-rgb_front so stand a little bit to the left pushing with the back leg when you get beyond halfway you turn the hips and open the arms outward
1dlchy8r6tu_11-8-rgb_front the left hand ends up facing degrees forward
1dlchy8r6tu_12-8-rgb_front so not all the way here not here degrees forward
1dlchy8r6tu_13-8-rgb_front this being your striking surface
1dlchy8r6tu_14-8-rgb_front the right hand the wrist is pushing up and out the shoulder is open being vertical
1dlchy8r6tu_15-8-rgb_front so we are going out in this direction going out in this direction going out in this direction
1dlchy8r6tu_16-8-rgb_front so it is a very extended movement
1dlchy8r6tu_17-8-rgb_front being mindful not to tighten the back shoulder
1dlchy8r6tu_18-8-rgb_front just go outward with every single limb
1dlchy8r6tu_2-8-rgb_front so beginning from push we are going to in the yang style turn around degrees
1dlchy8r6tu_3-8-rgb_front so we turn on the heel let the arms follow there are variations to this
1dlchy8r6tu_4-8-rgb_front shift back turn on the toe lifting the heel
1dlchy8r6tu_5-8-rgb_front we draw the foot back drawing the hands back across the body forming a crane is beak of hook with our right hand
1dlchy8r6tu_6-8-rgb_front the most common error i see here is that people draw the hands into the body crushing the egg inside of their armpit
1dlchy8r6tu_7-8-rgb_front so we bring the hands across the body
1dlchy8r6tu_8-8-rgb_front if you need to turn the hip a little bit because what we need to do here is to step to the left a little bit
1dlchy8r6tu_9-8-rgb_front if you do not step to the left you will be standing on a narrow board
1dd1iikj-mu_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to do our center elbow drill as a warm up for israeli martial arts
1dd1iikj-mu_1-8-rgb_front so here we are in our guarding stance again our left foot is forward if we are
1dd1iikj-mu_10-8-rgb_front so what is going to happen is that fist is either going to hit my elbow and do damage to the fist or it is going to slide off in one direction or the other
1dd1iikj-mu_2-8-rgb_front my hands are up
1dd1iikj-mu_3-8-rgb_front a punch is coming in i do not have time to block or react
1dd1iikj-mu_4-8-rgb_front my only quick reaction is here
1dd1iikj-mu_5-8-rgb_front okay
1dd1iikj-mu_6-8-rgb_front we call it a center elbow
1dd1iikj-mu_7-8-rgb_front what we do is we come straight up
1dd1iikj-mu_8-8-rgb_front i put my bicep into my left eye
1dd1iikj-mu_9-8-rgb_front cover up grabbing the top of my head leaving my elbow out
1dpraxotfzs_0-8-rgb_front hi
1dpraxotfzs_1-8-rgb_front i am michael burton and we are talking about choosing a wedding videographer for your wedding day
1dpraxotfzs_10-8-rgb_front but that is a good sign that we are you know that we are keeping busy and that we do good work
1dpraxotfzs_11-8-rgb_front other things to keep in mind in your contract are to make sure they put in there how many dvds you are going to get or if you can buy raw footage
1dpraxotfzs_12-8-rgb_front that is an important thing to discuss with your videographer before hand and make sure you put that in the contract if you can buy raw footage at end
1dpraxotfzs_13-8-rgb_front how much he is going to charge you and also how many dvds you are going to get and if you are allowed to make copies of that
1dpraxotfzs_14-8-rgb_front that should all be included in the contract so that you are not coming back later after your wedding day saying hey i need this this and this and he is saying no you can not do that or no i will not do that
1dpraxotfzs_2-8-rgb_front one important thing that you should do with your wedding videographer when you are booking your wedding is to make sure that you guys sign a contract together
1dpraxotfzs_3-8-rgb_front that is important for both sides because you need to know exactly what is expected of each other
1dpraxotfzs_4-8-rgb_front the videographer needs to know that you are not going to back out and that you are not going to change your wedding day
1dpraxotfzs_5-8-rgb_front and you need to know that your videographer is going to be there or your wedding day especially if you do not talk to him for another month or two or a few weeks depending on how early you book
1dpraxotfzs_6-8-rgb_front so that you make sure that they have got to be there
1dpraxotfzs_7-8-rgb_front they have got a legally binding contract that says they have got to be there
1dpraxotfzs_8-8-rgb_front another important thing to have put into your contract with your videographer is an estimated completion date of when your video is going to be finished
1dpraxotfzs_9-8-rgb_front i know with our company we put around six months as a completion date because we are so busy that a lot of times when we are out shooting and we do not have a lot of time to get the editing done
1e2wdf5r_zk_0-8-rgb_front hi this is jorge benllach i am a sculptor and i am here today because i am going to try to show you how to do like a boat with some kind of fishermans on and a big fish
1e2wdf5r_zk_1-8-rgb_front it is like a caricature of this you know the poor fisherman that tried to make the big one to catch the big one
1e2wdf5r_zk_10-8-rgb_front later i will tell you that this cannot be there when it dry off
1e2wdf5r_zk_11-8-rgb_front we have to take it off
1e2wdf5r_zk_12-8-rgb_front that is why i am going to wrap with paper
1e2wdf5r_zk_13-8-rgb_front and you will see
1e2wdf5r_zk_2-8-rgb_front it is like me i am i am a i am a fisherman that is why i know
1e2wdf5r_zk_3-8-rgb_front and ah you know i am a boat owner too
1e2wdf5r_zk_4-8-rgb_front i know what i am talking about
1e2wdf5r_zk_5-8-rgb_front anyway it is going to be a very interesting and fun figurine that you can make it for some kind of for your parents for some friends and you can personalize also putting some kind of objects or making like a caricature of a of the two characters that i am going to put in there
1e2wdf5r_zk_6-8-rgb_front this is going to be like a basic exaggerated and caricature boat with a with two fishermans on it and one big fish
1e2wdf5r_zk_7-8-rgb_front the materials that we are going to use they are clay and i am going to use the gray one
1e2wdf5r_zk_8-8-rgb_front and not many tools one base one string to cut the clay these two pieces of wood in order to make the slabs even a roller pin and maybe this pick in order to make some cuttings
1e2wdf5r_zk_9-8-rgb_front and probably this piece of policspan in order to make like a support of the base in order to avoid the boat collapse
1ea1ci1yi7w_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about the proper way to remove and replace worn front brake hoses on a nineteen ford explorer
1ea1ci1yi7w_1-8-rgb_front in this step we are going to talk about types of brake fluid and the proper way to fill your vehicles master cylinder
1ea1ci1yi7w_10-8-rgb_front if you are done bleeding the brakes the fluid level in a master cylinder is going to be relatively depleted
1ea1ci1yi7w_11-8-rgb_front which will sink the sensor and turn on your red brake light
1ea1ci1yi7w_12-8-rgb_front you want to make sure to top off your master cylinder after you bleed your brakes
1ea1ci1yi7w_13-8-rgb_front go ahead and take and fill it up
1ea1ci1yi7w_14-8-rgb_front it is possible for these floats to get stuck
1ea1ci1yi7w_15-8-rgb_front so you are going to want to keep an eye on it and make sure that it comes up to the appropriate level
1ea1ci1yi7w_16-8-rgb_front if it is not moving tap the side of it and your float will come up for you
1ea1ci1yi7w_17-8-rgb_front as you can see the float came up right there
1ea1ci1yi7w_18-8-rgb_front that is the level sensor
1ea1ci1yi7w_19-8-rgb_front can you see that
1ea1ci1yi7w_2-8-rgb_front what you are looking at here this is
1ea1ci1yi7w_20-8-rgb_front see how it comes up
1ea1ci1yi7w_21-8-rgb_front that triggers the system it will turn the red brake light on if your fluid level is low
1ea1ci1yi7w_22-8-rgb_front right there is plenty of fluid
1ea1ci1yi7w_23-8-rgb_front let me go ahead and take and put my master cylinder cap back on
1ea1ci1yi7w_24-8-rgb_front that is the different types of brake fluid and the proper way to fill your master cylinder
1ea1ci1yi7w_3-8-rgb_front that is department of transportation spec level
1ea1ci1yi7w_4-8-rgb_front they also have four and five you are going to want to refer to your vehicles owner is manual for the particular fluid recommended by the manufacturer
1ea1ci1yi7w_5-8-rgb_front is the most common and it is recommended by ford for the explorer
1ea1ci1yi7w_6-8-rgb_front this is your vehicles master cylinder
1ea1ci1yi7w_7-8-rgb_front it will have a level on it for minimum and maximum fills
1ea1ci1yi7w_8-8-rgb_front you can see this line right here it says max
1ea1ci1yi7w_9-8-rgb_front that is as full as they want it
1eczlifdh2o_0-8-rgb_front next part of our seated asanas or postures is navasana or a boat pose
1eczlifdh2o_1-8-rgb_front and you may have seen this in other exercise programs pilates and things like that
1eczlifdh2o_10-8-rgb_front so find the fullest expression for you and go only to that point and then that will go into engaging the core rather than pulling into your back or any other part of your body
1eczlifdh2o_11-8-rgb_front and that is navasana or boat pose
1eczlifdh2o_2-8-rgb_front so what you will do is come to a seated position and then you will slightly rock back on to your sacrum
1eczlifdh2o_3-8-rgb_front as you come back on to your sacrum you can use your hands at first if you want if you are just starting out or use your hands behind your legs
1eczlifdh2o_4-8-rgb_front so what you will do is you will bring your legs up
1eczlifdh2o_5-8-rgb_front for beginners you want to go to about a ninety degree angle and let your arms reach out towards the wall in front of you
1eczlifdh2o_6-8-rgb_front for a more advanced student you can slowly straighten one leg and then the other
1eczlifdh2o_7-8-rgb_front so you bring yourself out engage the core and reach energy out from your fingers and if you are shaking like i just was then you want to come to a more bent position
1eczlifdh2o_8-8-rgb_front and then you can try again challenge yourself
1eczlifdh2o_9-8-rgb_front if you have tight hip flexors tight hamstrings or any tightness in your lower back it will be hard to straighten your legs
1efldhpjpni_0-8-rgb_front to start with you have to determine who is going to serve first
1efldhpjpni_1-8-rgb_front you can say to the opponent m or w
1efldhpjpni_10-8-rgb_front the reason for that is one side is usually much sunnier than the other side
1efldhpjpni_2_3_4_5-8-rgb_front and just spin that racket it is w so whomever chose w will serve first scoring is very important zero means the same as love so you can start with saying zero zero
1efldhpjpni_6-8-rgb_front or love love
1efldhpjpni_7-8-rgb_front the first point is fifteen the second point is thirty the third point is forty and then to win the game you have to win another point
1efldhpjpni_8-8-rgb_front if the ball touches just even a little bit of the line and it touches a little bit of the outside of the line it is in
1efldhpjpni_9-8-rgb_front on every odd game you switch sides
1egsa8j2kko_0-8-rgb_front the next game we are going to talk about is called lazy pineapple
1egsa8j2kko_1-8-rgb_front lazy pineapple is one of three variations of the game pineapple
1egsa8j2kko_10-8-rgb_front the betting round starts again with the player to the left of the dealer
1egsa8j2kko_11-8-rgb_front once that betting round is over the dealer will burn a card and turn the fourth card to the community called the flop
1egsa8j2kko_12-8-rgb_front i am sorry that is called the turn
1egsa8j2kko_13-8-rgb_front the betting round will start with the player to the left of the dealer and once that betting round is over the dealer will burn a card and turn the last card to the community called the river
1egsa8j2kko_14-8-rgb_front in lazy pineapple the best hand wins
1egsa8j2kko_15-8-rgb_front so the players will turn their cards over using their best five cards from their two hole cards and the five community cards to make their best hand
1egsa8j2kko_16-8-rgb_front and that is how lazy pineapple is played
1egsa8j2kko_2-8-rgb_front lazy pineapple is dealt out just like pineapple with each player receiving three down cards
1egsa8j2kko_3-8-rgb_front however in lazy pineapple the players will discard their card after the flop
1egsa8j2kko_4-8-rgb_front let is see how lazy pineapple is dealt out
1egsa8j2kko_5-8-rgb_front each player receives three down cards from the dealer
1egsa8j2kko_6-8-rgb_front once these three cards are dealt out to each player a betting round will start with the player to the left of the dealer
1egsa8j2kko_7-8-rgb_front once that betting round is over the dealer will burn a card and turn the first three cards to the community called the flop
1egsa8j2kko_8-8-rgb_front since this is lazy pineapple this is where each player will look at their hand and make a decision to fold a card
1egsa8j2kko_9-8-rgb_front once each player has folded a card from their hand this leaves him with two hole cards and a betting round starts
1ejmq87wk94_0-3-rgb_front remember in using a backhoe sometimes jobs may be from place to place
1ejmq87wk94_1-3-rgb_front so you might have a need to drive a backhoe from one job to another
1ejmq87wk94_10-3-rgb_front so when you mash your foot both brakes will apply
1ejmq87wk94_11-3-rgb_front if you make the mistake and mash one brake on the highway it may cause you to drift over into other lanes or toward the ditch
1ejmq87wk94_12-3-rgb_front so make sure both brakes are locked so you will have equal braking on both sides
1ejmq87wk94_2-3-rgb_front including on the state highway
1ejmq87wk94_3-3-rgb_front okay remember before you drive a backhoe on the public highway make sure all your safety items are in tact
1ejmq87wk94_4-3-rgb_front including lights flashers make sure all your safety pins like boon lock the rear swing lock make sure all those items are in tact
1ejmq87wk94_5-3-rgb_front make sure your bucket is down low where you have good visibility
1ejmq87wk94_6-3-rgb_front four wheel drive is disengaged
1ejmq87wk94_7-3-rgb_front you do not need four wheel drive on a highway
1ejmq87wk94_8-3-rgb_front so when you are traveling down a highway make sure all the safety factors you can think of is in place
1ejmq87wk94_9-3-rgb_front remember in highway travel always make sure your brake lock is in place
1ezfir9onzo_0-8-rgb_front we are going to continue with the diagonal game from the forehand side
1ezfir9onzo_1-8-rgb_front i am going to restart the drill and then gary and i of course will be taking turns in the backcourt
1ezfir9onzo_2-8-rgb_front so when you are in the backcourt you have the option of hitting a straight drive or of hitting a boast so the purpose of hitting this drill is when the player in the backcourt has the option of hitting the boast it forces the other player to defend the tee because if they are too far back when you throw a boast at them that could become a winner if they are too far back so watch what the backcourt player does and how they prepare how they get the racquet ready how they turn how they hit the ball against the side wall
1ezfir9onzo_3-8-rgb_front so notice that i hit a good boast i am able to hit the ball down the wall now and gary counters with a good boast and now he works me into the back corner and now i get my chance to attack
1ezfir9onzo_4-8-rgb_front he is working me in the front and now i get a chance for a length another length
1ezfir9onzo_5-8-rgb_front so that is the diagonal game and you can see it is very vigorous and it really trains you to hit all the shots you need to hit
1ed8dw0kou8_10-8-rgb_front again what i am attempting to do here is get the heart rate up and it is working or i can just take it lift from side to side
1ed8dw0kou8_11-8-rgb_front so that is my move called over the top and again it is used for cardiovascular endurance exercise
1ed8dw0kou8_3-8-rgb_front so i am going to start on the side step to the center of the bosu and step down to the other side
1ed8dw0kou8_9-8-rgb_front and i can elevate in the center or move it faster a little syncopation
1ei1kvtw23a_0-8-rgb_front the next combination we are going to work on our introductory boxing lesson i teach all the new students a
1ei1kvtw23a_1-8-rgb_front we call it a
1ei1kvtw23a_10-8-rgb_front okay
1ei1kvtw23a_11-8-rgb_front that is pretty easy to do because basically that is just a small target and the coat hanger is flushed up against the bag
1ei1kvtw23a_12-8-rgb_front but what i want to do now is is as i move the coat hanger out to about halfway what i want to make sure is that they are also not hitting the outside of this coat hanger like nick was showing
1ei1kvtw23a_13-8-rgb_front if you are too looping you are going to hit the outside of the coat hanger and that is what we do not want
1ei1kvtw23a_14-8-rgb_front now he is going to do it in
1ei1kvtw23a_15-8-rgb_front he is going to hit all three punches
1ei1kvtw23a_16-8-rgb_front halfway to the target he is going to still be on target by hitting halfway through this coat hanger
1ei1kvtw23a_17-8-rgb_front okay nick
1ei1kvtw23a_18-8-rgb_front
1ei1kvtw23a_19-8-rgb_front see now we have got all three punches going through the coat hanger right to the target
1ei1kvtw23a_2-8-rgb_front what i try to instill upon them is that as you step in and throw your first punch okay you are throwing your second punch you are turning your body the right hand does not have to be of your power
1ei1kvtw23a_20-8-rgb_front try it again nick
1ei1kvtw23a_21-8-rgb_front slow motion
1ei1kvtw23a_22-8-rgb_front and that is what we want is nice straight punches
1ei1kvtw23a_23-8-rgb_front so nick go ahead and try that on the heavy bag
1ei1kvtw23a_24-8-rgb_front that is great
1ei1kvtw23a_25-8-rgb_front there we have the
1ei1kvtw23a_26-8-rgb_front all nice and tight
1ei1kvtw23a_27-8-rgb_front all nice and long punches
1ei1kvtw23a_28-8-rgb_front we will look at hooks later on
1ei1kvtw23a_29-8-rgb_front thank you
1ei1kvtw23a_3-8-rgb_front you are merely turning your body so that you can get the second left jab turned with your body and then you can deliver a much more powerful left jab
1ei1kvtw23a_4-8-rgb_front but what i also want is rather than big open wide looping punches we want to try to keep everything nice and tight so that you are firing from the center of your shoulders you are firing from the center of your body
1ei1kvtw23a_5-8-rgb_front that way your punches are nice and tight
1ei1kvtw23a_6-8-rgb_front you are firing from your cheek you are firing from you chin
1ei1kvtw23a_7-8-rgb_front everything is nice and tight

1ey34szkysq_0-8-rgb_front the next pose in our upper body strengthening and toning asana sequence is side plank
1ey34szkysq_1-8-rgb_front pretty self explanatory from the name
1ey34szkysq_10-8-rgb_front shifting to the other side right hand down left hand up
1ey34szkysq_11-8-rgb_front see if you can come through each side a couple of times
1ey34szkysq_12-8-rgb_front remember when you are here to not let your hips break stay solid through your core and let your breath flow
1ey34szkysq_13-8-rgb_front breath is key in this pose
1ey34szkysq_14-8-rgb_front inhaling and exhaling keep those breaths long and strong coming in and out through the nose filling all the way down to the bottom of the belly pushing all the air out on every exhale
1ey34szkysq_15-8-rgb_front breathe and flow
1ey34szkysq_2-8-rgb_front if you know what plank pose is it is your basic push up position
1ey34szkysq_3-8-rgb_front you have got your wrist right under your shoulders and your body is in a straight line from your heels to the crown of your head
1ey34szkysq_4-8-rgb_front so to come into side plank what you are going to do is say if i am going to come into my i am going to bring my right side up and my left side down right
1ey34szkysq_5-8-rgb_front so i am going to bring that left hand a little bit over to kind of the middle
1ey34szkysq_6-8-rgb_front i am going to start to shift my hips and let them open across the front
1ey34szkysq_7-8-rgb_front i am going to let this arm rise
1ey34szkysq_8-8-rgb_front my feet are stacked
1ey34szkysq_9-8-rgb_front i am not like this and i am not like this i am still in that straight line of my head all the way down through my heels
1f-aw3mq894_1-8-rgb_front okay as you can see the garlic is starting to brown i like to swirl it around a little bit it evenly distributes the heat in the pan so everything browns altogether and you get more consistency in our flavors and how they develop with the other ingredients
1f-aw3mq894_2-8-rgb_front now as pay very particular attention to the garlic i do not want it to brown because it does create a more bitter flavor to you ingredients you really want to avoid that
1f-aw3mq894_3-8-rgb_front now my next step when i add the cherry to it which is the cream cherry it is actually going to stop the cooking process so i can wait until the garlic is fairly brown
1f-aw3mq894_4-8-rgb_front i like to do things by eye because i have done this receipt so much that i know that
1f-aw3mq894_5-8-rgb_front i do not like to make this to brown because it is going to add a brown color to my sauce so i see right here that it is perfect where i want it
1f-aw3mq894_6-8-rgb_front i am going to add my cream cherry we are going to cook that off
1f6mti3qidq_1-8-rgb_front i am going to show you some cheer leading squad cheers today
1f6mti3qidq_10-8-rgb_front you do not want them directly next to you
1f6mti3qidq_11-8-rgb_front we definitely do not want to see them behind you because that does not look as anesthetically pleasing to the eye
1f6mti3qidq_12-8-rgb_front so now that we have learned our v is we can do a few variations on them
1f6mti3qidq_13-8-rgb_front we can do either a right v
1f6mti3qidq_14-8-rgb_front you can do a left v
1f6mti3qidq_15-8-rgb_front so you can definitely use those a lot in your cheers
1f6mti3qidq_16-8-rgb_front the second motion to master is a t
1f6mti3qidq_17-8-rgb_front a t is going to be similar to your v however your arms are going to be straight out
1f6mti3qidq_18-8-rgb_front again we want to make sure they are right out of our peripheral vision
1f6mti3qidq_19-8-rgb_front we do not want them to the back or to the side
1f6mti3qidq_2-8-rgb_front we are going to talk about chants and i am going to demonstrate some that you can take to your squad
1f6mti3qidq_20-8-rgb_front now that we have learned a t another basic movement is the goal post
1f6mti3qidq_21-8-rgb_front with the goal post it is very really important to remember not to keep your shoulders up shrugged next to your head but to keep them down and relaxed
1f6mti3qidq_22-8-rgb_front and we want to make sure that our arms are as close to touching our ears as possible
1f6mti3qidq_23-8-rgb_front so we want to keep our goal post nice and tight
1f6mti3qidq_24-8-rgb_front after the goal post we also have our crosses which we are going to jet out straight in front of us
1f6mti3qidq_25-8-rgb_front you can do a right one or a left one
1f6mti3qidq_26-8-rgb_front we want to cross it right in front of our body comfortably
1f6mti3qidq_27-8-rgb_front next we have k is
1f6mti3qidq_28-8-rgb_front now with k is you can either do a right or left
1f6mti3qidq_29-8-rgb_front we are basically going to keep our torso forward
1f6mti3qidq_3-8-rgb_front now we are going to learn the most basic motions that you are going to need to be the basis of every cheer
1f6mti3qidq_30-8-rgb_front we want to do a k motion
1f6mti3qidq_31-8-rgb_front you want to keep both of your arms in your peripheral vision
1f6mti3qidq_32-8-rgb_front you can do either a left k or a right k
1f6mti3qidq_33-8-rgb_front those are going to be some of the basic movements
1f6mti3qidq_34-8-rgb_front last but not least this is a great one to get the crowd going
1f6mti3qidq_35-8-rgb_front we are going to learn a punch
1f6mti3qidq_36-8-rgb_front it is really similar to the goal post that we talked about earlier
1f6mti3qidq_37-8-rgb_front you are going to want to keep this arm nice and flat as close to your ear as possible
1f6mti3qidq_38-8-rgb_front you can go straight into your punch or you can add a little oomph to it at the very end
1f6mti3qidq_39-8-rgb_front we can do those again with our right hand or our left hand
1f6mti3qidq_4-8-rgb_front first and foremost we want to start out with our high v
1f6mti3qidq_40-8-rgb_front so now that you have learned your basic motions we can go ahead and put them in to combinations which will then become your movements for a cheer
1f6mti3qidq_5-8-rgb_front we want to keep our hands in the fist
1f6mti3qidq_6-8-rgb_front we also want to make sure that our big dough nut holes are facing out
1f6mti3qidq_7-8-rgb_front so the most basic movement is going to be your high v
1f6mti3qidq_8-8-rgb_front after we have learned the high v we can move down to a low v which is going to be the same thing
1f6mti3qidq_9-8-rgb_front one thing that is important when we are learning our v is is to always make sure to keep your arms slightly in front of you to where you can see them out of the corner of your eyes
1faed0ulvsa_0-8-rgb_front hi i am jeremy blackwell i am here today to help you get started on your basement remodel project
1faed0ulvsa_1-8-rgb_front one thing to remember when plumbing your basement is that the location of the toilet is not as important as it first may seem
1faed0ulvsa_10-8-rgb_front a lot of people when they are finishing their basement are concerned with the resale value of their home
1faed0ulvsa_11-8-rgb_front and if this is a concern for you you want to make sure and have a shower and a bathtub in your basement bathroom
1faed0ulvsa_12-8-rgb_front the only problem is that you will not be able to fit a one piece tub and shower in some basements because of the way they have been built with the stairwell and you certainly can not fit it through a window
1faed0ulvsa_13-8-rgb_front so what we do in that case is set a cast iron tub or a material like cast iron and then just do a cultured marble or tile surround around the bathtub
1faed0ulvsa_2-8-rgb_front where that pipe is sticking out of the concrete is not where it has to be
1faed0ulvsa_3-8-rgb_front it is possible to move that that plumbing to to make a better space for your toilet
1faed0ulvsa_4-8-rgb_front there are certain restrictions though on where to set the toilet so you want to make sure and take that into account when you are framing
1faed0ulvsa_5-8-rgb_front you have got to have your toilet fifteen and a half to sixteen inches at least from any finished surface so that there is room to get in and out of this confined space
1faed0ulvsa_6-8-rgb_front the the toilet flange itself must be off of the wall about twelve inches or so too to to have the toilet fit into the correct place
1faed0ulvsa_7-8-rgb_front another common mistake that most homeowners make when finishing their own basement is they forget to put a fan in the bathroom
1faed0ulvsa_8-8-rgb_front the fan is very important because not only does it take the unsightly vapors out of the house but it also takes any condensation that develops and vents it outside of the house
1faed0ulvsa_9-8-rgb_front this is also very important do not forget the the fan in the bathroom

1fqy7nu35zy_1-5-rgb_front we are going to do some twist there is a lot of ankle work involving irish step dancing and a good exercise is to rotate your ankle like this
1fqy7nu35zy_2-5-rgb_front not necessarily to give you strong ankles but to give you loose and flexible ankles
1fqy7nu35zy_3-5-rgb_front a very popular move is to twist going forward like this where your doing stepping but your twisting when you land your foot
1fqy7nu35zy_4-5-rgb_front so you go twist twist twist twist twist and you can do the same combinations going backwards twist twist twist twist twist
1fqy7nu35zy_5-5-rgb_front so if your doing it faster it really involves a lot of ankle work
1fqy7nu35zy_6-5-rgb_front that is the twist
1fqy7nu35zy_7-5-rgb_front so watch again we do it slowly first twist twist twist twist twist your flicking your ankle and then back and if you do it faster
1fth1xckqnw_0-8-rgb_front once you have mastered doing bunny hops which is basically a short series of hops all in a row just to keep yourself balanced in one place
1fth1xckqnw_1-8-rgb_front you can actually expand that into something else where you do bunny hops and you do it in a circle
1fth1xckqnw_2-8-rgb_front basically you are twisting your body around it is similar to turning
1fth1xckqnw_3-8-rgb_front so what you are going to be wanting to do is you are wanting to lean your body in the direction that you want the unicycle to turn and then as soon as you hop up into the air you are basically torquing the unicycle around with you
1fth1xckqnw_4-8-rgb_front then you hit the ground and you do the same thing again you are leaning in the direction you want to turn and then you torque the unicycle in that direction to come with you
1fth1xckqnw_5-8-rgb_front so it looks a little bit like this
1fth1xckqnw_6-8-rgb_front you ride forward you are going to stall go ahead and do a couple of hops just to get your balance
1fth1xckqnw_7-8-rgb_front so i am going to jump up in the air and i am going to torque that direction so
1fth1xckqnw_8-8-rgb_front and that is how you do bunny hopping in a circle
1fzfm65z0zk_0-8-rgb_front as you can see this is a very different brush
1fzfm65z0zk_1-8-rgb_front this is called either a foundation or concealer brush and it is a smooth palette and the bristles are very close
1fzfm65z0zk_10-8-rgb_front as you can see i put quite a lot on the back of my hand
1fzfm65z0zk_11-8-rgb_front go ahead and put it underneath her eyes and like i said this goes ahead and gives you the appearance of not only taking away those imperfections underneath the eyes but it also pops out certain bone structures in your face because you do want to pop out those high cheek bones and this is exactly what this does when you use this
1fzfm65z0zk_12-8-rgb_front you want to pop out those cheek bones especially on stage because you want to give the appearance of having perfect bone structure right
1fzfm65z0zk_13-8-rgb_front so how do we do that
1fzfm65z0zk_14-8-rgb_front that is achieved through makeup
1fzfm65z0zk_15-8-rgb_front makeup does so many origins and as you can see i am putting it right here on the base of her nose
1fzfm65z0zk_16-8-rgb_front you want to go ahead and get it down
1fzfm65z0zk_17-8-rgb_front and it is almost like a square rectangular shape that i am doing this in
1fzfm65z0zk_18-8-rgb_front make sure that it is very very smoothed out and you do not want it clumpy and you want to make sure and as you can see i am not i am not doing it in a way that i would be painting i am actually pushing down on it with a brush
1fzfm65z0zk_19-8-rgb_front so you push down on it to get that nice perfect skin tone and as you can see i went all the way up into this space right here with that concealer and we are going to do that exact same thing on the other side of the face
1fzfm65z0zk_2-8-rgb_front so they are very very almost feels like they are wet feeling and this is concealer
1fzfm65z0zk_20-8-rgb_front right there on the nose like i said
1fzfm65z0zk_21-8-rgb_front and right up into the eye corners as you also want it there
1fzfm65z0zk_22-8-rgb_front and make sure that it is very nicely and evenly smoothed out
1fzfm65z0zk_23-8-rgb_front there we go
1fzfm65z0zk_3-8-rgb_front and as you can see the concealer is a little bit whiter than her natural skin tone and that is sometimes what you want to do
1fzfm65z0zk_4-8-rgb_front you do not want to go too light though or you do not want to go where it is too dark because concealer is used to bring out features in the face
1fzfm65z0zk_5-8-rgb_front and usually concealer is not used over the entire face
1fzfm65z0zk_6-8-rgb_front it is just used to cover up different things like under the eyes
1fzfm65z0zk_7-8-rgb_front this covers up as we call it those skunk eyes raccoon eyes is what i mean
1fzfm65z0zk_8-8-rgb_front raccoon eyes
1fzfm65z0zk_9-8-rgb_front and you go ahead and well actually sometimes i like to do is use my own hand as a palette because the heat of my hand will melt the concealer just a little bit better so it goes on just a little bit smoother
1fdmm1luasy_0-8-rgb_front hi i am evan from gregg is greenway cycles and today we are going to go over how to tighten or loosen your brakes on your bicycle
1fdmm1luasy_1-8-rgb_front the first thing that you want to do when tightening or loosening your breaks is decide where exactly it is comfortable for you to pull on the lever
1fdmm1luasy_10-8-rgb_front and then also a secondary method to adjust the tightness or looseness of your brakes is to come back to the actual caliper itself here on the back of the bike
1fdmm1luasy_11-8-rgb_front with a five millimeter allen key you can actually adjust the pull right at the brake caliper itself
1fdmm1luasy_12-8-rgb_front so you can just adjust how much cable is being pulled right at the caliper and it is kind of a hit and miss since you can not be pulling and adjust at the same time
1fdmm1luasy_13-8-rgb_front so you kind of have to make an adjustment then check you pull
1fdmm1luasy_14-8-rgb_front and that seems a little bit too tight so maybe you let just a little bit more out
1fdmm1luasy_15-8-rgb_front there
1fdmm1luasy_16-8-rgb_front then give it another pull and that feels good
1fdmm1luasy_17-8-rgb_front and then your last check is to make sure that your pads are not rubbing on either your disc rotor or on your wheel
1fdmm1luasy_18-8-rgb_front and in this case we have a disc rotor and so it sounds good
1fdmm1luasy_19-8-rgb_front there is no pad rubbing the wheel is not dragging at all
1fdmm1luasy_2-8-rgb_front if you like it to pull all the way back to the bar then you know that you need to loosen up your brakes a little bit
1fdmm1luasy_20_21_22-8-rgb_front the pull is good nice and comfortable not too far not too close and that is how you adjust your brakes
1fdmm1luasy_3-8-rgb_front and if you like just a little bit of pull before your breaks start to engage then you know you need to tighten them up
1fdmm1luasy_4-8-rgb_front one of the easiest adjustments you can make when tightening your brakes is with the barrel adjuster here
1fdmm1luasy_5-8-rgb_front and you just go ahead and spin it clockwise until you feel you are getting an adequate amount of pull
1fdmm1luasy_6-8-rgb_front whatever feels good for you
1fdmm1luasy_7-8-rgb_front and then that looks right about good about there pulling about half way before it starts to engage
1fdmm1luasy_8-8-rgb_front and then this nut here go ahead and lock that down so that this one is keeping this one stationary up against the lever body
1fdmm1luasy_9-8-rgb_front so that is one way to go ahead and do it
1fdwdkorgka_2-8-rgb_front one of the ways i teach my students to get good balance is an exercise for it you will want to make sure you are in the correct posture
1fdwdkorgka_3-8-rgb_front you will want to bring one foot up right up in front of you it should be straight out and this will add an extra obstacle to help to keep you where you have to maintain your balance
1fdwdkorgka_4-8-rgb_front if you practice this every day your balance will come to you try reversing it and then bring that foot down and bring the other foot up again bring it straight up and rotate at the foot and then reverse it
1fdwdkorgka_5-8-rgb_front you may find that when you first start this move you might be wobbly trying to get off the floor
1fdwdkorgka_6-8-rgb_front you can try lifting and just doing it this far until you feel comfortable enough that you are not going to fall and then you can lift it all the way up but to get good balance you really want to try to get that leg all the way up
1fdwdkorgka_7-8-rgb_front this is something that if you practice it daily in just a few minutes if you are on the phone or anything else it is a move that will eventually come to you and it will greatly help your balance
1fjobgfnwli_1-8-rgb_front right now i am going to be talking about patterns
1fjobgfnwli_10-8-rgb_front you can turn it around and there is a different pattern the flowers are different colors
1fjobgfnwli_11-8-rgb_front the patterns are very essential to what you are going to be wearing
1fjobgfnwli_12-8-rgb_front if you are going to be wearing a solid dress a pattern is going to be okay
1fjobgfnwli_13-8-rgb_front if you are going to be wearing a patterned outfit then a patterned purse is probably not your best choice
1fjobgfnwli_14-8-rgb_front i would definitely take the next step when you are looking at patterns
1fjobgfnwli_15-8-rgb_front when you are checking out your outfit make sure you know what kind of patterns you want to match with that outfit before you go out and buy that bag
1fjobgfnwli_16-8-rgb_front up next we are going to be talking about designers
1fjobgfnwli_2-8-rgb_front there are many different patterns in choosing a handbag
1fjobgfnwli_3-8-rgb_front you will see so many different patterns colors bright colors and bright patterns
1fjobgfnwli_4-8-rgb_front the most commonly known different patterns is vera bradley
1fjobgfnwli_5-8-rgb_front as you can see in this bag right here there is a different pattern all over the bag
1fjobgfnwli_6-8-rgb_front it is the same pattern but you can buy different patterns different colors
1fjobgfnwli_7-8-rgb_front there are different names
1fjobgfnwli_8-8-rgb_front there are different everything s
1fjobgfnwli_9-8-rgb_front also for another example here is another bag with a different patterns with flowers and flowers are very in
1furuv5lj4q_0-8-rgb_front o k
1furuv5lj4q_1-8-rgb_front now you have all your supplies ready and the first step we are going to do is exfoliate the skin
1furuv5lj4q_2-8-rgb_front the reason for this is to remove all dry and dead skin cells
1furuv5lj4q_3-8-rgb_front you want to use your buffing cream
1furuv5lj4q_4-8-rgb_front you are going to do this in the shower
1furuv5lj4q_5-8-rgb_front and you want to scrub the buffer onto your skin and yeah that is plenty and go ahead and do that on your legs
1g8ywlfws8i_0-8-rgb_front so the first step in trimming any piece is to make sure that it is centered
1g8ywlfws8i_1-8-rgb_front and the way that you do that is start the wheel head spinning and you are going to see that it is a little off center right now
1g8ywlfws8i_10-8-rgb_front it does not need to be changed in shape very much
1g8ywlfws8i_11-8-rgb_front but on the inner piece you can see there is a little corner a little ledge and i do not want that to be there
1g8ywlfws8i_12-8-rgb_front so i am going to remove that with my ribbon tool as well
1g8ywlfws8i_13-8-rgb_front so once that is smooth the next thing you do is you smooth the bottom of the piece out with your sponge
1g8ywlfws8i_14-8-rgb_front this is going to be the last time you are going to touch the bottom of it before you fire it so make sure it is to your satisfaction
1g8ywlfws8i_15-8-rgb_front and now is the time when you would either sign in your name or push in your impression with a stamp that you have either made yourself and fired or a rubber stamp that you have had made at a rubber stamp company
1g8ywlfws8i_16-8-rgb_front push that in there and we are ready to do the trimming on the bowl
1g8ywlfws8i_2-8-rgb_front so it is a process that takes a little while to learn
1g8ywlfws8i_3-8-rgb_front it is called tapping on the center
1g8ywlfws8i_4-8-rgb_front but you really just pat the pot give it a little spank
1g8ywlfws8i_5-8-rgb_front it is kind of counter intuitive because you are hitting at first you are going to want to hit at the wrong place and you are going to make it more off center
1g8ywlfws8i_6-8-rgb_front give yourself some patience with that
1g8ywlfws8i_7-8-rgb_front once you have got it on center you are going to take your ribbon tool
1g8ywlfws8i_8-8-rgb_front this is called a ribbon tool because when you go to trimming it makes a ribbon of clay that peels right off of the piece
1g8ywlfws8i_9-8-rgb_front so i just want on the outside part to make it smooth
1g93sgtzvii_0-8-rgb_front this is mark bowers from bowersphotography com in utah and this segment is flash photography lighting gels
1g93sgtzvii_1-8-rgb_front what i would like to show you is there is a lot of gels that are available out there
1g93sgtzvii_10-8-rgb_front i put duct tape on the back and i wrapped it the same diameter as the gel and i just put it right over the flash tube and at low power this just puts out the most beautiful brown color that you imagine
1g93sgtzvii_11-8-rgb_front another thing i want to show you is how the lights look on a background
1g93sgtzvii_12-8-rgb_front i have got a little spotlight here and this can show you kind of this is a red gel and we will just put it on the background
1g93sgtzvii_13-8-rgb_front now this particular spot is a hot light
1g93sgtzvii_14-8-rgb_front it will melt the gels and so you have to have some space between the gels and the backgrounds
1g93sgtzvii_15-8-rgb_front that is a red one here is a blue one and you match the backgrounds with the color that you want to show
1g93sgtzvii_2-8-rgb_front usually you can find these in theatrical supply stores and some nice photography stores
1g93sgtzvii_3-8-rgb_front there is hundreds of different colors that you can get
1g93sgtzvii_4-8-rgb_front some of my favorites i bought in sheets
1g93sgtzvii_5-8-rgb_front you can get them in some of my favorites are blues and greens and purples and reds
1g93sgtzvii_6-8-rgb_front there are some things that you do not have to spend a whole lot of money on
1g93sgtzvii_7-8-rgb_front what i have done mostly with my gels is because i shoot with a flash that is very low power it is two hundred watts or less so that i can actually put the gel against the flash and it is not going to melt
1g93sgtzvii_8-8-rgb_front one of my favorite ones is this kodak film that i just rescued from the garbage can not very expensive
1g93sgtzvii_9-8-rgb_front in fact it was free
1g9c_yqzh5e_0-8-rgb_front so i am continuing ripping my paper and one you know this is why i like tearing my paper down
1g9c_yqzh5e_1-8-rgb_front you can almost see how this is sort of like you know as i am working the coolest thing to me about being an artist you know working is that you get ideas
1g9c_yqzh5e_10-8-rgb_front so i am going to save these two and i am going to cut these down
1g9c_yqzh5e_11-8-rgb_front you know some days i like big prints
1g9c_yqzh5e_12-8-rgb_front some days i like small prints
1g9c_yqzh5e_13-8-rgb_front but what i am going to start coating are just a couple of small sheets to show just how to coat and how to work with the material
1g9c_yqzh5e_14-8-rgb_front one interesting thing about what is going on here today is it is a very humid day here in austin texas and this paper is already it is sucking up the humidity
1g9c_yqzh5e_15-8-rgb_front i can almost feel it curl right now
1g9c_yqzh5e_16-8-rgb_front that is one thing about print making to me
1g9c_yqzh5e_17-8-rgb_front it is just so hands on that you really start to notice things
1g9c_yqzh5e_2-8-rgb_front you know i am looking at the way i am tearing this paper down and it is like a book already and i am like what kind of book can i make today with cyanotypes and one thing that i forgot to mention is that the cyanotype is cheap
1g9c_yqzh5e_3-8-rgb_front i mean one of the few materials that i work with that is dirt cheap
1g9c_yqzh5e_4-8-rgb_front paper is not that cheap when you use a lot of it but the material itself is
1g9c_yqzh5e_5-8-rgb_front so again i am back to kind of daydreaming about my little book here
1g9c_yqzh5e_6-8-rgb_front i am going to keep ripping
1g9c_yqzh5e_7-8-rgb_front so again i have got another quarter sheet and this is where this is kind of cool too because i can think about what size prints i want to make
1g9c_yqzh5e_8-8-rgb_front i am not buying this paper
1g9c_yqzh5e_9-8-rgb_front you know thinking in my little crazy head here like oh i can make a print that is this long or i can make a print that is this big
1gdezsepi_o_10-8-rgb_front we are going to go ahead and shake that up
1gdezsepi_o_11-8-rgb_front just like so
1gdezsepi_o_12-8-rgb_front pour that with our ice into a highball glass
1gdezsepi_o_13-8-rgb_front yum yum add in a stirry straw and we are going to garnish this with a cherry and a wedge of lime
1gdezsepi_o_14-8-rgb_front and a little known fact this drink was created by fred faulkenburg of canada who won the nineteen iba international cocktail competition with this very ramcooler
1gdezsepi_o_15-8-rgb_front enjoy
1gdezsepi_o_16-8-rgb_front cheers
1gdezsepi_o_6-8-rgb_front then we are going to add in a half ounce of gallianno which is a fabulous french liqueur
1gdezsepi_o_7-8-rgb_front and we are going to add in two ounces of lime juice which is about four good squeezes
1gdezsepi_o_8-8-rgb_front so this is going to be a very lime flavored drink
1gdezsepi_o_9-8-rgb_front alright
1goqlpdtr3c_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is chell and i am a modern dancer in austin texas
1goqlpdtr3c_1-8-rgb_front i am going to show you how to do downward dog which is a yoga position
1goqlpdtr3c_10-8-rgb_front there is a lot of things to think about here
1goqlpdtr3c_11-8-rgb_front and everybody is going to be in a different place with it
1goqlpdtr3c_12-8-rgb_front you might feel you can not bring your heels to the ground that is fine
1goqlpdtr3c_13-8-rgb_front you might find you are not ready to straighten your legs bend your knees a little bit that is fine
1goqlpdtr3c_14-8-rgb_front really push through all of the fingers through your hands and the palms of your hands
1goqlpdtr3c_15-8-rgb_front it is really important whatever position you are in here that you are pushing through your shoulder blades pushing them into the ground dropping your shoulders pushing your arms reaching with your hips
1goqlpdtr3c_16-8-rgb_front take deep breaths while you are there so that you are relaxing and releasing and deepening the stretch
1goqlpdtr3c_17-8-rgb_front you will feel a nice intense stretch all the way into your calves in that position
1goqlpdtr3c_18-8-rgb_front so that is a great way to do downward dog when you are in modern dance
1goqlpdtr3c_2-8-rgb_front however i do it the way i learned it in modern dance which is a little bit different
1goqlpdtr3c_3-8-rgb_front so basically i am going to come to all fours as if i was in a dog position
1goqlpdtr3c_4-8-rgb_front but then i am going to push my knees off of the ground and i am going to push my hips up towards the ceiling
1goqlpdtr3c_5-8-rgb_front as much as possible i want to have a tight little angle there a flat back and straight legs
1goqlpdtr3c_6-8-rgb_front and i want to push my ankles towards the ground my heels towards the ground
1goqlpdtr3c_7-8-rgb_front so i am going to put my hands down on the ground tuck my toes under and push my hips towards the ceiling
1goqlpdtr3c_8-8-rgb_front while i am in this position i am going to drop my shoulders i do not want my shoulders up by my ears i want to drop them into my back drop my shoulder blades into my back
1goqlpdtr3c_9-8-rgb_front push through my hands push through my feet drop my heels towards the ground straighten my knees
1gs4hb9gpoi_0-8-rgb_front okay another way you can fix an error is kind of goes back to not making it in the first place
1gs4hb9gpoi_1-8-rgb_front and one of the ways that i find that i make less and less errors is i am more comfortable where i am at in my studio
1gs4hb9gpoi_10-8-rgb_front so that is one of my secrets and i hope it works for ya
1gs4hb9gpoi_2-8-rgb_front and i have a nice where i work
1gs4hb9gpoi_3-8-rgb_front i have music that i listen to and things like that
1gs4hb9gpoi_4-8-rgb_front what happens is there is less stress
1gs4hb9gpoi_5-8-rgb_front and if if you are in a peaceful place and it is less stress and you are doing what you love to do you are probably not going to make as many mistakes
1gs4hb9gpoi_6-8-rgb_front so if you are prone to painting at the kitchen table while you are cooking dinner and the kids are running in and out of the house and the husband is not home yet might not you might make some errors and you might not be able to fix them
1gs4hb9gpoi_7-8-rgb_front but if you can find a nice secluded place where you can actually paint and be by yourself and be comfortable where you are at you will not make as many errors because you are going to be more relaxed
1gs4hb9gpoi_8-8-rgb_front and if you do make an error it will be much easier to fix and you just will not be all stressed out
1gs4hb9gpoi_9-8-rgb_front so definitely be happy where you paint and you will make a lot fewer mistakes
1gtkfzirzyk_0-8-rgb_front hi
1gtkfzirzyk_10-8-rgb_front finally we have the single pennant bracelet that actually would work well with a necklace
1gtkfzirzyk_11-8-rgb_front you can find one that matches it switch it up a little bit play around with it but always stick to silver with the earrings and necklace if that is what the color of your bracelet is
1gtkfzirzyk_12-8-rgb_front also if you are wearing a bracelet it is a good idea to make sure that one piece of jewelry is your stand out piece
1gtkfzirzyk_13-8-rgb_front everything else needs to be a little bit more subtle so that the eye does not have conflicting interest
1gtkfzirzyk_14-8-rgb_front finally this last watch that we have is actually made for a man
1gtkfzirzyk_15-8-rgb_front men can wear bracelets as well as women
1gtkfzirzyk_16-8-rgb_front this one kind of resembles a watch band without the watch face on it and can be worn in a variety of ways with a variety of outfits
1gtkfzirzyk_17-8-rgb_front join us in the next segment and we are going to talk about anklets
1gtkfzirzyk_2-8-rgb_front we are going to talk a little bit about how to accessorize using your bracelets
1gtkfzirzyk_3-8-rgb_front the first few examples that we have are this one here
1gtkfzirzyk_4-8-rgb_front this one is a little bit fancier and typically you would think about pairing it up with something something more glamorous that you would be going out for an evening out on the town
1gtkfzirzyk_5-8-rgb_front i on the other hand like the mix things up a little bit pairing up fancy stylish things with a casual outfit
1gtkfzirzyk_6-8-rgb_front so for me this would be something that i might want to have some fun with
1gtkfzirzyk_7-8-rgb_front second bracelet option that we have is this one here
1gtkfzirzyk_8-8-rgb_front this is an example of a charm bracelet
1gtkfzirzyk_9-8-rgb_front and one that i can see going well with a sparkly ring
1gwf0ijuvyg_0-8-rgb_front hi in this segment we are going to do another type of a foot brush
1gwf0ijuvyg_1-8-rgb_front we call this one the tommy kick or the tommy brush because he is basically the guy who does it the best and it kind of got named after him
1gwf0ijuvyg_10-8-rgb_front you can go into a lot of different moves after that tommy kick
1gwf0ijuvyg_11-8-rgb_front it is a great way to save a frisbee or to pass a frisbee or to get the frisbee into another different part of your combination
1gwf0ijuvyg_12-8-rgb_front so we will try that one one more time you go to clock spin
1gwf0ijuvyg_13-8-rgb_front you will set it up swing your foot across
1gwf0ijuvyg_14-8-rgb_front the tommy kick
1gwf0ijuvyg_2-8-rgb_front and what we are going to do it is this one for me a clockwise spin
1gwf0ijuvyg_3-8-rgb_front so clockwise spin here and then i am going to look at the bottom of the frisbee again
1gwf0ijuvyg_4-8-rgb_front i am going to bring my foot up and i am going to hit it with the outside of my foot bringing it back here
1gwf0ijuvyg_5-8-rgb_front swinging it across the frisbee so it comes back up this way
1gwf0ijuvyg_6-8-rgb_front so clock spin here here
1gwf0ijuvyg_7-8-rgb_front try that again
1gwf0ijuvyg_8-8-rgb_front clock spin set it up here
1gwf0ijuvyg_9-8-rgb_front clock spin set it up here
1gxwdkek85y_0-8-rgb_front so like what i told you in the previous clip the first thing that we need to do is go ahead and take this seam out
1gxwdkek85y_1-8-rgb_front and most pants have a tack here
1gxwdkek85y_10-8-rgb_front there we go
1gxwdkek85y_11-8-rgb_front the seam in the middle right here
1gxwdkek85y_12-8-rgb_front they are never going to be over here
1gxwdkek85y_13-8-rgb_front they are always in the same spot
1gxwdkek85y_14-8-rgb_front let is just go ahead and cut this one too
1gxwdkek85y_15-8-rgb_front be real careful if you are using a razor blade
1gxwdkek85y_16-8-rgb_front you do not want to cut your pants
1gxwdkek85y_17_18-8-rgb_front these types of clothing they will fray pretty easily we will have that one open now that we have that done we are going to be taking out this
1gxwdkek85y_19-8-rgb_front that keeps the hem up
1gxwdkek85y_2-8-rgb_front sometimes it is sewn
1gxwdkek85y_20-8-rgb_front and that is a blind stich and usually they are right here in the corner where the seams are
1gxwdkek85y_21-8-rgb_front you just have to look for a small piece of thread hanging out
1gxwdkek85y_22-8-rgb_front see there is a leap right there
1gxwdkek85y_23-8-rgb_front i am pretty sure that is right where the blind stich starts
1gxwdkek85y_24-8-rgb_front yeah that is it
1gxwdkek85y_25-8-rgb_front you just pop that out and it just pulls right out
1gxwdkek85y_26-8-rgb_front and this is the reason that a lot of men is pants the hems will come undone because if you pull one thread like that and i am sure this has happen to you before the hem is out
1gxwdkek85y_27-8-rgb_front and now we have to go do the other one
1gxwdkek85y_28-8-rgb_front let me open this up
1gxwdkek85y_29-8-rgb_front you just kind of look around
1gxwdkek85y_3-8-rgb_front sometimes it is done with a needle like a little tack
1gxwdkek85y_30-8-rgb_front and there it is
1gxwdkek85y_31-8-rgb_front you can kind of see it because it the seam overlaps itself
1gxwdkek85y_32-8-rgb_front i think that is it
1gxwdkek85y_33-8-rgb_front that might not be it
1gxwdkek85y_34-8-rgb_front okay
1gxwdkek85y_35-8-rgb_front maybe it takes you just a minute but that is okay
1gxwdkek85y_36-8-rgb_front oh i think it is the wrong side
1gxwdkek85y_37-8-rgb_front let me look on the other side
1gxwdkek85y_38-8-rgb_front even me it takes me several times
1gxwdkek85y_39-8-rgb_front i think there it is right there
1gxwdkek85y_4-8-rgb_front but i like to use a razor blade to take things a part
1gxwdkek85y_40-8-rgb_front see usually the is when the piece of thread is hanging out
1gxwdkek85y_41-8-rgb_front pull that
1gxwdkek85y_42-8-rgb_front there we go
1gxwdkek85y_43-8-rgb_front let me just yank this thing out
1gxwdkek85y_44-8-rgb_front okay
1gxwdkek85y_45-8-rgb_front so now that we have the hem undone we are going to lay it out and in the next clip we are going to talk about the measurements and why we are going to mark it the way that we are going to mark it
1gxwdkek85y_46-8-rgb_front so let is do that in the next clip
1gxwdkek85y_5-8-rgb_front you can use a seamer ripper if you want
1gxwdkek85y_6-8-rgb_front you just make a little tiny cut
1gxwdkek85y_7-8-rgb_front bring that down
1gxwdkek85y_8-8-rgb_front you do it to all sides
1gxwdkek85y_9-8-rgb_front and these are always done right at the seam
1ghvkzsmgbm_0-8-rgb_front today we are going to make this beautiful vegetable flower centerpiece in crudites
1ghvkzsmgbm_1-8-rgb_front not only is it a fabulous centerpiece for your table it is a unique way to serve your vegetable crudites
1ghvkzsmgbm_10-8-rgb_front so you will want to cut off the ends
1ghvkzsmgbm_11-8-rgb_front and then you want to cut a slice
1ghvkzsmgbm_12-8-rgb_front about a quarter inch slice like that
1ghvkzsmgbm_13-8-rgb_front into little rounds
1ghvkzsmgbm_14-8-rgb_front you want quite a few of these because you need two for each flower
1ghvkzsmgbm_15-8-rgb_front and it depends on how many flowers you want to make
1ghvkzsmgbm_16-8-rgb_front if you want a nice full basket of flowers you are going to make a lot of flowers
1ghvkzsmgbm_17-8-rgb_front and then you just set those aside
1ghvkzsmgbm_18-8-rgb_front and then i will show you how to slice the root vegetables for the flower petals
1ghvkzsmgbm_2-8-rgb_front the basket is stuffed full of fresh vegetable sticks ready for dipping
1ghvkzsmgbm_3-8-rgb_front and the flowers are made of an assortment of root vegetables
1ghvkzsmgbm_4-8-rgb_front all edible
1ghvkzsmgbm_5-8-rgb_front including sweet potatoes turnip radish and kohlrabi
1ghvkzsmgbm_6-8-rgb_front we will start by preparing some carrot rounds
1ghvkzsmgbm_7-8-rgb_front you want to peel some carrots up
1ghvkzsmgbm_8-8-rgb_front you want to use some skinny ones and some fat ones
1ghvkzsmgbm_9-8-rgb_front so we will peel those and then we are going to cut a whole bunch of little rounds that we will use for making our flowers
1gjp23wv368_0-8-rgb_front so after you have both your synch and asynch four club fountains together you might want to think about switching in between them without stopping
1gjp23wv368_1-8-rgb_front now this is a pretty cool visual effect but it will take a lot of time and a lot of practice
1gjp23wv368_2-8-rgb_front so if you start with your asynch pattern what you are going to do is you are going to take your strong hand and you are going to throw a triple throw and leave all other throws exactly the same
1gjp23wv368_3-8-rgb_front so what this will do is it will delay your right hand by one beat thereby putting it into the same pattern as your left and moving you into synchrous
1gjp23wv368_4-8-rgb_front it looks something like this
1gjp23wv368_5-8-rgb_front here we are in asynch we will make a triple throw out of our left hand and keep all other throws the same and it puts you into synch
1gjp23wv368_6-8-rgb_front now to get out of synch to go back to asynch you are going to do the exact same thing you are going to delay your hand by one beat but this will put you into asynch just like that
1gjp23wv368_7-8-rgb_front hopefully you do not drop like i just did
1gjp23wv368_8-8-rgb_front but again so you can see how that works we will be in synch a triple throw puts us right back into asynch
1gjp23wv368_9-8-rgb_front now that triple throw can be pretty hard to execute it sometimes but you just have to really think about isolating your right and left hands getting a triple and a double and it should all work out
1glvsfq3zg8_0-8-rgb_front the first thing we need to look at is actually getting the glass melted before we start making beads
1glvsfq3zg8_1-8-rgb_front you need to be very careful when you melt glass because if you heat glass up too quickly it is just like dropping an ice cube into a hot glass of tea it will shatter very quickly it is called
1glvsfq3zg8_2-8-rgb_front so with a piece of glass with a diameter this large you want to make sure that you introduce it into the flame very very slowly and you start at the back end of the flame about six inches out from the head of the torch
1glvsfq3zg8_3-8-rgb_front so remember the thicker the diameter of your glass the more slowly you are going to have to introduce it to the flame
1glvsfq3zg8_4-8-rgb_front as this glass starts to heat up and gets to the point that it is malleable enough to work it will start to get an orange glow to the tip
1glvsfq3zg8_5-8-rgb_front as the orange increases going down the tube you can then bring the glass closer and closer to the head of the torch
1glvsfq3zg8_6-8-rgb_front you never want to work closer than about two inches to the head of the torch
1glvsfq3zg8_7-8-rgb_front so now you can begin to see the tip is orange you introduce more of the glass and as you want to make sure that as you are heating the glass you keep rotating the rod in your hand
1glvsfq3zg8_8-8-rgb_front as you continue to heat the orange color will spread and eventually the glass is going to become the consistency of warm honey and it is going to start to droop when you hold the rod still
1glvsfq3zg8_9-8-rgb_front when you have this droop it is finally time to work your glass
1gqvlt2z-dy_0-8-rgb_front another way that things happens is as the child ages they obviously start to fall a lot
1gqvlt2z-dy_1-8-rgb_front as they learn to walk as they crawl and things of that nature
1gqvlt2z-dy_10-8-rgb_front we have got gymnastics
1gqvlt2z-dy_11-8-rgb_front we have got ballet
1gqvlt2z-dy_12-8-rgb_front we have got dance
1gqvlt2z-dy_13-8-rgb_front all this going on when bodies are not quite ready yet to handle the physical load that is being placed upon them
1gqvlt2z-dy_14-8-rgb_front it is these little bumps these little bruises these little chronic repetitive type motions that can actually create problems within the spine
1gqvlt2z-dy_15-8-rgb_front now you ask why does a child need to be checked
1gqvlt2z-dy_16-8-rgb_front one thing that i have told parents through out my chiropractic career is that as the twig is bent so grows the tree
1gqvlt2z-dy_17-8-rgb_front if a child has a at an early age there is a good possibility that that misalignment can grow into bigger things as that child ages
1gqvlt2z-dy_18-8-rgb_front it is much more effective to get that child taken of when they are young as opposed to waiting for it to be a problem
1gqvlt2z-dy_19-8-rgb_front so i would encourage you all to get your children checked by a chiropractor today
1gqvlt2z-dy_2-8-rgb_front they are falling and bumping into things and doing all things that kids do
1gqvlt2z-dy_3-8-rgb_front in fact some one study i think a survey showed that the average child falls about twenty five hundred times before they are five years old
1gqvlt2z-dy_4-8-rgb_front now i know i am way above average cause i know i fell way more than twenty five hundred times before i was five years old
1gqvlt2z-dy_5-8-rgb_front now another thing that happens as we age is that we go into youth sports
1gqvlt2z-dy_6-8-rgb_front not only youth sports but all kinds of other activities
1gqvlt2z-dy_7-8-rgb_front we have got soccer
1gqvlt2z-dy_8-8-rgb_front we have got football
1gqvlt2z-dy_9-8-rgb_front we have got baseball
1gycdy2pcyc_0-11-rgb_front hey we are talking about how to speeches and i am really excited because you have picked your topic now
1gycdy2pcyc_1-11-rgb_front you know what it is you want to teach us how to do
1gycdy2pcyc_10-11-rgb_front so as you are writing remember you are going to follow a one two three four order
1gycdy2pcyc_11-11-rgb_front now we are still going to have an introduction we are still going to have a conclusion but as far as three solid body parts like what you would have in a persuasive or an informative speech that is not what we are doing this time
1gycdy2pcyc_12-11-rgb_front now follow steps
1gycdy2pcyc_13-11-rgb_front first you do this second you do this third you do that
1gycdy2pcyc_14-11-rgb_front that is why our baby speech does not work out very well because there is really no method to the madness
1gycdy2pcyc_15-11-rgb_front you do what you do when you do it
1gycdy2pcyc_16-11-rgb_front this so i can learn it needs to follow an order
1gycdy2pcyc_17-11-rgb_front so now let is take a look at introductions and conclusions for the how to speech
1gycdy2pcyc_2-11-rgb_front now do not forget how to topic has to be culled down to a small manageable size and it has to be demonstrable and what i mean by that is your how to speech must follow chronological order or steps
1gycdy2pcyc_3-11-rgb_front you see in an informative speech you can just tell me the information but in a how to speech you have to follow an order
1gycdy2pcyc_4-11-rgb_front let is say we are going to learn how to back a cake
1gycdy2pcyc_5-11-rgb_front is the first thing you are going to tell me to put the cake in the oven
1gycdy2pcyc_6-11-rgb_front no
1gycdy2pcyc_7-11-rgb_front what is the first thing you are going to tell me
1gycdy2pcyc_8-11-rgb_front to go and get the ingredients or go to the store and buy the cake mix or whatever it is
1gycdy2pcyc_9-11-rgb_front the first step
1gzlygpq9zs_0-8-rgb_front chris murphy hi
1gzlygpq9zs_12-8-rgb_front so you want to keep your city contacts alive
1gzlygpq9zs_13-8-rgb_front so work the road for money and the city for contacts
1gzlygpq9zs_14-8-rgb_front so in the beginning the road work on the weekends you will get paid more money anyway so you want to do the road
1gzlygpq9zs_15-8-rgb_front you want to build your act in the city then go out in the road
1gzlygpq9zs_16-8-rgb_front however do not abandon the city
1gzlygpq9zs_17-8-rgb_front because what happens is many television acts come out of the city cause many showcases in front of agents who come out to the city
1gzlygpq9zs_18-8-rgb_front so you want to have both worlds okay do em both
1gzlygpq9zs_2-8-rgb_front i am here at the new york comedy club in new york city
1gzlygpq9zs_3-8-rgb_front today we are going to talk about how to have a career in comedy
1gzlygpq9zs_4-8-rgb_front okay
1gzlygpq9zs_5-8-rgb_front this is the road versus the city
1gzlygpq9zs_6-8-rgb_front there are two kinds of i should say when they first start out there is a road act and a city act
1gzlygpq9zs_7-8-rgb_front in the beginning what you want to do is be a city act in the beginning i will tell you why
1gzlygpq9zs_8-8-rgb_front many first of all city acts will always work the road never vice versa
1gzlygpq9zs_9_10_11-8-rgb_front why cause city acts is a little clique and they whisper in the owner is ear oh this guy is a hack it is not necessarily true but they want to keep their own position
1h0-yi_swbw_0-8-rgb_front hi i am robert nizza with the bti group in san francisco
1h0-yi_swbw_1-8-rgb_front i would like to speak with you about how to sell part of your business
1h0-yi_swbw_10-8-rgb_front second step is to do some accounting and figure out how much money that product or service generates what expenses are associated with it and have that separated out so that a buyer can accurately see what those numbers are so that a value can be developed from that and those are some first steps to thinking about how to sell part of your business
1h0-yi_swbw_2-8-rgb_front before you start thinking about selling part ask yourself what are my goals my objectives for wanting to sell part of the business
1h0-yi_swbw_3-8-rgb_front what will i be getting for that
1h0-yi_swbw_4-8-rgb_front most small businesses are sold as a complete asset sale
1h0-yi_swbw_5-8-rgb_front we do not usually sell just part of the business but let is say you did
1h0-yi_swbw_6-8-rgb_front one of the things that the buyer would want to see is what is the value of this part of your business
1h0-yi_swbw_7-8-rgb_front so if you do have a separate division of your business or a product line that you do want to sell it is really crucial to represent that accurately in terms of how much revenue does that product generate and what the expenses are associated with that product or different division of the company so that you can fully represent what exactly you are trying to sell
1h0-yi_swbw_8-8-rgb_front basically you want the buyer to be able to have a transparent view of what they are buying so before you want to sell part of your business or a product line or something like that
1h0-yi_swbw_9-8-rgb_front the first step is to understand why you want to sell it
1h1ykiscv_a_1-8-rgb_front now i have several hands laid out here like we are playing card poker so just kind of look at me in increments of we are going to start over here this is a pair of deuces with a ten kicker and this is the pair plus this is pertaining to the pair plus
1h1ykiscv_a_2-8-rgb_front let is say you have a dollar on the pair plus and you have a pair in your hand your going to get paid even money so your going to make a dollar
1h1ykiscv_a_3-8-rgb_front so they are going to pay you a dollar and this is just for the pair we are going to the next one which is a flush and on the flush your going to get paid for to so if you have a dollar you get paid
1h1ykiscv_a_4-8-rgb_front moving on to the next one this is a straight in this section you got a straight your going to get paid to on that so if you put a dollar up your going to get paid on your dollar
1h1ykiscv_a_5-8-rgb_front this is three of a kind we have three aces here three any of the same card you know this is where you start making some good money here if you put a dollar up your going to get paid to on that
1h1ykiscv_a_6-8-rgb_front so you make bucks on that dollar
1h1ykiscv_a_7-8-rgb_front this is where you really get this is a straight flush three cards same suit in a row that is to so if you got paid a dollar you got bucks if you get a little fistey start putting a little bit more money you can make some serious money if you get a straight flush but it is very rare occurrence that your going to get a straight flush or even a straight
1h1ykiscv_a_8-8-rgb_front that is why they pay to so these are all the pair plus hands
1h1ykiscv_a_9-8-rgb_front thank you for watching
1h3mvqdznbw_1-8-rgb_front so now i am going to show you how to do a double mat
1h3mvqdznbw_10-8-rgb_front so i write on here one quarter inch
1h3mvqdznbw_11-8-rgb_front now i am going to back this up one quarter inch
1h3mvqdznbw_12-8-rgb_front so it makes it real simple the only number i need to know is three and seven eighths
1h3mvqdznbw_13-8-rgb_front so i have backed it up a quarter inch for the inside mat and i have laid this out
1h3mvqdznbw_14-8-rgb_front again i know that my side margins are going to be a little bit different so i put my finger on twenty which is the size of the frame
1h3mvqdznbw_15-8-rgb_front and it is actually nine and a quarter
1h3mvqdznbw_16-8-rgb_front so half of that is four and five eighths
1h3mvqdznbw_17-8-rgb_front so we put my mat guide on four and five eighths we back it up for that quarter inch on the inside and now we lay this out
1h3mvqdznbw_18-8-rgb_front okay so i have put my mat into the mat cutter
1h3mvqdznbw_19-8-rgb_front this particular mat cutter cuts on a forty five
1h3mvqdznbw_2-8-rgb_front so again this particular one we did it larger
1h3mvqdznbw_20-8-rgb_front i have put the mat in about an eighth of an inch past the line
1h3mvqdznbw_21-8-rgb_front i come down about an eighth of an inch past the line
1h3mvqdznbw_22-8-rgb_front i move my bottom board here every single time so that when this blade goes through and makes a cut it does not go and make a cut through the same line which would make my cut on the mat not be nice and straight
1h3mvqdznbw_23-8-rgb_front okay now sometimes the mat does not just fall out like it did the last time
1h3mvqdznbw_24-8-rgb_front so what we do is we take a little razor blade and we pick this up because we do not want it to rip and then it will not make a beautiful corner
1h3mvqdznbw_25-8-rgb_front that is all it took was one little tiny nip
1h3mvqdznbw_3-8-rgb_front we are going to do a sixteen by twenty
1h3mvqdznbw_4-8-rgb_front so what we are going to do is take the top mat the one that you see the most of and we are going to cut that first
1h3mvqdznbw_5-8-rgb_front so we take our tape measure and we are going to measure to find out what our margins are going to be
1h3mvqdznbw_6-8-rgb_front so this frame is a sixteen by twenty so we see that it is seven and three quarters
1h3mvqdznbw_7-8-rgb_front so half of that is three and seven eighths
1h3mvqdznbw_8-8-rgb_front but remember that we have another mat to put underneath it and this is the top mat
1h3mvqdznbw_9-8-rgb_front so what we do is first we put it on three and seven eighths and we decide that i am going to use a quarter of an inch of the inside color
1hb73-7gufw_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is keith fitzpatrick
1hb73-7gufw_1-5-rgb_front this is hip hop moves for kids and we are going to go over something called the clown
1hb73-7gufw_10-5-rgb_front and as you do that your body goes up and down
1hb73-7gufw_11-5-rgb_front and up and down
1hb73-7gufw_12-5-rgb_front so when you do it together it is going one two three four
1hb73-7gufw_13-5-rgb_front and you just kind of jump into that
1hb73-7gufw_14-5-rgb_front boom boom
1hb73-7gufw_15-5-rgb_front you bounce
1hb73-7gufw_16-5-rgb_front one and two and
1hb73-7gufw_17-5-rgb_front okay so that is that part
1hb73-7gufw_18-5-rgb_front boom and boom and
1hb73-7gufw_19-5-rgb_front the next part your arms wave here and wave back this way
1hb73-7gufw_2-5-rgb_front now the clown is one of the dances that started all of the crumbing that everyone is doing all of a sudden now
1hb73-7gufw_20-5-rgb_front when you put it together you go
1hb73-7gufw_21-5-rgb_front one and here and a wave and a wave
1hb73-7gufw_22-5-rgb_front okay so again that is here here wave and wave
1hb73-7gufw_23-5-rgb_front then you just do it the other way
1hb73-7gufw_24-5-rgb_front here here wave and wave
1hb73-7gufw_25-5-rgb_front okay so when you put it together break it down
1hb73-7gufw_26-5-rgb_front here here boom boom boom
1hb73-7gufw_27-5-rgb_front here here boom boom boom
1hb73-7gufw_28-5-rgb_front and that is the clown
1hb73-7gufw_3-5-rgb_front but the clown is kind of different
1hb73-7gufw_4-5-rgb_front so when you do it
1hb73-7gufw_5-5-rgb_front you kind of start you on the real kind of silly and move around
1hb73-7gufw_6-5-rgb_front move around a lot like clowns
1hb73-7gufw_7-5-rgb_front clowns are really kind of crazy
1hb73-7gufw_8-5-rgb_front so you start here and your hands are this way
1hb73-7gufw_9-5-rgb_front you do this with your hands
1hiolzfqjdy_0-11-rgb_front hi
1hiolzfqjdy_2-11-rgb_front so the ingredients that we are going to be using for the german chocolate cake are a half cup of water bar of sweet of cooking chocolate cup of butter or margarine cups of sugar eggs teaspoon of vanilla cups of cake flour teaspoon of baking soda teaspoon of salt cup of buttermilk
1hiolzfqjdy_3-11-rgb_front you do not have to use cake flour if you do not have it or if you do not know what it is
1hiolzfqjdy_4-11-rgb_front you can use all purpose flour
1hiolzfqjdy_5-11-rgb_front the difference between the two is just that cake flour is more fine so if you just sift all purpose flour a couple of times it will work the same
1hiolzfqjdy_6-11-rgb_front if you do not have a sifter you can just use a wire whisk and it will do the same thing
1hmyxtfhrzw_0-3-rgb_front hi my name is dave andrews
1hmyxtfhrzw_1-3-rgb_front today i am going to give you some tips for creating a website
1hmyxtfhrzw_10-3-rgb_front i have a little bit of a rollover here on my navigation items but it is pretty obvious what each one of these do
1hmyxtfhrzw_11-3-rgb_front i click right here on press for example that brings you to some press releases for some programs i have on my website
1hmyxtfhrzw_12-3-rgb_front now the second thing or the third thing you want to look at is make sure that you have a lot of content on your website
1hmyxtfhrzw_13-3-rgb_front make sure that the users here come into your website are going to see something and be interested in what they are reading and are finding what they are looking for
1hmyxtfhrzw_14-3-rgb_front and that you can do that by having good well separated paragraphs of texts that are separated by headings and explain exactly what you are trying to do what you are trying to get out there for your customers
1hmyxtfhrzw_15-3-rgb_front my name is dave andrews and i just gave you some tips for creating a website
1hmyxtfhrzw_2-3-rgb_front let is go to our computer and i am just going to pull up my website here
1hmyxtfhrzw_3-3-rgb_front and i am going to give you a little bit of explanation on some of the decisions i made
1hmyxtfhrzw_4-3-rgb_front and also why they might be a good choice for you to make
1hmyxtfhrzw_5-3-rgb_front now if you are looking at my website a couple of things that i think are good to do when you are designing a website is first of all make sure that the background colors on your website contrasts with the color of the texts
1hmyxtfhrzw_6-3-rgb_front that way it is nice and readable for the people that are visiting your website
1hmyxtfhrzw_7-3-rgb_front they do not have to squint you know if i had made this sort of like a light gray on my text or something it would be nearly impossible to read
1hmyxtfhrzw_8-3-rgb_front and you know the purpose of your website is to get what you are trying to portray to your audience try to make that to where they can see it and read it so it is just a good idea to have some contrasting colors for that
1hmyxtfhrzw_9-3-rgb_front now another tip is to make sure that your navigation is easily visible and it is very obvious what each of your navigation items do

1i3dinytede_1-8-rgb_front so we have done three movement and now we are going to do the second set of kicks
1i3dinytede_10-8-rgb_front so that is four movements you have just learned
1i3dinytede_2-8-rgb_front it is actually the same kick but we are going to add a little bit more by bringing our arms out
1i3dinytede_3-8-rgb_front you see these muscles
1i3dinytede_4-8-rgb_front we are going to gage those by bringing those arms out
1i3dinytede_5-8-rgb_front you do this for a couple of hours and you will gain some serious muscles
1i3dinytede_6-8-rgb_front so it is just simple bring your arms out and do the same kick but in this case go forward where the leg goes in front of the arms and then in back in back now this part of the routine is about control
1i3dinytede_7-8-rgb_front you have to have some serious control and then back
1i3dinytede_8-8-rgb_front again always use your stomach to control yourself and to keep your arms up like this takes a lot of shoulder muscles back muscles

1ijg1tm5q1w_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is lincoln ward
1ijg1tm5q1w_1-8-rgb_front i am a uspta certified teaching pro also the director of the austin tennis center here in austin texas
1ijg1tm5q1w_10-8-rgb_front that that clamp does not hold a tension quite as well
1ijg1tm5q1w_11-8-rgb_front and then the rotating clamp which you can which is a part of your stringing machine but you can rotate it and to different positions for the manes and the crosses
1ijg1tm5q1w_12-8-rgb_front my name is lincoln ward and that is a little bit about stringing machines
1ijg1tm5q1w_2-8-rgb_front today i am going to talk to you about stringing machines
1ijg1tm5q1w_3-8-rgb_front there is a wide variety of stringing machines out there which can generally be broken down in to three different portions the mounting system the tension system and the clamping system
1ijg1tm5q1w_4-8-rgb_front first off the mounting system comes in either two four or six arm divisions
1ijg1tm5q1w_5-8-rgb_front they they all will hold your racket and just depending on what you prefer to to use
1ijg1tm5q1w_6-8-rgb_front the tension system is one of three different systems a manual hand crank system a a tension pulling system which is electric as well as a drop weight system which can either be electric or manual
1ijg1tm5q1w_7-8-rgb_front the third different the third type or category is the clamping system
1ijg1tm5q1w_8-8-rgb_front the clamps you use to hold your racket are either a a stationary clamp which you you take two different clamps and they are actually a part of the the stringing machine and they they are clamped to both ends of the racket as you pull a tension
1ijg1tm5q1w_9-8-rgb_front the second type is a free it is a free standing clamp which is not connected at all you just hold it you just clamp it to the different edges of your racket to string
1inzfyho0yc_0-11-rgb_front here is a good little trick that you can impress your friends with or even your parents
1inzfyho0yc_1-11-rgb_front i wrote it down so that i do not forget any of the steps
1inzfyho0yc_10-11-rgb_front let is subtract four
1inzfyho0yc_11-11-rgb_front we get
1inzfyho0yc_12-11-rgb_front divide by two
1inzfyho0yc_13-11-rgb_front we get twelve and now subtract the number you started with which was nine and you will see that you will get a three
1inzfyho0yc_14-11-rgb_front so no matter what number you choose you will always get a three and the reason for that is this is the foundation for algebra
1inzfyho0yc_15-11-rgb_front whatever you do to one side you do to the other basic rule in algebra
1inzfyho0yc_2-11-rgb_front choose a number
1inzfyho0yc_3-11-rgb_front do not tell anyone what the number is
1inzfyho0yc_4-11-rgb_front add five to that number double the result then subtract four then divide by two the answer that you get here subtract the number that you started with and you will always see that the result will always be three and you can check that with any number
1inzfyho0yc_5-11-rgb_front for example let is say that the number you chose is nine
1inzfyho0yc_6-11-rgb_front let is add five
1inzfyho0yc_7-11-rgb_front we get fourteen
1inzfyho0yc_8-11-rgb_front let is double that result
1inzfyho0yc_9-11-rgb_front that becomes
1iq5dtfbgt4_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is mary thinnes and i am a skin care expert
1iq5dtfbgt4_1-8-rgb_front we discuss with you now pre instructions that are appropriate for getting the best results
1iq5dtfbgt4_10-8-rgb_front you also do not want to do any any waxing prior to getting a peel
1iq5dtfbgt4_11-8-rgb_front and those are just things you to need to keep in mind before actually doing a chemical peel
1iq5dtfbgt4_2-8-rgb_front you want to actually prep your skin two weeks prior to getting your first chemical peel
1iq5dtfbgt4_3-8-rgb_front and by prepping the skin at home what i mean is you know if you have hyper pigmentation you want to use your lightning creams that i mentioned before
1iq5dtfbgt4_4-8-rgb_front you also want to start doing your papayas papayas at home
1iq5dtfbgt4_5-8-rgb_front you can actually do this at home and leave it on for twenty minutes without steam and that actually will help break up those dead skin cells
1iq5dtfbgt4_6-8-rgb_front obviously you do not want to do this every night because then you will get a really deep peel when you actually do the peel
1iq5dtfbgt4_7-8-rgb_front you want to do it like once every third night and the papaya maybe twice a week for those two weeks
1iq5dtfbgt4_8-8-rgb_front also you want to stay out of the sun
1iq5dtfbgt4_9-8-rgb_front tanned skin actually is not a good skin to do a peel on or burned skin for that matter because its so sensitive
1ia4jmycnyk_1-8-rgb_front women spend a lot of money and a lot of time trying to find the perfect tools for their hair
1ia4jmycnyk_10-8-rgb_front this section can grab half of her hair no matter the length in one thing
1ia4jmycnyk_11-8-rgb_front it is working with less time on you and less energy
1ia4jmycnyk_12-8-rgb_front another great straightening tool is the flat brush which many people do not appreciate
1ia4jmycnyk_13-8-rgb_front if you grab this section of hair you can clip it together and pull down
1ia4jmycnyk_14-8-rgb_front it gives you that straight iron effect and smoothness without having to use such intense heat that the straight iron has
1ia4jmycnyk_2-8-rgb_front what you want to look for when you look for a brush is the diameter of the brush
1ia4jmycnyk_3-8-rgb_front for somebody with long hair this diameter is going to get more tangled
1ia4jmycnyk_4-8-rgb_front once you go through and try to brush your hair out it is going to get stuck within the masses of hair for your length
1ia4jmycnyk_5-8-rgb_front what you can use is a brush like this for in long hair is for the ends which would be your finishing look
1ia4jmycnyk_6-8-rgb_front you can roll your ends in order to achieve that rolling end rounding the face or you can use in order to get more of that flip
1ia4jmycnyk_7-8-rgb_front somebody with long hair who is looking for a straighter look we go for a large diameter brush
1ia4jmycnyk_8-8-rgb_front the larger the diameter of the brush the larger the section that you can take
1ia4jmycnyk_9-8-rgb_front if you can grab the hair with the brush then you can blow it out

1ib_nnort6a_17-8-rgb_front but and i have it alot of times i will shut it and use it for a little table
1ib_nnort6a_18-8-rgb_front what you want to do is if you have pieces like this if you have things that have tops on them that you have stored in those containers you want to open them up and look in them
1ib_nnort6a_19-8-rgb_front because there could be a full chest that i really want to get rid of but if i do not look in it i am going to forget that i have these things
1ib_nnort6a_2-8-rgb_front so first what you want to do is go through each room each area basements attics and look
1ib_nnort6a_20-8-rgb_front so if i am going to the trouble of having a garage sale or doing all this you really want to go through and pull out all the drawers boxes take the tops off and look to see what you have where you will not miss anything
1ib_nnort6a_21-8-rgb_front this is ann myrick and that is how to get rid of what you do not want
1ib_nnort6a_3-8-rgb_front and you want to have pencil in hand with paper and you want to just make a list
1ib_nnort6a_4-8-rgb_front i would write down each room
1ib_nnort6a_5-8-rgb_front i would write down what you want to get rid of in that room
1ib_nnort6a_6-8-rgb_front and then how do you want to get rid of it
1ib_nnort6a_7-8-rgb_front do you want to there is probably going to be several different ways
1ib_nnort6a_8-8-rgb_front there is probably going to be a box or a sack for garbage
1ib_nnort6a_9_10-8-rgb_front there is probably going to be a box or a sack for goodwill or salvation army or your favorite charity or there is also probably going to be a box or could be a box if you want to make a little extra money for a garage sale

1ihegstohfw_6-3-rgb_front or you can take it right click and then delete it
1ihegstohfw_7-3-rgb_front or you can just drag it into the garbage can or the recycle bin as they call it
1ihegstohfw_8-3-rgb_front and there you go it is pretty simple
1ihegstohfw_9-3-rgb_front and that is again how microsoft does pretty much everything
1ikv8ivfpbw_0-8-rgb_front all right now we are going to start applying mud
1ikv8ivfpbw_1-8-rgb_front now the first step in applying mud is making sure we put tape on all the joints and cracks
1ikv8ivfpbw_10-8-rgb_front that is pretty much what taping is
1ikv8ivfpbw_2-8-rgb_front the reason for this is so that if the house shakes or settles or moves or something like that your joints are protected from cracking
1ikv8ivfpbw_3-8-rgb_front so here we go
1ikv8ivfpbw_4-8-rgb_front now all of these mesh tapes have one side that has glue on it and one side that does not
1ikv8ivfpbw_5-8-rgb_front put the glue side to the drywall and press it on and use your razor knife to cut it when your done
1ikv8ivfpbw_6-8-rgb_front do the same thing in all corners
1ikv8ivfpbw_7-8-rgb_front i like to lay the tape out on the corner and then use my fingers to press it in to the corner so that i get a nice stick on both sides both the top and the bottom
1ikv8ivfpbw_8-8-rgb_front now we are only going to do just a little place here to show you how to do this and then we are going to move on in to mudding
1ikv8ivfpbw_9-8-rgb_front all the corners get done all the joints get done and all the edges of your corner bead should get done too
1imak8edk5q_0-8-rgb_front hi i am les whitley
1imak8edk5q_1-8-rgb_front i would like to talk to you right now about how to slim the waist
1imak8edk5q_10-8-rgb_front do a variety of different exercises as your abdominal and mid section as well as your core is used in almost everything that you do it gets trained frequently throughout the day
1imak8edk5q_11-8-rgb_front so take time focus add that healthy diet as well as regular exercise to your routine to achieve that nice slim waist
1imak8edk5q_2-8-rgb_front the waist or the mid section abdominals or commonly called the core can be slimmed in several different ways
1imak8edk5q_3-8-rgb_front most importantly by minimizing the amount of body fat that is covering the musculature of the structure itself
1imak8edk5q_4-8-rgb_front toning the muscles and keeping the muscles tight will help pull them in so they act like a natural girdle for the body
1imak8edk5q_5-8-rgb_front reducing the amount of body fat overlying that tissue would help again slim that area to give it overall appearance of a leaner stronger mid section
1imak8edk5q_6-8-rgb_front by strengthening and toning the rest of the muscles of your body will give you a nice overall look which gives you nice strong shoulders and upper body a good balanced lower body for strength and development there but then maximizing that narrow waist by modifying your diet so that it is overall adding to your health as well as increasing your level of activity to achieve maximum results
1imak8edk5q_7-8-rgb_front spend time doing abdominal exercises that target all aspects moving the core and training the core as one
1imak8edk5q_8-8-rgb_front after all it is the connection between your upper body and your lower body
1imak8edk5q_9-8-rgb_front and it is not necessarily one specific isolation exercise that is going to provide everything that you need
1in4nilbtxc_0-8-rgb_front alright
1in4nilbtxc_1-8-rgb_front most guys put a little bit of hockey tape on there for you
1in4nilbtxc_10-8-rgb_front make a knob there just so the stick won t come out of my hand
1in4nilbtxc_11-8-rgb_front and there you go
1in4nilbtxc_12-8-rgb_front just a nice little tape job just as big as my hand
1in4nilbtxc_2-8-rgb_front everybody is got their own style
1in4nilbtxc_3-8-rgb_front i like to i mean pretty much your just getting a better grip with the tape on there and you do not want to lose the stick
1in4nilbtxc_4-8-rgb_front i do a little twist here like this
1in4nilbtxc_5-8-rgb_front it kind of forms to your fingers and just work it back up
1in4nilbtxc_6-8-rgb_front some guys will go a little bit farther down it is just personal preference
1in4nilbtxc_7-8-rgb_front i mean it is not that big a deal really
1in4nilbtxc_8-8-rgb_front just work your way up though
1in4nilbtxc_9-8-rgb_front when i get to the top i like to make a nice little knob here wrap it around a couple more times
1inalz6i4pe_0-11-rgb_front another way that you need to consider affecting your light whether you are inside or outside is how you can control it
1inalz6i4pe_1-11-rgb_front so right now as i said we are using this garage light and it is very easy for me to control it i just point it away from my model if i want
1inalz6i4pe_2-11-rgb_front or i can reflect it or i can use the black side of a card like this this is called a flag
1inalz6i4pe_3-11-rgb_front so whether i am using the garage light and you want to cover up a certain thing i can also flag the skylight so even if i am outside i can provide some shade for my model
1inalz6i4pe_4-11-rgb_front which may or may not have a pleasant effect i mean obviously she seems just a little bit too shaded here
1inalz6i4pe_5-11-rgb_front or i can take this skylight and i can put the reflector under her and light her face up this way
1inalz6i4pe_6-11-rgb_front so even if you are outdoors and all you have is the sunlight there are a lot of ways you can control and effect that light
1inalz6i4pe_7-11-rgb_front so just think about those kinds of things when you are doing portraits or even landscape shots
1j2bqo1pxwq_1-5-rgb_front and again what you need to do is take the skin potato and take out the peel the way i am doing it right now
1j2bqo1pxwq_2-5-rgb_front you just need to take the peel that is the brown part use your hands since it is a boiled potato you are not to use a knife
1j2bqo1pxwq_3-5-rgb_front but of course the knife will be used partly when you have to cut the tomatoes for the stuffing part
1j2bqo1pxwq_4-5-rgb_front so here is our second potato we need to take our third potato
1j2bqo1pxwq_5-5-rgb_front whenever you are boiling potatoes try to mix more potatoes because they get kind of softened early as well you will get your potatoes softened very easily
1j2bqo1pxwq_6-5-rgb_front so get it in a habit whenever you are making vegetables and you need potatoes as if like you are making cauliflower or potato vegetable you can just not need to boil your vegetable
1j2bqo1pxwq_7-5-rgb_front but if you are making a recipe like stuffed tomatoes you need to boil your potato properly
1j2bqo1pxwq_8-5-rgb_front so i kind of boiled my potatoes and i am just taking the peel out there it goes
1j2bqo1pxwq_9-5-rgb_front and i think i am almost done with the peel of the third potato
1jafrrku4ic_0-8-rgb_front now i am going to show you how to prepare your frame to create your aged frames
1jafrrku4ic_1-8-rgb_front all the frames that you buy that are stained will have a more or less glossy finish on them
1jafrrku4ic_10-8-rgb_front once that is done you just take a damp paper towel is fine and just lightly brush it all off to get off the sand that you just created
1jafrrku4ic_11-8-rgb_front the varnish and the dirt and that type of thing
1jafrrku4ic_12-8-rgb_front because you do not want that mixed into your paint
1jafrrku4ic_13-8-rgb_front so you just make sure that you wipe all of the grooves off like this so it is clean everywhere that you are going to paint
1jafrrku4ic_14-8-rgb_front and then let it dry for a few minutes
1jafrrku4ic_15-8-rgb_front you can wipe it off to get any extra moisture
1jafrrku4ic_16-8-rgb_front but then you might want to wait just a few minutes for that to completely dry before you paint
1jafrrku4ic_2-8-rgb_front to avoid having to use a primer on this particular project all you need to do is take a medium sandpaper
1jafrrku4ic_3-8-rgb_front i think this one is number
1jafrrku4ic_4-8-rgb_front anyway you just take it and you just sand the areas that you are going to be painting
1jafrrku4ic_5-8-rgb_front and it is okay if you sand some of that paint off because you are base coat will take care of that
1jafrrku4ic_6-8-rgb_front just make sure that you sand anywhere that it is still shiny just to give you an idea of how this goes
1jafrrku4ic_7-8-rgb_front and again something like this you have a lot more detail to work with
1jafrrku4ic_8-8-rgb_front that is another thing you might want to keep in mind
1jafrrku4ic_9-8-rgb_front if you need to sand something like the other frame with the pewter you might want to mask off any off the molding that you do not want sanded and then just proceed to sand and rough up the surface
1jixtnchoxk_0-8-rgb_front i am ivan madar
1jixtnchoxk_2-8-rgb_front those are the basic principles wider stance hands to the side
1jixtnchoxk_3-8-rgb_front the next thing is going to be position and angles of my main joints
1jixtnchoxk_4-8-rgb_front the joints again from the side would be the ankle this flexion your knees and hips
1jixtnchoxk_5-8-rgb_front now what is the ideal stance
1jixtnchoxk_6-8-rgb_front again the ideal stance is when the pressure goes down on your feet rather than going forward or going backward
1jixtnchoxk_7-8-rgb_front so we slightly flex our ankles push our knees forward and are slightly flexed at our hips with our hands to the side
1jixtnchoxk_8-8-rgb_front now this is still comfortable here
1jixtnchoxk_9-8-rgb_front if you bounce in this position that is the position in which you will do a lot of the either the beginner or advanced drills in skiing
1jj4ez4wy1g_0-8-rgb_front so i am going to go over the supplies that you will need to create this beach party look
1jj4ez4wy1g_1-8-rgb_front the first thing we are going to use is some foundation primer to help our foundation stay on a lot better
1jj4ez4wy1g_2-8-rgb_front we are actually going to mix together a liquid highlighter and our liquid foundation to give the skin a really nice dewy glow
1jj4ez4wy1g_3-8-rgb_front we are going to use some bronzer mixed with some peach blush
1jj4ez4wy1g_4-8-rgb_front for the eyes we are going to mix together some liners we are going to mix together a bronze and a plum liner
1jreuw8hcay_0-8-rgb_front hi i am kelli and i am an aesthetician and makeup artist at ulta salon and cosmetics and i am going to give you some tips to clear skin
1jreuw8hcay_1-8-rgb_front basically the easiest way to remember what to do is to look at the acronym for acne
1jreuw8hcay_10-8-rgb_front it is going to lead to inflammation and it is going to lead to scarring but you do want to make sure that exfoliate
1jreuw8hcay_11-8-rgb_front anybody with acneic skin produces up to four times the amount of dead skin cells of the person with average skin so you want to definitely make sure that you use a lot of exfoliating products
1jreuw8hcay_12-8-rgb_front i like to use salicylic acid for those types of exfoliation because chemical exfoliants helps keep the pores really nice and clean and helps to control the oil and are nonirritating
1jreuw8hcay_13-8-rgb_front so those are some things you can do for clear skin
1jreuw8hcay_2-8-rgb_front basically what you want to do is make sure you are using antibacterial products make sure you are using a really good antibacterial cleanser
1jreuw8hcay_3-8-rgb_front basically what causes acne is when you have dirt and debris and oil clogged within a pore and it becomes infected by that p acne bacteria
1jreuw8hcay_4-8-rgb_front so just by using antibacterial products to help to kill that p acne bacteria you are going to lessen the likelihood of breakout
1jreuw8hcay_5-8-rgb_front you also want to use oil controlling products typically acneic skin is caused from an over production of oil so just by using oil free products hydrating products and products like something like microsponging it or something that is going to be oil controlling definitely help
1jreuw8hcay_6-8-rgb_front salicylic acid is a really great ingredient for that as well
1jreuw8hcay_7-8-rgb_front you also want to use nonirritating products
1jreuw8hcay_8-8-rgb_front you never want to use anything that is abrasive on the skin or anything that is going to overstrip the skin or you never want to scrub over an open blemish
1jreuw8hcay_9-8-rgb_front that is just going to spread the bacteria
1jvox59inmu_0-11-rgb_front ok i have my cornmeal my beaten egg add just a cup of sugar just to sweeten it up
1jvox59inmu_1-11-rgb_front it is not going to be sweet like a corn muffin or anything but cornmeal is pretty not sweet it is going to be a little sugar in there
1jvox59inmu_10-11-rgb_front still a little thick so i am going to add just a little bit more of the milk
1jvox59inmu_11-11-rgb_front so that is just over a cup what i added
1jvox59inmu_12-11-rgb_front you know depending on how big of a batch you want to make of this double it
1jvox59inmu_13-11-rgb_front you know use cups of the cornmeal and you know just double everything else from there
1jvox59inmu_14-11-rgb_front alright that is looking pretty good about where i want it
1jvox59inmu_15-11-rgb_front see the consistency nice
1jvox59inmu_16-11-rgb_front this is not a huge batch of cornbread really is not
1jvox59inmu_17-11-rgb_front so it is going to just be really thin in this pan but that is ok and again it is going to cook up quickly and it is not going to matter because we are going to break it up and put it in our larger dish anyway so it is does not even matter
1jvox59inmu_18-11-rgb_front we get this pan so we can get in the oven
1jvox59inmu_2-11-rgb_front cup of sugar cup of vegetable oil just kind of combine and bring that together
1jvox59inmu_3-11-rgb_front we are going to add some milk we are going to mearsure out a cup and i am going to add it slowly
1jvox59inmu_4-11-rgb_front just ot kind of see how much we need i am going to start with about a cup
1jvox59inmu_5-11-rgb_front let is just start with a cup
1jvox59inmu_6_7_8-11-rgb_front mix this together and see yeah we may not even need much more than that yeah that is coming together nicely beautifully kind of see how that is coming together starting to look like cornbread
1jvox59inmu_9-11-rgb_front well cornbread batter get a good look at that
1jwbf4jhzga_1-8-rgb_front okay
1jwbf4jhzga_10-8-rgb_front i will show you how you snap this side in and then we will be done
1jwbf4jhzga_2-8-rgb_front what i have done is i have just losing them up so they slide back and forth because i want to mount the door and make sure that it fits correctly and then we are going to go ahead and adjust these to where we want them and then we go ahead and retighten the screws
1jwbf4jhzga_3-8-rgb_front first thing you want to do is get your top one in over here
1jwbf4jhzga_4-8-rgb_front this pin is going to go into this hole because you want to make sure to get that pin in like so and then your bottom one into the little triangle
1jwbf4jhzga_5_6_7-8-rgb_front you may have to use your hand to feel that it is in okay but there it is in and you going to see that our door is not fitting so we are going to have to adjust our brackets on either side that is why i left them loose
1jwbf4jhzga_8-8-rgb_front so you see i can push it over
1jwbf4jhzga_9-8-rgb_front now i have made the clearance that we need for this side and we are going to go ahead and tighten this up right there
1jyzfgvz9ym_1-8-rgb_front today we are doing a home gym work out
1jyzfgvz9ym_2-8-rgb_front we have already done most of our body parts and what we are working on right now is our shoulder muscles
1jyzfgvz9ym_3-8-rgb_front we have got an exercise for the front part of our delt which is called the anterior straight out lifts and now we are going to concentrate on the middle or the medial part of our arm and build this muscle right here
1jyzfgvz9ym_4-8-rgb_front what we are going to do is we are going to take our dumbbells and we are going to start from the side nice stance bent knees and what we are going to do is go straight up and down straight up and down
1jyzfgvz9ym_5-8-rgb_front you want to have your elbows bent a little bit and you want to take this up about ear height boom right there nice controlled motion up controlled down explosion up and down straight up and down
1jyzfgvz9ym_6-8-rgb_front you want to have your elbows bent a little bit and you want to take this up about ear height boom right there nice controlled motion up controlled down explosion up and down
1jyzfgvz9ym_7-8-rgb_front and again this is going to work the side or medial part of your delt
1jek8pkhsr4_0-8-rgb_front the next area i want to talk about is one that i am particular proud of myself pretty much designed this under my own thinking
1jek8pkhsr4_1-8-rgb_front what we have here is what i am going to call the small head target mirrors
1jek8pkhsr4_11-8-rgb_front they do not train at bill is gym so you can bet that their face is going to still be here while your face is down a little bit lower and out of the head target mirror
1jek8pkhsr4_12-8-rgb_front when you step back again it is ok to have your face in the mirror
1jek8pkhsr4_13-8-rgb_front they can not hit you you can not hit them
1jek8pkhsr4_14-8-rgb_front you are half a step away this is where you need to relax
1jek8pkhsr4_15-8-rgb_front so as we step forward we are bending down
1jek8pkhsr4_16-8-rgb_front we are getting out of the mirror
1jek8pkhsr4_17_18-8-rgb_front ok and not only is that good for just a jab but it is also good as you can see for the one two left right
1jek8pkhsr4_19_20_21-8-rgb_front ok we start throwing now one two two rights again keep your face out of the mirror so four different height mirrors for four different boxers
1jek8pkhsr4_2-8-rgb_front i have got four foot square mirrors adjusted a little bit different heights on the wall here
1jek8pkhsr4_22-8-rgb_front even this one here for the younger boxers
1jek8pkhsr4_23-8-rgb_front actually i had to draw a little circle in the mirror
1jek8pkhsr4_24-8-rgb_front because they were so small that they were covering the whole mirror
1jek8pkhsr4_25-8-rgb_front so again it is one of the few times where being having your face directly in the mirror is not a good thing
1jek8pkhsr4_26-8-rgb_front thanks
1jek8pkhsr4_3-8-rgb_front and what i have my boxers do is pick one that is approximately their face is dead center of that mirror
1jek8pkhsr4_4-8-rgb_front what we do is is i tell them if you take a step back from the mirror
1jek8pkhsr4_5-8-rgb_front as you punch yourself in the face you can simulate that being another boxer punching you
1jek8pkhsr4_6-8-rgb_front so as you step forward and your fist comes almost directly into your face you can expect that other boxer to be punching you
1jek8pkhsr4_7-8-rgb_front so what we are trying to do is get your face out of the target out of the head target mirror
1jek8pkhsr4_8-8-rgb_front ok
1jek8pkhsr4_9_10-8-rgb_front so as we are stepping forward we are going to bend at the knees and get our face out of the mirror ok our first on the other hand is still going directly into mirror directly into their face
1jopnyrkt78_0-8-rgb_front ok remember that when you are sitting in a stool it is a little bit different than sitting in a chair on the floor
1jopnyrkt78_1-8-rgb_front so what i want you to do is once again think about your legs ladies
1jopnyrkt78_10-8-rgb_front than you do a chair on the floor because your feet are now lifted from the floor
1jopnyrkt78_11-8-rgb_front so you are unable to keep that security with your feet on the floor
1jopnyrkt78_12-8-rgb_front this is why you want to keep the right foot in front
1jopnyrkt78_13-8-rgb_front the left one behind and a little bit of placement with the feet diagonal
1jopnyrkt78_14-8-rgb_front on the right side of the chair here
1jopnyrkt78_15-8-rgb_front while i rest my hands on the left hip
1jopnyrkt78_16-8-rgb_front so it gives your body balance and a lot of security while sitting high up in a stool
1jopnyrkt78_17-8-rgb_front which is raised up off the floor
1jopnyrkt78_2-8-rgb_front keep the knees together
1jopnyrkt78_3-8-rgb_front keep the legs crossed
1jopnyrkt78_4-8-rgb_front ladies keep in mind i keep my right foot in front
1jopnyrkt78_5-8-rgb_front i place my left foot behind the right and then i place it on the step of the stool
1jopnyrkt78_6-8-rgb_front resting the legs this feels much more comfortable than dangling or them with the knees apart
1jopnyrkt78_7-8-rgb_front which is very unattractive as we know
1jopnyrkt78_8-8-rgb_front so keep your hands again to the side
1jopnyrkt78_9-8-rgb_front keep your posture maintain it and in a stool your going to find you are going to sit a little bit deeper into the seat of the chair
1jx2abn_2_u_1-8-rgb_front welcome back
1jx2abn_2_u_10-8-rgb_front the little gold circles
1jx2abn_2_u_11-8-rgb_front and that just represents any of the fat that is come to the top
1jx2abn_2_u_12-8-rgb_front you just go around the edges not to confuse it with air bubbles because you will see like it gets white and frothy around the edges of the pot on the inside
1jx2abn_2_u_13-8-rgb_front that is just air bubbles as the water is boiling so do not let that fool you
1jx2abn_2_u_14-8-rgb_front and you just go around and skim any off
1jx2abn_2_u_15-8-rgb_front we have done really well actually
1jx2abn_2_u_16-8-rgb_front we are very fortunate
1jx2abn_2_u_17-8-rgb_front we do not have that much to worry about
1jx2abn_2_u_18-8-rgb_front in the meantime just gonna stir the noodles
1jx2abn_2_u_19-8-rgb_front i think they are just about ready to put in the colander
1jx2abn_2_u_2-8-rgb_front in our next step we will be skimming off any of the grease or fat that is risen to the top
1jx2abn_2_u_20-8-rgb_front we will just put the lid back on here a second
1jx2abn_2_u_21-8-rgb_front let is bring the noodles over and pour them into the colander
1jx2abn_2_u_22-8-rgb_front that is a trick i always do when i put the noodles in the colander
1jx2abn_2_u_23-8-rgb_front you see the steam that comes up
1jx2abn_2_u_24-8-rgb_front i always pull across
1jx2abn_2_u_25-8-rgb_front keeps the steam away from my face
1jx2abn_2_u_26-8-rgb_front and just rinse them off a little bit
1jx2abn_2_u_27-8-rgb_front let soak in the pot the corning ware just a second
1jx2abn_2_u_28-8-rgb_front now we will check the soup one more time
1jx2abn_2_u_29-8-rgb_front any more skimming to do
1jx2abn_2_u_3-8-rgb_front remember i said how important it was to clean the chicken and try to get off as much of the fat as you could
1jx2abn_2_u_30-8-rgb_front let is just turn that off
1jx2abn_2_u_31-8-rgb_front o k one more time around the pot we should be good to go
1jx2abn_2_u_32-8-rgb_front in the meantime the pot on the back of the stove i am getting the water ready to do the matza balls in there
1jx2abn_2_u_33-8-rgb_front it all takes time when you have got to kind of coordinate the time to get your pots and water boiling
1jx2abn_2_u_4-8-rgb_front that was so you would not have as much to skim off the top
1jx2abn_2_u_5-8-rgb_front we have done a really good job of cleaning the chicken
1jx2abn_2_u_6-8-rgb_front we do not have all that much to do
1jx2abn_2_u_7-8-rgb_front all you do is run your ladle or spoon around the edges
1jx2abn_2_u_8-8-rgb_front and any little grease patches just come off as little gold spots on top of the water
1jx2abn_2_u_9-8-rgb_front i am sure you have seen them in soup
1jzalqtjpca_0-8-rgb_front we have all the pieces we need for our body and also our head rolled and taped
1jzalqtjpca_1-8-rgb_front so now we need to line it up and we are going to do that by and this is a great part for the kids to do just find the rolls and how they gradually go down in size
1jzalqtjpca_2-8-rgb_front so we can go and compare all the way down where they fit in because we want them to kind of go from largest at the top to smallest at the bottom which will sort of create that gradual effect of head body and then tail
1jzalqtjpca_3-8-rgb_front so here is our outline for our dragonfly body and what we will do now is take those longer pieces of tape that we had ready from the beginning we are going to roll those and they are going to go right along the backside here right where we put the tape on when we attached the loops and we are going to press them down
1jzalqtjpca_4-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that that tape is on there firmly and do the next one
1jzalqtjpca_5-8-rgb_front and we are just going to keep going all the way up and we are going to do and this is a tougher part for the kids to do but they will get the hang of it it is a good lesson
1jzalqtjpca_6-8-rgb_front we are going to push it down and we are using the guideline that we put on originally we can always move these around if they are not quite where we want them
1jzalqtjpca_7-8-rgb_front we are going to do that all the way up to the head
1jzqa7pnitu_0-3-rgb_front we are talking about maps now
1jzqa7pnitu_1-3-rgb_front it helps to know which way to go when you are out there
1jzqa7pnitu_10-3-rgb_front it is going to have a legend that tells you what all the symbols are on the map
1jzqa7pnitu_11-3-rgb_front it is going to have a scale to give you an idea of distance
1jzqa7pnitu_12-3-rgb_front on the map it will have like little lines
1jzqa7pnitu_13-3-rgb_front those are the contour lines tells you the elevation of different parts
1jzqa7pnitu_14-3-rgb_front right here this has a really nice feature a profile
1jzqa7pnitu_15-3-rgb_front it gives you an idea of the elevation increases judging that by mileage and where on those you are going to find water shelter and things like that
1jzqa7pnitu_16-3-rgb_front so it helps to familiarize yourself with the map before you go out and know what you are going to get into
1jzqa7pnitu_17-3-rgb_front if you have any questions give your local outfitter a holler
1jzqa7pnitu_2-3-rgb_front this particular map is for the appalachian trail
1jzqa7pnitu_3-3-rgb_front a lot of trails are marked with paint blazes
1jzqa7pnitu_4-3-rgb_front they will have like a little paint blaze a little rectangle on each tree
1jzqa7pnitu_5-3-rgb_front and you go to one look for the next and go to the next
1jzqa7pnitu_6-3-rgb_front but it is nice to have a map to kind of give you an idea what is off the trail
1jzqa7pnitu_7-3-rgb_front particularly handy if you need to do an evacuation and get out quick
1jzqa7pnitu_8-3-rgb_front it is also handy in kind of setting yourself up mentally for what you are about to prepare
1jzqa7pnitu_9-3-rgb_front a map is going to have a number of things
1k093vlwd9g_0-8-rgb_front so that you can go home or obviously you are at home but so can start doing this tonight the first thing that we will do is build a scrap file
1k093vlwd9g_1-8-rgb_front to build a scrap file you are going to need a supply of magazines that you do not care about they are not the library is they are your own that you can cut up
1k093vlwd9g_10-8-rgb_front belts shoes purses whatever
1k093vlwd9g_11-8-rgb_front you want every single aspect of the form of the body that you can look at and begin to reference your own drawings from
1k093vlwd9g_2-8-rgb_front books a good place or you can go get books at a resell place any place that has picture books anything
1k093vlwd9g_3-8-rgb_front anything that is visually appealing to you and visually stimulating that you can cut up you are going to need to have that compiled in front of you and then you start looking through those things
1k093vlwd9g_4-8-rgb_front keep in mind you are going to be pulling design elements to create clothing and the first part of that is drawing the actual female form that the clothing is going to be displayed on
1k093vlwd9g_5-8-rgb_front and in order to do that you need to have images from several different categories
1k093vlwd9g_6-8-rgb_front the first thing you are going to need to do is have images of the full fashion figure whether you are going to be menswear or wear i am only going to talk about wear cause that is all i do
1k093vlwd9g_7-8-rgb_front so you need the full body you need ads from magazines that are a full person
1k093vlwd9g_8-8-rgb_front then you need ads that are close up of the head that way you can see the details
1k093vlwd9g_9-8-rgb_front you want to get ads that are accessories you are going to have accessories in your collection
1kabqm38yjw_0-8-rgb_front now we will talk a little bit about the sizing of these systems
1kabqm38yjw_1-8-rgb_front it depends on what you want to actually run and of course how much money you have
1kabqm38yjw_2-8-rgb_front we are going to go on the smaller side just today
1kabqm38yjw_3-8-rgb_front if you are trying to power your whole house and you had air conditioning and stoves and lighting and computers and the normal things a normal house has and you wanted to run it all by solar you would be using quite a few of these or these and some of the systems we install have up to seventy panels or more and unfortunately they are maybe a thousand dollars each so you can see the price goes up with the amount of load you wish to take over
1kabqm38yjw_4-8-rgb_front in our system here my plan is to take my home office off the grid and just power up some laptops and entertainment equipment so we are going to be using a fairly small system
1kabqm38yjw_5-8-rgb_front one or two of these hundred and forty watt panels charging a bank of perhaps four six volt batteries and that will give us enough power to run quite a few lights my laptop and some entertainment equipment from the power of the sun
1kbycmfljlm_0-8-rgb_front kirk vickers the next series of movements that we are going to do the series and movements and exercises are going to be explosive strength power and even some plyometric movements and motions
1kbycmfljlm_1-8-rgb_front the first exercise that we are going to do is what is called the dynamic scissor lunge
1kbycmfljlm_2-8-rgb_front again this is something that is considered to be a little more advanced and this is not a beginner move
1kbycmfljlm_3-8-rgb_front but we are going to start here into a lunge position and we are going to do what is called the scissor lunge
1kbycmfljlm_4-8-rgb_front switching position try not to fall forward with our body
1kbycmfljlm_5-8-rgb_front but good position with our feet and our ankles coming all the way through
1kbycmfljlm_6-8-rgb_front you are going to do to of these
1kbycmfljlm_7-8-rgb_front when you are done with these you are going to feel a lot of work through the lower extremity even a little bit of core work right quads the glutes and the hamstrings and even some low leg and ankle with this one
1kmcbhj2ipm_0-8-rgb_front mark blocker in this segment we are going to cover installing the wheel
1kmcbhj2ipm_1-8-rgb_front part of putting the wheel on i just want to remind you what we are showing you for our video training purposes is on the one side of the car
1kmcbhj2ipm_10-8-rgb_front i am just going to put the rotor in straight up and down position so i can readily and easily align the bolts
1kmcbhj2ipm_11-8-rgb_front okay prior to putting on i always put just a light dosage of on the wheels studs and then when i put the nuts on there as i spin in on down that is going to spread that around and it provides a good lubricant and protection against rust
1kmcbhj2ipm_12-8-rgb_front so the next time i have to remove this tire for servicing of any type i have got a good clean bolts are all rusted up and it just assures a good service life of the bolt and the nut because they are located in an environment where they get a lot of water from rain from road
1kmcbhj2ipm_13-8-rgb_front okay
1kmcbhj2ipm_14-8-rgb_front after indiscernible i just go down and start each one
1kmcbhj2ipm_15-8-rgb_front once i get them you can just tighten the rest the way down by finger or the star wrench works a little faster
1kmcbhj2ipm_16-8-rgb_front now you want to make sure you hold that rim on there pretty much flat and tied to the rotor and then dug the nuts down
1kmcbhj2ipm_17-8-rgb_front here is a cheating method
1kmcbhj2ipm_18-8-rgb_front that is a little trick
1kmcbhj2ipm_19-8-rgb_front it takes a little practice but it breaks up the monotony to do the job and put a little fun into things sometimes
1kmcbhj2ipm_2-8-rgb_front the other side of car you just reverse the application or do everything in reverse orders
1kmcbhj2ipm_20-8-rgb_front okay we have completed installing the wheel
1kmcbhj2ipm_21-8-rgb_front please watch our next segment
1kmcbhj2ipm_22-8-rgb_front we will cover installing the lug nuts
1kmcbhj2ipm_3-8-rgb_front and there are two ways you can do this
1kmcbhj2ipm_4-8-rgb_front you can do it step by step as you remove the components on this side you go to the other side and remove the components because you have the tools needed right there in your hands and you are really familiar with it
1kmcbhj2ipm_5-8-rgb_front it is a quick and easy to process that way
1kmcbhj2ipm_6-8-rgb_front but if you have a problem with laying things out or retention or you are just not that familiar you might want to do one side at a time in that way you can always go over and look at the other side see how it is put together because it is still unassembled and it can help you work you through the process to see how everything goes
1kmcbhj2ipm_7-8-rgb_front it just depends on how comfortable you are with the job how familiar you are with the components so you can either do it kinda together or you can do it individually just depends on your comfort level
1kmcbhj2ipm_8-8-rgb_front i will just put that information out to you
1kmcbhj2ipm_9-8-rgb_front we are all ready to go to install the wheel
1kmlu1z5dwm_0-8-rgb_front okay let is talk a little bit about scoring
1kmlu1z5dwm_1-8-rgb_front well a miss a miss is through and that is what you get two balls and whatever you get through that is what it will count
1kmlu1z5dwm_10-8-rgb_front now a turkey is the highest you can get in one frame pins in one frame
1kmlu1z5dwm_11-8-rgb_front if you get pins in the first and pins all the way through to the frame or the frame
1kmlu1z5dwm_12-8-rgb_front it is the object of the game perfection
1kmlu1z5dwm_13-8-rgb_front twelve strikes in a row go and get one
1kmlu1z5dwm_14-8-rgb_front now let is talk a little bit more about scoring
1kmlu1z5dwm_15-8-rgb_front let is go to the other side
1kmlu1z5dwm_16-8-rgb_front now you see was the first ball and then they got that one pin that was left which is a spare
1kmlu1z5dwm_17-8-rgb_front then they got on their first ball a so you add the spare which is and the first ball which is is in the first frame
1kmlu1z5dwm_18-8-rgb_front they missed that one pin which is an open miss open same terminology
1kmlu1z5dwm_19-8-rgb_front so add onto
1kmlu1z5dwm_2-8-rgb_front okay now also we will look at the scoreboard and you will get a spare
1kmlu1z5dwm_20-8-rgb_front same thing in the next frame miss miss
1kmlu1z5dwm_21-8-rgb_front alright when you are scoring sometimes they do not have computers and you have to manually score it
1kmlu1z5dwm_22-8-rgb_front so if you get a strike x if you get a if you make that pin spare slash
1kmlu1z5dwm_23-8-rgb_front open as you saw on the computer is just a line a dash
1kmlu1z5dwm_24-8-rgb_front now if you throw a split well that is and a big zero which means a hole or a split
1kmlu1z5dwm_25-8-rgb_front it is nice to put a slash spare through that split
1kmlu1z5dwm_3-8-rgb_front now a spare you will see see a strike and a spare
1kmlu1z5dwm_4-8-rgb_front so i got a and a spare you see there is
1kmlu1z5dwm_5-8-rgb_front now a spare counts as whatever i get on my first ball which i got a strike which is pins so it is
1kmlu1z5dwm_6-8-rgb_front it is plus the for the spare plus the pins i got on my first ball becomes
1kmlu1z5dwm_7-8-rgb_front then i got a strike then i got a double
1kmlu1z5dwm_8-8-rgb_front a double is two strikes in a row
1kmlu1z5dwm_9-8-rgb_front then i got a triple which is also called a turkey some terminology there
1k_zokhoyje_0-8-rgb_front now i am going to explain a little bit about pirouettes also what we consider turns in dancing
1k_zokhoyje_1-8-rgb_front now one of the most important parts to turns or pirouettes is going to be spotting
1k_zokhoyje_2-8-rgb_front continuous turning obviously i am sure you all know you will get dizzy
1k_zokhoyje_3-8-rgb_front however spotting is a useful tool to keep from being dizzy
1k_zokhoyje_4-8-rgb_front now what you are going to want to do is stand flat on your feet and you are going to want to focus on one specific point
1k_zokhoyje_5-8-rgb_front what you are going to do is start to turn your body but keep your head still and your eyes focused on that one point
1k_zokhoyje_6-8-rgb_front and then when you get to the point where you can not go anymore around you are going to whip your head around and then you are going to continue to walk around until facing forward
1k_zokhoyje_7-8-rgb_front this is the same tool we are going to use when we are turning but you definitely want to do it slowly first to get used to it
1k_zokhoyje_8-8-rgb_front so focus turn whip turn back around and focus again
1l6mc-9bqa0_0-5-rgb_front hi
1l6mc-9bqa0_1-5-rgb_front my name is derek tarnow i have been playing guitar for twelve years and i teach and perform
1l6mc-9bqa0_10-5-rgb_front what i have on here now are actually the classical guitar strings
1l6mc-9bqa0_11-5-rgb_front because it is a classical guitar
1l6mc-9bqa0_12-5-rgb_front over here i have my strap for my electrical guitar
1l6mc-9bqa0_13-5-rgb_front on this guitar i like to to just play just the regular strings for electric guitars
1l6mc-9bqa0_14-5-rgb_front over here i have a hollow body
1l6mc-9bqa0_15-5-rgb_front on this guitar i like to use flat wounds but that is total a preference thing
1l6mc-9bqa0_16-5-rgb_front flat wound strings on most guitars like like your strats or your acoustic guitars you have round wound strings
1l6mc-9bqa0_17-5-rgb_front on the flat wound strings the wrapping or the around the strings is flattened to reduce the fret noise
1l6mc-9bqa0_18-5-rgb_front but again on this guitar i just have the chromes which is just their flat wound series of strings
1l6mc-9bqa0_19-5-rgb_front on my acoustic i do not play acoustic very often so i do not
1l6mc-9bqa0_2-5-rgb_front in this clip i am going to talk about selecting guitar strings
1l6mc-9bqa0_20-5-rgb_front i am not too picky about strings on that
1l6mc-9bqa0_21-5-rgb_front i think for right now actually just martin strings on it because it is a martin guitar
1l6mc-9bqa0_22-5-rgb_front it does not really matter
1l6mc-9bqa0_23-5-rgb_front you do not have to match your guitar with your strings at all
1l6mc-9bqa0_24-5-rgb_front in fact it is usually not a good idea
1l6mc-9bqa0_25-5-rgb_front also an important thing to consider when you are choosing guitar strings is maybe you are playing ability
1l6mc-9bqa0_26-5-rgb_front if you are a beginning student you might want to start with a lighter gage string
1l6mc-9bqa0_27-5-rgb_front if you are younger maybe some eights
1l6mc-9bqa0_28-5-rgb_front if you are a little older like like by older like late middle school really high school get some nine gage strings
1l6mc-9bqa0_29-5-rgb_front your hands can usually handle it
1l6mc-9bqa0_3-5-rgb_front the first thing to decide when selecting guitar strings is you know what guitar you are selecting guitar strings for
1l6mc-9bqa0_30-5-rgb_front also what kind of style you are playing
1l6mc-9bqa0_31-5-rgb_front bluesier guitar players like to play on a little heavier strings then metal players
1l6mc-9bqa0_32-5-rgb_front metal players on really light gage strings
1l6mc-9bqa0_33-5-rgb_front because they get that really shrieky streaking sound that they go for
1l6mc-9bqa0_34-5-rgb_front anyway if you have any questions about guitar strings
1l6mc-9bqa0_35-5-rgb_front generally when you go to a guitar music shop there would be someone there that would know what they are talking about to help you out and to help you choose a set of strings that would get you by
1l6mc-9bqa0_36-5-rgb_front also do not be afraid to experiment and try new strings because that is really the only way that you are going to find out what strings you like or do not like and why
1l6mc-9bqa0_37-5-rgb_front and that is an important thing to know
1l6mc-9bqa0_4-5-rgb_front i got out a couple of different kinds of guitars here
1l6mc-9bqa0_5-5-rgb_front just to show that you know hey there are different kinds of guitars and they all need different strings
1l6mc-9bqa0_6-5-rgb_front what i am holding is a classic guitar
1l6mc-9bqa0_7-5-rgb_front it needs a nylon strings
1l6mc-9bqa0_8-5-rgb_front a safe bet when you are buying strings for just about any guitar is
1l6mc-9bqa0_9-5-rgb_front they make at you know least decent strings to the best strings for whatever the guitar you are going to restring
1lcah99rqjg_0-8-rgb_front i am julie branum
1lcah99rqjg_1-8-rgb_front coming from utasana or standing forward fold take a nice deep breath in and lengthen the chest up away from the thighs
1lcah99rqjg_10-8-rgb_front make sure the weight is in the front of the heel right where the heel and the foot come together so that the quadricep is lifted a little bit with the shin and the calf action
1lcah99rqjg_11-8-rgb_front good
1lcah99rqjg_12-8-rgb_front extend and lengthen on every inhale
1lcah99rqjg_13-8-rgb_front on every exhale hugging in muscularly the legs with the quadriceps the calves and the shin muscles
1lcah99rqjg_14-8-rgb_front beautiful
1lcah99rqjg_15-8-rgb_front another deep breath in holding as you lengthen and exhale
1lcah99rqjg_16-8-rgb_front finish and fold that right hand back down to the floor
1lcah99rqjg_17-8-rgb_front great job valerie and linda
1lcah99rqjg_18-8-rgb_front wonderful
1lcah99rqjg_2-8-rgb_front good on your exhale bring your arms along side the body so hands are back by the hips and hold the posture
1lcah99rqjg_3-8-rgb_front on another inhale lift the chest up as you stand up tall swinging the arms up over head and exhale place your hands at your heart center now coming into this pose from trikanasana step the right foot back three and a half feet
1lcah99rqjg_4-8-rgb_front left toe is pointing straight forward right toes are at degree angle
1lcah99rqjg_5-8-rgb_front both legs are nice and straight
1lcah99rqjg_6-8-rgb_front take a nice deep breath in as you extend those arms out away from the shoulders
1lcah99rqjg_7-8-rgb_front exhale and lace the the left hand down on to the left shin swinging the right arm up to the sky
1lcah99rqjg_8-8-rgb_front this is a great time to use a block if needed
1lcah99rqjg_9-8-rgb_front if you feel that you have a little tightness and this is a little bit more of a lift good
1lewhtj1gi0_0-8-rgb_front a nice folkloric move is an arabic traveling to the side with the sharper hip movement
1lewhtj1gi0_1-8-rgb_front so that is going to look like this
1lewhtj1gi0_13-8-rgb_front relax your shoulders so you have a nice separate carriage keeping your body nice and in line with itself
1lewhtj1gi0_14-8-rgb_front you can use your arm up here to have a nice little line going down and priming the hip with the other hands
1lewhtj1gi0_15-8-rgb_front very good
1lewhtj1gi0_16-8-rgb_front now try this in the mirror and make sure everything is moving nicely
1lewhtj1gi0_2-8-rgb_front let is put one foot in front the other one slightly in back and we are going to pull the hip up into our rib cage really crunching your side muscles and pushing with this leg here using the ball of your foot
1lewhtj1gi0_3-8-rgb_front make sure the leg in the front stays nice and bent
1lewhtj1gi0_4-8-rgb_front so it is going to pull up like this
1lewhtj1gi0_5-8-rgb_front and we are going to travel with it so as you do it as you press up it is going to allow your other foot in the front to travel forward
1lewhtj1gi0_6-8-rgb_front so we are going to go forward forward as we lock it up
1lewhtj1gi0_7-8-rgb_front and up and in and in
1lewhtj1gi0_8-8-rgb_front other way in in in in
1lewhtj1gi0_9_10_11_12-8-rgb_front bring it in nice and sharp toward your rib cage in in good make sure you keep your belly button pulled in and your chest lifted
1lgojkzsji4_0-8-rgb_front hi i am jan kain and i am back again to tell you a little about chi gong
1lgojkzsji4_1-8-rgb_front now we are going to go into the breathing and grounding
1lgojkzsji4_10-8-rgb_front now that we are grounded in standing position we are going to talk a little bit about breathing
1lgojkzsji4_11-8-rgb_front the breathing is in through the nose and out through the nose and mouth
1lgojkzsji4_12-8-rgb_front so let is try just a couple of these
1lgojkzsji4_13-8-rgb_front inhale and exhale
1lgojkzsji4_14-8-rgb_front and again inhale and exhale
1lgojkzsji4_15-8-rgb_front just imagine your lungs are like two big balloons you want to make sure that they fill completely and empty completely
1lgojkzsji4_16-8-rgb_front you will automatically feel a great sense of calm if you breathe in this fashion
1lgojkzsji4_17-8-rgb_front so now that we know about the grounding and the breath let is move on
1lgojkzsji4_2-8-rgb_front very very important before we actually even get started
1lgojkzsji4_3-8-rgb_front there is probably the most important thing that you are going to be able to do if you are in standing position you are going to be in the neutral standing position with the feet about as wide as your hips tail bone tucked under and nice and strong
1lgojkzsji4_4-8-rgb_front spine is straight chin is tucked and you are looking straight ahead
1lgojkzsji4_5-8-rgb_front arms are right down by your sides relaxed but strong
1lgojkzsji4_6-8-rgb_front so just imagine that you have roots coming out of your feet going right into the earth
1lgojkzsji4_7-8-rgb_front it is really really important to feel centered and feel grounded and feel at one with the earth
1lgojkzsji4_8-8-rgb_front if you are in seated position you can still be grounded you can do the same thing but just imagine that you are grounding not only through your feet but up through your tail bone and right into your lower spine
1lgojkzsji4_9-8-rgb_front one of the most important things about chi gong is to realize the elements of the earth and of nature along with all the elements of your body and all the systems
1lr7mgvcz_u_0-8-rgb_front after we have hit the roots on our sections we are going to let that sit for another minutes
1lr7mgvcz_u_1-8-rgb_front now about the last minutes of your application what you are going to want to do is you are going to be breaking the color line
1lr7mgvcz_u_2-8-rgb_front so you are going to be kind of blending it
1lr7mgvcz_u_3-8-rgb_front so what you can do is go through sections maybe about a inch instead of a quarter inch take bigger sections
1lr7mgvcz_u_4-8-rgb_front gently comb it through all the way through your ends
1lr7mgvcz_u_5-8-rgb_front another one inch section taking it from the root and gently just pulling it through and combing it through your ends
1lr7mgvcz_u_6-8-rgb_front you want to remember not to irritate the scalp so just gently graze the scalp as you are bring the comb through your ends
1lr7mgvcz_u_7-8-rgb_front set it aside
1lr7mgvcz_u_8-8-rgb_front inch section comb it through and set it aside
1lr7mgvcz_u_9-8-rgb_front you are going to go through all sections doing this combing through and we would go on to our next section
1lszazosngs_0-8-rgb_front my name is jared todd
1lszazosngs_1-8-rgb_front i am going to talk a little bit about cleaning off the scale after it is been heat treated and tempered getting rid of this ugly surface scale getting it cleaned up and ready to have a handle
1lszazosngs_10-8-rgb_front it is going to be a weak spot and as you use it that spot is always going to get dull and be softer than the other
1lszazosngs_11-8-rgb_front so it is worth it to take your time and go slow
1lszazosngs_12-8-rgb_front sometimes it can be sometimes it will pit a little bit so that you have to remove some material to get it off
1lszazosngs_13-8-rgb_front it is good to just attack it a little bit with a grit belt get most of it off and then finish up with a four hundred and then go to a six hundred
1lszazosngs_14-8-rgb_front so that is what i will do now
1lszazosngs_15-8-rgb_front as you can see now we have started to remove some of the scale from the edge bevel
1lszazosngs_16-8-rgb_front this edge bevel has not been taken up all the way yet but i can remove it as long as you watch the temperature and make sure that you do not get it over two hundred and something degrees
1lszazosngs_17-8-rgb_front once you start getting in the three hundred range you start basically tempering the knife
1lszazosngs_18-8-rgb_front you start taking out the hardness
1lszazosngs_19-8-rgb_front so just take it slow
1lszazosngs_2-8-rgb_front so we will go ahead and grind a little bit on here
1lszazosngs_20-8-rgb_front it will grind differently now that it is hardened than it did when it was soft
1lszazosngs_21-8-rgb_front i will feel a little bit more slippery on the belt
1lszazosngs_22-8-rgb_front it will feel like it wants to slide around
1lszazosngs_23-8-rgb_front just make sure that you brace yourself and take it slow
1lszazosngs_3-8-rgb_front i will show you how to take it off things to look for things to be aware of
1lszazosngs_4-8-rgb_front now that this is hardened you have to be careful with how much you grind it and how hard you push on it
1lszazosngs_5-8-rgb_front because you will heat it up to a point where it will lose its hardness
1lszazosngs_6-8-rgb_front once you start getting it cleaned off and you see the shiny metal again if you are grinding on an edge and the steel color changes to a dark brown up through blues and purples it is gotten soft
1lszazosngs_7-8-rgb_front you are going to have to take it back out and you are going to have to treat it and temper it again
1lszazosngs_8_9-8-rgb_front do not think that that color is just on the surface even if you grind it off that part of the knife is still going to be soft

1lbhxfsu8du_4-8-rgb_front these books are old books that i have and i treasure them and my child or any child that would come into the house would see oh there is mommy is or daddy is one of their favorite books
1lbhxfsu8du_5-8-rgb_front the way i treated the book says a lot that i care about reading
1lbhxfsu8du_6-8-rgb_front where if i had something like this laying around or certain books that i may use for classes that is all ripped up marked what is that telling your child

1ljaz5cbwjq_0-1-rgb_front somewhere in egypt is a big river called denial and often times we are in denial because we do not really want to admit what we are doing

1ljaz5cbwjq_17-1-rgb_front but you are not dating
1ljaz5cbwjq_18-1-rgb_front by definition the definition is if you are dating you are dating some one you are not seeing many people
1ljaz5cbwjq_19-1-rgb_front so by definition be it merriam webster or anybody else is definition it means being with a single person

1lkc3y2g5do_0-8-rgb_front some of the common mistakes you may experience while learning how to ollie higher and learning how to ollie up onto different heights is probably going to have to do with the coordination that is needed with the pop and the jump
1lkc3y2g5do_1-8-rgb_front what is you are going to find is a lot of times you are going to hang up on your way up
1lkc3y2g5do_2-8-rgb_front this is very common mistake so basically what happens is when you ollie up as you are headed upward your back truck especially this part of your truck right here is going to hook up on the top of the surface and hang and cause you to get thrown forward
1lkc3y2g5do_3-8-rgb_front so what you want to do is you want to make sure that you can ollie high enough to get onto whatever you are getting onto
1lkc3y2g5do_4-8-rgb_front and after that it is just going to be trial and error
1lkc3y2g5do_5-8-rgb_front so the most common mistake is getting hooked up
1lkc3y2g5do_6-8-rgb_front the other common mistake maybe is just ollieing up too high and coming down all wrong and not being able to control your board
1lkc3y2g5do_7-8-rgb_front this is just one of the common mistakes that happens when you are trying something new or you are rolling a little too fast
1lkc3y2g5do_8-8-rgb_front so what you want to do is take it slowly at your own pace and figure these things out as you go along
1lkc3y2g5do_9-8-rgb_front and also remember that now that you are ollieing up something higher you are going to have to adjust your foot placement so further back more foot on the tip of the tail and much more jumping and figuring out how to coordinate all this stuff together and that is going to help you ollie higher
1lmkfz4ayeq_0-8-rgb_front let is learn how to do a forward and back hip slide with our shimmy
1lmkfz4ayeq_1-8-rgb_front so we are going to be layering this on top
1lmkfz4ayeq_10-8-rgb_front this is how you are going to layer it
1lmkfz4ayeq_11-8-rgb_front you are going to forward and back and forward and back
1lmkfz4ayeq_12-8-rgb_front forward and back
1lmkfz4ayeq_13-8-rgb_front be sure to keep your chest lifted
1lmkfz4ayeq_14-8-rgb_front keep your chin nice and raised
1lmkfz4ayeq_15-8-rgb_front keep your shoulders relaxed
1lmkfz4ayeq_16-8-rgb_front forward and back
1lmkfz4ayeq_17-8-rgb_front forward and back and of course depending on your music and the tempo this is something you could do a little faster too
1lmkfz4ayeq_18-8-rgb_front so it is how you want to accent your music and make your shimmy look really special doing your forward and back sliding shimmy
1lmkfz4ayeq_2-8-rgb_front so we are going to have our feet slightly apart and first of all my name is karen and this is johanna and we are with hip expressions belly dance studio in st petersburg florida
1lmkfz4ayeq_3-8-rgb_front i am going to turn to the side here because you are going to want to see how i move forward and back with this
1lmkfz4ayeq_4-8-rgb_front my hips are going to stay horizontal
1lmkfz4ayeq_5-8-rgb_front feet are slightly apart
1lmkfz4ayeq_6-8-rgb_front knees are bent
1lmkfz4ayeq_7-8-rgb_front belly button pulled in and we are going to be sliding the hips forward and back
1lmkfz4ayeq_8-8-rgb_front so we are going to be pushing them slightly forward and pulling this in and back
1lmkfz4ayeq_9-8-rgb_front now let is get our shimmy going now that you know how to do a nice strong shimmy
1lmwjvzynge_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about what bill my mechanic is doing
1lmwjvzynge_1-8-rgb_front he is changing torsion arms because last night we had a bar go bad
1lmwjvzynge_10-8-rgb_front but now he is on my left side
1lmwjvzynge_11-8-rgb_front anyways actually i could not do this without them
1lmwjvzynge_12-8-rgb_front there is no way i could be here by myself
1lmwjvzynge_13-8-rgb_front you know i have so many people supporting me
1lmwjvzynge_14-8-rgb_front you know ginns racing you know they bring the car here they keep it at their house and their shop and bill works on it and they work really really hard
1lmwjvzynge_15-8-rgb_front and they are great people to be around
1lmwjvzynge_16-8-rgb_front and they put everything towards our racing to try to get me where i need to be at in nascar some day
1lmwjvzynge_17-8-rgb_front so
1lmwjvzynge_2-8-rgb_front bars get twisted one way and you can only drive them one way so they twist with the track with the way the car is twisting
1lmwjvzynge_3-8-rgb_front and if you put them in backwards it ruins the bar and the bar goes bad and you kind of just you know it just gets saggy
1lmwjvzynge_4-8-rgb_front so he is just changing it up to make sure that it is all going to run good today
1lmwjvzynge_5-8-rgb_front you know you put the torsion bars on to get an angle on the axle
1lmwjvzynge_6-8-rgb_front in the last session it just would not stick to the track and that is you know one of the reasons that we are changing this is because a bar went bad it just you know made the whole set up just kind of went bad with the bar
1lmwjvzynge_7-8-rgb_front bill is very important to me
1lmwjvzynge_8-8-rgb_front he is my right hand man right
1lmwjvzynge_9-8-rgb_front oh yeah
1m26k_cahlq_0-8-rgb_front hello
1m26k_cahlq_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to be talking about stamp assembly
1m26k_cahlq_10-8-rgb_front i like to again match them with the block that it is going to go with
1m26k_cahlq_11-8-rgb_front that way you have an idea of where you are going to go with each stamp
1m26k_cahlq_12-8-rgb_front the thing you want to remember when you are trimming your stamps is on small stamps you do not want trim more of a inch to inch or your stamp will kind of lose its integrity
1m26k_cahlq_13-8-rgb_front it will not be able to balance good on the wood block
1m26k_cahlq_14-8-rgb_front the first thing you will need is a good pair of rubber and craft scissors
1m26k_cahlq_15-8-rgb_front what you will do is you will choose the stamp that you want to start with
1m26k_cahlq_16-8-rgb_front i am going to start with this big one here and you will get ready to cut
1m26k_cahlq_2-8-rgb_front there is types of stamps
1m26k_cahlq_3-8-rgb_front there is clear acrylic stamps there is foam stamps and there is wood block rubber stamps
1m26k_cahlq_4-8-rgb_front the one i am going to demonstrate for you today is the wooden block rubber stamps
1m26k_cahlq_5-8-rgb_front when you first get your stamps what you want to do is go ahead and pull out all your blocks and your stamps
1m26k_cahlq_6-8-rgb_front sometimes they will come with a label so go ahead and pull those out
1m26k_cahlq_7-8-rgb_front i like to set my blocks out by size
1m26k_cahlq_8-8-rgb_front that way i know how i am going to match them up with my stamps
1m26k_cahlq_9-8-rgb_front the next thing you are going to do is just take apart the stamps if they come already cut this far
1mcrysiybno_0-8-rgb_front next we want to talk about buying the coconut
1mcrysiybno_1-8-rgb_front here we have a case of coconuts
1mcrysiybno_2-8-rgb_front now these coconuts if you buy them individually at a health food store could sell for probably three to six dollars apiece which is very expensive
1mcrysiybno_3-8-rgb_front in every large town there are international world markets and you can buy these coconuts by the case
1mcrysiybno_4-8-rgb_front almost anywhere that i have talked to people in the country these cases are for sale
1mcrysiybno_5-8-rgb_front this case here goes for eleven dollars and there are nine of these coconuts in there
1mcrysiybno_6-8-rgb_front so instead of buying them individually go find your international market buy it by the case put it in your refrigerator and store them because they last a long time
1mcrysiybno_7-8-rgb_front if for some reason your coconut would get some mold or some green stuff in there just pull it out of the wrapper cut that part off and it it is ready to go
1mn7gg892wi_0-8-rgb_front hi i am jennifer cail
1mn7gg892wi_10-8-rgb_front you can use as much as you want it does take a little bit of elbow grease getting in there
1mn7gg892wi_11-8-rgb_front but you can see how well it is coming up and you also do not have like chemicals smell when you using this
1mn7gg892wi_12-8-rgb_front if you are pregnant you do not have to worry about any of the fumes so we are just going to keep applying more and more baking soda until it all comes up
1mn7gg892wi_2-8-rgb_front now that we have gotten all of our easy dirt and grease up it is time to go in for the stubborn stains using some baking soda
1mn7gg892wi_3-8-rgb_front for using the baking soda all you want to do is make a little bit of a paste so we are going to sprinkle some baking soda it is fine it is in lumps
1mn7gg892wi_4-8-rgb_front we are going to wet our sponge just a little bit and then we are going to gently pat up some you can see it is on the sponge and we are going to start scrubbing
1mn7gg892wi_5-8-rgb_front you can see it is taking this off really really well you are just going to get some more a wonderful thing about baking soda
1mn7gg892wi_6-8-rgb_front it is incredibly cheap
1mn7gg892wi_7-8-rgb_front this will be the cheapest cleaning supply that you can probably find
1mn7gg892wi_8-8-rgb_front it is also completely environmentally friendly you do not have to worry about any toxics smells you do not have to worry about your children getting into it
1mn7gg892wi_9-8-rgb_front thank goodness you use it in baked goods all the time so you can see how that is really coming up quiet nicely
1moc52dyauk_0-8-rgb_front as i said earlier if you have certain types of pages you are going to have to treat them separately
1moc52dyauk_1-8-rgb_front the most important of course is the clay coated shinny pages for books
1moc52dyauk_10-8-rgb_front so you want to go through putting wax paper between every single page now because they are clay coated these pages are going to be a lot stronger than regular book pages so you do not have to worry about them being quite as fragile while they are wet
1moc52dyauk_11-8-rgb_front once again this is for the partially wet books
1moc52dyauk_12-8-rgb_front you might need professional help if your book is completely saturated and it is the clay coated shinny pages
1moc52dyauk_2-8-rgb_front usually this is in glossy books picture books if you have an art book chances are it is going to have be clay coated
1moc52dyauk_3-8-rgb_front if this is the case it is very important for you to put wax paper in between every single page
1moc52dyauk_4-8-rgb_front if the pages are allowed to dry while they are touching they will fuse together into one mass
1moc52dyauk_5-8-rgb_front so you just take regular wax paper and you are going to put it in between pages you want to make sure that it is flat
1moc52dyauk_6-8-rgb_front now one of the problems that you are going to have once you put all of the paper in between the pages is that it is going to distort the book
1moc52dyauk_7-8-rgb_front unfortunately this can not be avoided
1moc52dyauk_8-8-rgb_front your choices are either having a distorted book with dry pages or a book in which you can not separate any of the pages because they have all dried together
1moc52dyauk_9-8-rgb_front of course if you want to use your book ever again your best option is to have slightly distorted pages in order for you to be able to read them
1mr-3abnmfo_0-8-rgb_front dr susan jewell hello
1mr-3abnmfo_10-8-rgb_front chamomile is good also
1mr-3abnmfo_11-8-rgb_front this is a tablet form but most of the time when you have a high temperature and it is associated with vomiting you probably will not like to swallow tablets so it is better to buy in these formulations in tea bags or in food additives
1mr-3abnmfo_12-8-rgb_front or you could use it to rub on to the body for like aromatherapy treatment
1mr-3abnmfo_13-8-rgb_front but as i mentioned earlier it is good to also to prevent fevers and high temperatures from fevers is to do prevention and that is also to have your daily recommended dose of vitamins and minerals
1mr-3abnmfo_14-8-rgb_front vitamin c to prevent colds and here the b complex this is too so a multivitamin
1mr-3abnmfo_15-8-rgb_front so these are some ways that you can actually help to reduce and prevent and reduce the symptoms of fever
1mr-3abnmfo_2-8-rgb_front now in this clip we are going to talk about alternative way versus the conventional way of treating fevers but that is the herbal herbal remedies
1mr-3abnmfo_3-8-rgb_front there are a lot of herbal remedies herbs out there that are readily available in your health food stores and drug stores that have properties to reduce the fever or have antipyretic properties so you can take those but before you ever take any kind of herbal remedies you should always consult with your medical doctor and get his or her advice first before you start on any of this kind of herbal therapy
1mr-3abnmfo_4-8-rgb_front now here i have some samples of some forms of herbs and also i have vitamins cause vitamins are also good to take to prevent fevers to prevent illnesses
1mr-3abnmfo_5-8-rgb_front but some of the herbs i have known for example you can get herbs that are already incorporated into drinks like in the tea bags here i have chamomile tea and even if you have fevers and you cannot ingest food or solids then tea is actually a good way to replenish your fluid intake to prevent dehydration
1mr-3abnmfo_6-8-rgb_front so here is chamomile tea that is readily available and here is a japanese tea herbal tea that you can also buy green tea
1mr-3abnmfo_7-8-rgb_front green tea is good if you can because it has a lot of in it as well
1mr-3abnmfo_8-8-rgb_front so that would also help you during the time to prevent fevers and also to treat the symptoms of fever and to prevent dehydration while you are going through a bout of high fever high temperature from the vomiting and the diarrhea
1mr-3abnmfo_9-8-rgb_front so here you have chamomile
1mtkxscyphu_1-8-rgb_front this episode we are going to be talking about sliding and diving
1mtkxscyphu_10-8-rgb_front another type of slide is a two knee slide that you see a lot more in paintball events
1mtkxscyphu_11-8-rgb_front and that is you come at a full run and you basically break down on both knees slide on both knees to the behind cover
1mtkxscyphu_12-8-rgb_front the advantage to this is with a two knee slide you can actually come up shooting and in fact you can actually get into your slide and start shooting while you are sliding
1mtkxscyphu_13-8-rgb_front it is an advantage
1mtkxscyphu_14-8-rgb_front it is something that you can use on the field
1mtkxscyphu_15-8-rgb_front which slide do you use
1mtkxscyphu_16-8-rgb_front do you use a baseball knee slide
1mtkxscyphu_17-8-rgb_front do you use a two knee slide
1mtkxscyphu_18-8-rgb_front it depends on what you are doing what bunker you are getting into and how fast you need to get from one place to another
1mtkxscyphu_2-8-rgb_front sliding and diving is very important because it is the fastest way that you can come from a full run to a full stop
1mtkxscyphu_3-8-rgb_front and also it is the best way that you can get behind some of the lower cover
1mtkxscyphu_4-8-rgb_front there is two basic kinds of slides
1mtkxscyphu_5-8-rgb_front you have the knee slide and you have the headfirst slide
1mtkxscyphu_6-8-rgb_front we are going to talk about the knee slide this time
1mtkxscyphu_7-8-rgb_front knee sliding is very much like in baseball in that when you go into your cover you are going to go in low you are going to keep one knee bent the other leg is going to be straight and you are just going to come to a complete stop on the bent knee
1mtkxscyphu_8-8-rgb_front sometimes you can also come to a complete stop on your hip as is kind of a little bit of a preference thing
1mtkxscyphu_9-8-rgb_front it also depends on how low to the ground you need to be
1mwiovyqfui_0-8-rgb_front okay before we made a sling using the double fisherman is knot
1mwiovyqfui_1-8-rgb_front this is a sling that i use
1mwiovyqfui_10-8-rgb_front you just keep going around till you get to the end
1mwiovyqfui_11-8-rgb_front then you have this loop on here that is created from the rope that we just wrapped around and pass the loop from the rope that you were wrapping and then you can tighten it up here
1mwiovyqfui_12-8-rgb_front this gives you a nice little hook or a loop to hook through with a caribbean or whatnot
1mwiovyqfui_13-8-rgb_front it is not the best to store because if you store a rope and you are going to put weight on it it is not the best idea to have because it starts to break down the fibers
1mwiovyqfui_2-8-rgb_front it is kind of a longer sling but i use this for a backing up belay device such as like an atc or traffic control or a figure eight
1mwiovyqfui_3-8-rgb_front i will show you how to use that later
1mwiovyqfui_4-8-rgb_front but anyway first thing you need to know about your sling is a way to carry it around that is useful
1mwiovyqfui_5-8-rgb_front a lot of guys will throw it over like so
1mwiovyqfui_6-8-rgb_front this kind of bothers me just because it is just something that could get stuck
1mwiovyqfui_7-8-rgb_front what i actually like to do is start at the bottom and kind of fold it in half
1mwiovyqfui_8-8-rgb_front i am going to leave enough room because we are going to wrap the other end around this
1mwiovyqfui_9-8-rgb_front and you just start wrapping like so
1m_a7gr1174_0-8-rgb_front in this clip i want to talk to you about freestyle motocross
1m_a7gr1174_1-8-rgb_front freestyle motocross really kind of putting itself on the map
1m_a7gr1174_10-8-rgb_front now you have got guys like travis pastrana doing double backflips and variations into their flips and a lot of really cool stuff coming from motocross
1m_a7gr1174_11-8-rgb_front there is kind of a different way to set up your bike for freestyling
1m_a7gr1174_12-8-rgb_front this bike or my bike is primarily motocross but a lot of guys they cut down their seats
1m_a7gr1174_13-8-rgb_front you know make their seat foams really thin because they are not you know they are not needing to do the moto
1m_a7gr1174_14-8-rgb_front they are not needing that cush in that seat to go faster on those corners and they have got a lot of big say hand holds back here and their suspension might tend to be really stiff because you know they are on average jumping about foot plus jumps
1m_a7gr1174_15-8-rgb_front so you are really going to want to you know absorb those landings and their bikes are completely set up for that
1m_a7gr1174_16-8-rgb_front maybe a little taller bars
1m_a7gr1174_17-8-rgb_front no cross pads because they are doing a lot of in and out or putting their feet up here all the time
1m_a7gr1174_18-8-rgb_front you do not want to be getting hung up on anything like that
1m_a7gr1174_19-8-rgb_front and a lot of events are really getting pretty big
1m_a7gr1174_2-8-rgb_front you know it used to be just kind of be a lot of free riding out in the hills maybe out in california beaumont artille wells a lot of places like that
1m_a7gr1174_20-8-rgb_front so that is also a cool thing is a lot of media coverage from this sport
1m_a7gr1174_21-8-rgb_front so take a look online you know there is a lot of freestyle events national and more local that are probably going to be near you
1m_a7gr1174_22-8-rgb_front come check it out and that stuff
1m_a7gr1174_23-8-rgb_front i can not personally do a lot of the tricks that they can do on there but it is real exciting to see in person
1m_a7gr1174_3-8-rgb_front guys just hitting dirt jumps
1m_a7gr1174_4-8-rgb_front now these days it is come into the stadiums into the the gravity games the mountain dew tour
1m_a7gr1174_5-8-rgb_front it is the entire series
1m_a7gr1174_6-8-rgb_front so as well as the motocross and the supercross series they also have freestyle actual series
1m_a7gr1174_7-8-rgb_front you can catch them on tv all the time
1m_a7gr1174_8-8-rgb_front i would say nate adams travis pastrana and kenny bartram these guys you know they have all just been instrumental in the motocross scene
1m_a7gr1174_9-8-rgb_front back in when carey hart flew his first backflip in new york at the gravity games that was just a huge moment for motocross

1mcmnmxg64u_26-8-rgb_front my name is robert segundo and this is your paper flower
1mcmnmxg64u_3-8-rgb_front what i am going to do is i am going to take it
1mcmnmxg64u_4-8-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and i am going to unfold it
1mcmnmxg64u_5-8-rgb_front open it all the way
1mcmnmxg64u_6-8-rgb_front now this one is kind of an odd shape
1mcmnmxg64u_7-8-rgb_front so what i am going to do is i am going to kind of fold down a little bit here at the top
1mcmnmxg64u_8-8-rgb_front this is going to be for the petals at the top
1mcmnmxg64u_9-8-rgb_front and what i like to do is fold it back up like so
1mdmz4rkrda_0-8-rgb_front i totally feel this mask tingling
1mdmz4rkrda_1-8-rgb_front it smells good it feels good this is a winner
1mdmz4rkrda_10-8-rgb_front this is when i actually do use a wash cloth to take off
1mdmz4rkrda_11-8-rgb_front immerse it
1mdmz4rkrda_12-8-rgb_front and again you can use either cold water some people like to use cold water in the morning because it gives them kind of a pick me up
1mdmz4rkrda_13-8-rgb_front i like to do my mask in the evening time so i like warm water
1mdmz4rkrda_14-8-rgb_front never hot water but warm water because it kind of gives me that comforting feel
1mdmz4rkrda_15-8-rgb_front but it is up to you to what you like
1mdmz4rkrda_16-8-rgb_front take your wash cloth gently remove circular motions
1mdmz4rkrda_17-8-rgb_front circular motions remember gentle because the wash cloth itself is a natural exfoliant for skin so it is going to help also with the mask
1mdmz4rkrda_18-8-rgb_front gentle circular sweeping motions to take the mask off
1mdmz4rkrda_19-8-rgb_front wow
1mdmz4rkrda_2-8-rgb_front i really believe j lo knows exactly what she is talking about
1mdmz4rkrda_20-8-rgb_front that feels amazing
1mdmz4rkrda_21-8-rgb_front okay
1mdmz4rkrda_22-8-rgb_front i might have to send j lo an extra baby gift because she has totally turned me on to the right things
1mdmz4rkrda_23-8-rgb_front okay so the twins are going to get something extra for this
1mdmz4rkrda_24-8-rgb_front this is good
1mdmz4rkrda_25-8-rgb_front oh my
1mdmz4rkrda_26-8-rgb_front oh
1mdmz4rkrda_27-8-rgb_front i am feeling very saucy and latino right now i am
1mdmz4rkrda_28-8-rgb_front okay
1mdmz4rkrda_29-8-rgb_front and that is how you take off the mask
1mdmz4rkrda_3-8-rgb_front this is a winner
1mdmz4rkrda_4-8-rgb_front now let is talk about taking masks off
1mdmz4rkrda_5-8-rgb_front what you want to do you will want to be extremely careful when you are taking a mask off
1mdmz4rkrda_6-8-rgb_front whether it is like this or it comes off with water or a peel off one
1mdmz4rkrda_7-8-rgb_front my best friend loves peel off ones she is like peeling stuff off all day i do not know she loves that
1mdmz4rkrda_8-8-rgb_front but whatever you are doing you want to be careful when you are taking off the mask because you do not want to irritate your skin
1mdmz4rkrda_9-8-rgb_front where normally i would take my hands and just rinse
1menlpb7ysc_1-11-rgb_front in this segment we are going to talk about how to move your arms while doing the roger rabbit
1menlpb7ysc_2-11-rgb_front now you are going to have arms by your chest and you are going to go backwards with them so your going to push back to make both of your shoulder blades touching each other you can do it from your chest or you can go lower by your waist and push in and out but backwards
1menlpb7ysc_3-11-rgb_front so your shoulder blades touch and let me say that again you are going to have your arms towards your chest pushing backwards so your shoulder blades touch now you can do these two ways which ever is comfortable for you
1menlpb7ysc_4-11-rgb_front either by your chest or a lower by your waist and make sure your shoulder blades touch back
1mida8brjni_0-11-rgb_front value can also help you provide focus and again in something like this that is set up as you know we can accept it as a realistic basic setting
1mida8brjni_1-11-rgb_front we understand that this is an indoor room because we have this back here and we can see a landscape out the back
1mida8brjni_10-11-rgb_front so we can not know what this really looked like
1mida8brjni_11-11-rgb_front but you can see that he used a limited pallet of colors we have got red and blue for sure
1mida8brjni_12-11-rgb_front we have got some sort of green blue over here
1mida8brjni_13-11-rgb_front and there is a little bit of yellow and the rest of it is sort of neutral
1mida8brjni_14-11-rgb_front but again the most the strongest contrasting color is again on the central figure where jesus is and not only that but there is a diagonal there which also kind of strengthens that
1mida8brjni_15-11-rgb_front so again we are that idea that he is important is reinforced even if we are not really aware that that is that we are being controlled that way
1mida8brjni_2-11-rgb_front so that is very handy and it gives us a sense of indoor and outdoor space
1mida8brjni_3-11-rgb_front what that also does though is that look the light of the sky is that is the lightest thing in the room just about
1mida8brjni_4-11-rgb_front in this whole picture this is very white and look it is surrounding the head of jesus the hero of the story
1mida8brjni_5-11-rgb_front so the value is the fact that this is dark this is light and then jesus has dark hair creates the value contrast that is going to create the most focus that is literally going to draw your eye there because your eye always sees the focus first
1mida8brjni_6-11-rgb_front even again if you are not aware of it your eye is doing its work and what the eye does first it goes for the place of most contrast
1mida8brjni_7_8_9-11-rgb_front and what did he do he made sure that the place of most contrast was around jesus he also managed to do this to some degree with color and again this is much harder to tell because leonardo used paint experimental way of putting paint on as a fresco technique that did not work and started falling off as soon as he finished it
1mq3cb7aa-q_0-3-rgb_front if a honey bee stings you
1mq3cb7aa-q_1-3-rgb_front you will notice that the bee leaves a little white stinger behind in your skin and then leaves and that stinger is what has the venom
1mq3cb7aa-q_2-3-rgb_front that is what makes the sting hurt and some people have a reaction to that as well
1mq3cb7aa-q_3-3-rgb_front when you see the little stinger you do not pinch it out because what you doing then is your squeezing more of the venom into your skin and it will hurt longer
1mq3cb7aa-q_4-3-rgb_front you simply scratch it out with your finger nail and you would get less venom that way
1mq3cb7aa-q_5-3-rgb_front if your allergic to bee stings you could use an epinephrine injector or something like that if your like most people not really allergic to bee stings a you get a bee sting people say well how do you treat that i have heard all kind of things
1mq3cb7aa-q_6-3-rgb_front you know you put different a ice pack or you put a piece of cucumber or whatever all kind of things you hear about to do that and what it really means to me is anything that you can keep yourself buzzy doing while the its hurting by the time you get that applied its going to stop hurting anyway
1mq3cb7aa-q_7-3-rgb_front so i do not worry to much about any of the treatment of the bee sting
1mrutikyy-c_0-11-rgb_front alright so let us start off looking over some of the materials that we will use for these basic dings you know
1mrutikyy-c_1-11-rgb_front obviously it is a step process
1mrutikyy-c_10-11-rgb_front that is what sand paper is for
1mrutikyy-c_11-11-rgb_front you got one twenty two twenty
1mrutikyy-c_12-11-rgb_front the prepping usually starts with the fifty grit which is a much more coarse sand paper
1mrutikyy-c_13-11-rgb_front you can find that at any you know home improvement store or home depot
1mrutikyy-c_14-11-rgb_front i mean all of that stuff
1mrutikyy-c_15-11-rgb_front the second you obviously you need fiberglass and resin
1mrutikyy-c_16-11-rgb_front that is over here
1mrutikyy-c_17-11-rgb_front gloves
1mrutikyy-c_18-11-rgb_front you definitely want to use gloves when it comes to using these materials
1mrutikyy-c_19-11-rgb_front what we have is this is lamination resin
1mrutikyy-c_2-11-rgb_front what you want to do first is you want to prep and fill the ding
1mrutikyy-c_20-11-rgb_front you could get that at any kind of plastic store
1mrutikyy-c_21-11-rgb_front surf shops actually carry most of this ding repair stuff nowadays
1mrutikyy-c_22-11-rgb_front after the lam resin there is hot coat resin
1mrutikyy-c_23-11-rgb_front which is surfacing agent resin which is sanding resin
1mrutikyy-c_24-11-rgb_front and all that that is is laminating resin with a surfacing agent in it that you add
1mrutikyy-c_25-11-rgb_front but obviously you could buy it as a hot coat
1mrutikyy-c_26-11-rgb_front brushes to apply the resin you know
1mrutikyy-c_27-11-rgb_front we got squeegees to squeegee out the resin after you saturate it
1mrutikyy-c_28-11-rgb_front and then obviously you need acetone to clean your tools and yourself
1mrutikyy-c_29-11-rgb_front we have got fiberglass which is obviously really important
1mrutikyy-c_3-11-rgb_front and for that what we will use is just any kind of normal you know mat knife that you could get from home depot
1mrutikyy-c_30-11-rgb_front this is a four ounce fiber glass
1mrutikyy-c_31-11-rgb_front and what you do is you know you use the resin to apply the fiberglass and get it to bond to the surf board
1mrutikyy-c_32-11-rgb_front and then this is what is called q cell or micro balloons
1mrutikyy-c_33-11-rgb_front and what it is it is just a finely chopped fiber glass
1mrutikyy-c_34-11-rgb_front and it what i call it is a surf board bondo you know what i mean
1mrutikyy-c_35-11-rgb_front and that is what you are going to do
1mrutikyy-c_36-11-rgb_front you are going to mix it laminating resin and you are going to fill that in
1mrutikyy-c_37-11-rgb_front and it is just going to take up the space that was taken away from the surf board
1mrutikyy-c_38-11-rgb_front all ding repairs the fiber glass that you put on is actually on top of the surface
1mrutikyy-c_39-11-rgb_front once you get it back to its normal state that is when you do your structural damage you know
1mrutikyy-c_4-11-rgb_front any straight edge you know even a razor blade will work in some of these instances
1mrutikyy-c_40-11-rgb_front and apply those products
1mrutikyy-c_41-11-rgb_front from our tools and materials let us get into the real safety part of this process
1mrutikyy-c_5-11-rgb_front you definitely want sand paper
1mrutikyy-c_6-11-rgb_front golden rule about surfboard repair resin will not bond to anything that is not prepped which means it has to be coarse and sanded
1mrutikyy-c_7-11-rgb_front so if you think you can just pour the resin in the hole and it will bond it will not
1mrutikyy-c_8-11-rgb_front at least sand it first
1mrutikyy-c_9-11-rgb_front resin will bond to it
1mwoiglrhck_0-11-rgb_front these little punches are great when you are doing paper cutting designs
1mwoiglrhck_1-11-rgb_front i am going to use these little symbols to decorate my flags and add a little burst of color we will do a little bit of yellow for each one
1mwoiglrhck_10-11-rgb_front nice and even and smooth and your design is finished
1mwoiglrhck_11-11-rgb_front and we have a beautiful colorful traditional style puppet theater
1mwoiglrhck_2-11-rgb_front and i will just put a little bit of punched symbol in each of our flags
1mwoiglrhck_3-11-rgb_front you just put the glue a little more glue and place you are punched out design there
1mwoiglrhck_4-11-rgb_front so all our little symbols also add to the theater feel of our our place with butterflies and a cupid for love and flowers for beauty
1mwoiglrhck_5-11-rgb_front we have the moon here and you need some horses for the knights and a little teddy bear a star and a heart
1mwoiglrhck_6-11-rgb_front and to finish off our design i i have cut out some letters i have cut out the word puppet is just free hand
1mwoiglrhck_7-11-rgb_front i am going to start with any lettering you want to start on the middle letter to make sure you have an even placement
1mwoiglrhck_8-11-rgb_front and i have cut the letters free hand so there just a little fun and jumbled looking
1mwoiglrhck_9-11-rgb_front and instead of cutting out the dots of the letters i used a star in the middle o k and when you are finished laying out all your letters and your little punch shapes you want to make sure you glaze over the design with decoupage glue
1naiestkr0q_0-11-rgb_front welcome back
1naiestkr0q_1-11-rgb_front we are here to tell you today what you should wear and other items that you need to have when you work out on the elliptical trainer
1naiestkr0q_10-11-rgb_front that is what you need to do today is you need to really let this go and let it sweat
1naiestkr0q_11-11-rgb_front sweat it out
1naiestkr0q_12-11-rgb_front this is what it is about working your heart and so having a towel is a must
1naiestkr0q_13-11-rgb_front you will need that to feel good and to keep the gym clean of course too but you also will need water
1naiestkr0q_14-11-rgb_front you are going to replenish that sweat so you have to drink and you will be able to really feel the recovery then when you have the water and you hydrate yourself so that is why it is most important to go ahead and have these items for that safety reasons
1naiestkr0q_15-11-rgb_front the other thing that you really need to have i think is so important is a proper type of music
1naiestkr0q_16-11-rgb_front some gyms play their own music which can work very nicely for yourself if you like that type of music but you can personalize it by just bringing your own headphones and having the only type of music that you like and the rhythms and the things that you like to listen to which will help you to move more freely and enjoy your experience on the elliptical trainer so thank you and we will be right back
1naiestkr0q_2_3_4-11-rgb_front the first thing that you really need to have is something that is loose comfortable fitting nothing that is binding you do not want your knees to get caught
1naiestkr0q_5-11-rgb_front you want to feel very comfortable in what you are wearing
1naiestkr0q_6-11-rgb_front comfortable shoes is a must
1naiestkr0q_7-11-rgb_front something that you can tie and that would not slip off very easily
1naiestkr0q_8-11-rgb_front something to have a little room just as if you are running and when you are working on the cardio machine your feet can swell slightly so it is best to have very comfortable fitting shoes is a very important thing because the grips on the shoes would be on the pedals and you want to feel safe and be able to really feel free to move on the machine so if you have very good comfortable shoes it is really important
1naiestkr0q_9-11-rgb_front you will also need a towel because you are going to sweat
1ngl_zl6zvw_0-11-rgb_front let is talk now about how to change the hook on a lure
1ngl_zl6zvw_1-11-rgb_front most of your lures especially ice fishing jigs have a metal ring at the end of them and that is how the hook goes on
1ngl_zl6zvw_10-11-rgb_front the treble hook as you can see is going to be pushing the single hook that i want to take off and i am just going to continue that until the single hook comes off and now i have got my treble on my lure
1ngl_zl6zvw_2-11-rgb_front lures always come with a hook but sometimes it is not the hook you want
1ngl_zl6zvw_3-11-rgb_front for example some most come with a treble hook but in some states using a treble hook with bait while ice fishing is illegal so with those you would always want to change them out
1ngl_zl6zvw_4-11-rgb_front in other states there are not regulations like that but you might still want to change them for other reasons
1ngl_zl6zvw_5-11-rgb_front so i have got a single hook on this lure right now
1ngl_zl6zvw_6-11-rgb_front what i am going to do is i am going to change it to a treble hook
1ngl_zl6zvw_7-11-rgb_front i am just going to put my nail my thumbnail into that ring bend it apart and now i am going to start the hook that i want to take off backwards
1ngl_zl6zvw_8-11-rgb_front so that is going there
1ngl_zl6zvw_9-11-rgb_front while i do that i am going to insert the treble hook at the same time and then simply just wind everything back to me
1nn1dqws0q4_0-11-rgb_front another way to emphasize what addition really means is to reverse it
1nn1dqws0q4_1-11-rgb_front you tell your child a story that has an addition problem in it and then they have to figure out what the problem is and then solve it
1nn1dqws0q4_10-11-rgb_front you had lollipops and they can draw the lollipops if they need to but this time they might not need to plus equals how many
1nn1dqws0q4_11-11-rgb_front now if they have to draw dots or even in this case you could draw lollipops that is fine
1nn1dqws0q4_12-11-rgb_front
1nn1dqws0q4_13-11-rgb_front they count with their pencil point and then they write the answer and you say good job
1nn1dqws0q4_14-11-rgb_front then tell them another number story
1nn1dqws0q4_15-11-rgb_front i had teddy bears and somebody gave me more how many teddy bears did i have at the end of the day
1nn1dqws0q4_16-11-rgb_front and they write it in
1nn1dqws0q4_17-11-rgb_front drawing teddy bears would be tedious tell them to make a circle for each teddy bear or a dot
1nn1dqws0q4_18-11-rgb_front and there you have another very simple worksheet that you can do again and again to emphasize and build their skill of learning addition
1nn1dqws0q4_2-11-rgb_front so i could say you had friends over today those friends plus yourself make how many children all together
1nn1dqws0q4_3-11-rgb_front now write that down in a problem and i would start out when you make a worksheet like this give them a box plus another box equals the answer
1nn1dqws0q4_4-11-rgb_front and you can make the answer a box i make a line just to show it is a different type of number
1nn1dqws0q4_5-11-rgb_front for that last story you plus friends it would be
1nn1dqws0q4_6-11-rgb_front you can of course the stories are unlimited
1nn1dqws0q4_7-11-rgb_front you can say you have lollipops and your friend gave you more so how many did you have all together
1nn1dqws0q4_8-11-rgb_front before you answer that write the problem in here
1nn1dqws0q4_9-11-rgb_front so how many remember this is the first number you started out with
1nx2joehvmq_0-11-rgb_front now i want to show you how to portray the intended dynamic that you have for the piece using the preparation beat
1nx2joehvmq_1-11-rgb_front so using the preparation beat if a piece starts loud we are going to give it a big upbeat
1nx2joehvmq_10-11-rgb_front it is a small upbeat
1nx2joehvmq_11-11-rgb_front one two three four
1nx2joehvmq_12-11-rgb_front one two three four
1nx2joehvmq_13-11-rgb_front let is try that sometimes it helps to raise your plane up
1nx2joehvmq_14-11-rgb_front one two three four
1nx2joehvmq_15-11-rgb_front if you noticed my movements are smaller too
1nx2joehvmq_16-11-rgb_front one two three four
1nx2joehvmq_2-11-rgb_front if it starts softer piano we are going to give it a smaller upbeat
1nx2joehvmq_3-11-rgb_front sometimes we want to bring our plane higher too if it is soft
1nx2joehvmq_4-11-rgb_front so lets do a forte a loud entrance
1nx2joehvmq_5-11-rgb_front one two three four
1nx2joehvmq_6-11-rgb_front it is a big grand upbeat
1nx2joehvmq_7-11-rgb_front let is try that again
1nx2joehvmq_8-11-rgb_front one two three four
1nx2joehvmq_9-11-rgb_front now let is do a piano entrance a soft entrance
1naxxinojbu_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we will actually be ear candling
1naxxinojbu_1-8-rgb_front so you have got your tray and you have got your candle and you need some flames
1naxxinojbu_10-8-rgb_front and if any ashes end up falling they will land right into the tray
1naxxinojbu_11-8-rgb_front the candles themselves do not have much wax
1naxxinojbu_12-8-rgb_front they are gauze like i mentioned sort of dipped in wax and then made in this hollow shape so there is no wax from the candle dripping down on you
1naxxinojbu_13-8-rgb_front the suction that the fire creates through the candle is drawing the wax out of your ear
1naxxinojbu_14-8-rgb_front it is good to do this once maybe twice a year
1naxxinojbu_15-8-rgb_front and at the season change is the best time especially from winter to spring
1naxxinojbu_16-8-rgb_front now once the candle has burned down to the point of a couple of inches from your tray and you can use your handy mirror looks like i am there
1naxxinojbu_17-8-rgb_front this is where your bowl of water comes in handy
1naxxinojbu_18-8-rgb_front you simply remove the candle from your ear being careful and remove it from the tray and then drop the end in the water
1naxxinojbu_19-8-rgb_front and if you are a curious fellow you could cut the end of the candle and take a look at what came out of your ear
1naxxinojbu_2-8-rgb_front you light the end of your candle
1naxxinojbu_3-8-rgb_front and you see that the candle actually is hollow
1naxxinojbu_4-8-rgb_front what this creates it creates a full seal like a draw from the flame through the hollow tube of the candle
1naxxinojbu_5-8-rgb_front and it creates a suctioning effect from the end of the candle which you will insert into your ear gently but firmly creating a seal
1naxxinojbu_6-8-rgb_front now if smoke starts to appear down here i know i do not have a good seal
1naxxinojbu_7-8-rgb_front and so if you are alone hopefully you have a friend but if you are alone have your mirror handy so you can watch and see what is going on
1naxxinojbu_8-8-rgb_front you want the candle to be as vertical as possible
1naxxinojbu_9-8-rgb_front and you will notice the tray is here the tin foil tray to protect my head
1nnhzvwbe44_1-11-rgb_front the position we want to talk about last is the goal keeper
1nnhzvwbe44_2-11-rgb_front not because they are the least important but because they are very important
1nnhzvwbe44_3-11-rgb_front a goal keeper is the one person who is allowed to use their hands
1nnhzvwbe44_4-11-rgb_front they own the that we talked about anywhere inside that on the defensive end of the field the goal keeper is allowed to get that ball
1nnhzvwbe44_5-11-rgb_front you have to make sure that you control the ball it is a person that has to dive and make saves and has to probably get a little dirtier than everybody else as well
1nnhzvwbe44_6-11-rgb_front making sure that you are making sure that that ball never gets into the back of that net that is your job
1nnhzvwbe44_7-11-rgb_front your job is awesome because you can see the field you kind of need to be the field general telling your defense where to be seeing the different players and where they need to put the ball making sure you move your players into right position
1nnhzvwbe44_8-11-rgb_front when you get the ball and you receive the ball and control it you are able to throw the ball out to your offensive and defensive players you are also able to punt the ball out to other people making sure that you are keeping the ball in control and controlling the game back there as you are a goal keeper
1oasat1qcwc_1-3-rgb_front so we are ready to add the beef as we can see the beef keeps cooking in the bowl and that is why we leave it at medium rare at the first place
1oasat1qcwc_2-3-rgb_front be sure the juice coming out from the beef we want to get them inside the wok because we want to keep the vegetables dry and not from the oil and the grease is off the beef
1oasat1qcwc_3-3-rgb_front then we can start stir frying them again you know the beef should be cooked relatively quickly so do not hesitate
1oasat1qcwc_4-3-rgb_front as you cans see the dish right now is almost down it is about time to add the sauce to thicken the dish
1ojm9p-j4pc_1-11-rgb_front if your shoes your leather shoes happen to be fitting a little bit tighter you can use a shoe stretcher
1ojm9p-j4pc_2-11-rgb_front you put it in the inside of your shoe and your spray it in the inside of your shoe where it is fitting tight
1ojm9p-j4pc_3-11-rgb_front as soon as you put it on make sure to wear them for a very long time to where your feet would mold into them
1ojm9p-j4pc_4-11-rgb_front pretty much it would stretch out when you wear it when you put this on there
1ojm9p-j4pc_5-11-rgb_front these are leather protectors
1ojm9p-j4pc_6-11-rgb_front you use these right as soon as you get your shoes home
1ojm9p-j4pc_7-11-rgb_front you want to spray this on so that it will help your shoes from getting water stains dust dirt or some kind of grease stains on your fabric
1ojm9p-j4pc_8-11-rgb_front it is good for leather new shoes and fabric shoes
1ojm9p-j4pc_9-11-rgb_front you just spray all throughout the whole shoe top to bottom and it will repeal water stains and other stains that you may get
1on5gdoco44_0-8-rgb_front here are three procedures to have a dust rag ready at all times
1on5gdoco44_1-8-rgb_front first of all
1on5gdoco44_10-8-rgb_front just spray the inside of the bag
1on5gdoco44_11-8-rgb_front put your rag inside
1on5gdoco44_12-8-rgb_front close it and it is ready at all times with the oil ready to pickup the dust
1on5gdoco44_13-8-rgb_front believe it or not dryer sheets fragranced at that
1on5gdoco44_14-8-rgb_front you have them
1on5gdoco44_15-8-rgb_front you can dust and you can smell the fragrant and they pick up the dust
1on5gdoco44_2-8-rgb_front take a clean jar
1on5gdoco44_3-8-rgb_front spray it with your favorite dusting oil
1on5gdoco44_4-8-rgb_front put a clean lint free rag inside of the jar
1on5gdoco44_5-8-rgb_front close it
1on5gdoco44_6-8-rgb_front leave it overnight
1on5gdoco44_7-8-rgb_front the rag will absorb the oils and you will have a dusting rag ready at all times
1on5gdoco44_8-8-rgb_front plus it is safe because it is keeping the oils enclosed inside the jar
1on5gdoco44_9-8-rgb_front you can do the same thing with a plastic bag
1otrvr_y0lw_0-8-rgb_front here is another fish attracting technique
1otrvr_y0lw_1-8-rgb_front it is called chumming a hole
1otrvr_y0lw_10-8-rgb_front to spend a little bit of money on that to catch some fish is going to be well worth it
1otrvr_y0lw_2-8-rgb_front not something you always think about while fishing but it can be a highly effective technique
1otrvr_y0lw_3-8-rgb_front now always make sure to check the fishing regulations with your state is fish and wildlife agency to make sure that this is legal before doing it
1otrvr_y0lw_4-8-rgb_front essentially all you are doing is putting bait down a hole to attract fish
1otrvr_y0lw_5-8-rgb_front the scent the smell the taste of this bait is going to bring these fish in
1otrvr_y0lw_6-8-rgb_front so you can do anything from chopping up shiners and putting pieces down a hole that is really a good technique for lake trout to taking maggots putting them down a hole
1otrvr_y0lw_7-8-rgb_front and again you know put down six seven eight a half dozen a dozen see what happens
1otrvr_y0lw_8-8-rgb_front see if you can get those fish to come in
1otrvr_y0lw_9-8-rgb_front you can also do the same thing you can cut up night crawlers into very small pieces again put those down the hole
1oupuxtsify_1-8-rgb_front now i am going to show you how a terracotta sculpture is made a small piece but i will show you
1oupuxtsify_10-8-rgb_front we can make it into a human being by putting it a nice head or have just a suggestive shape which will give it some kind of identity
1oupuxtsify_11-8-rgb_front this is before fire when in the fire is sand rust and brick so if we keep it in the solo shape the heat is distributed much better so that the heat does not affect
1oupuxtsify_12-8-rgb_front well this is very interesting we are doing things so i hope you have enjoyed this
1oupuxtsify_13-8-rgb_front thank you
1oupuxtsify_2-8-rgb_front you take the dough and you bat it bat it flat with anything with a brush or a handle or whatever and then you roll the clay and cut out the edges
1oupuxtsify_3-8-rgb_front you take a knife and cut the edges cut the edges so that you get a nice long six inch scale or eight inch scale depending on what
1oupuxtsify_4-8-rgb_front then you bend it like this so you have seen that we have made two bands together and we have shaped a cylindrical shape like this
1oupuxtsify_5-8-rgb_front now we are going to repeat this process and as we go further we keep repeating this process and putting the second glort similar band that we have made and we are going to put it on the first band by scratching the surface of the edge off the first one little bit of water with a brush and then we put the second band
1oupuxtsify_6-8-rgb_front now we keep repeating this process of making these bands and fitting it on top of one another until it goes up and up and up until we have come to a point where we feel that the basic foundation for what we are trying to make is complete
1oupuxtsify_7-8-rgb_front you will notice which is turning out to be hollow it is a hollow cylindrical shape
1oupuxtsify_8-8-rgb_front for terracotta sculptures it has to be hollow
1oupuxtsify_9-8-rgb_front you know it is almost like an abstract shape as you see it but later on you can turn it into a completely abstract shape keep it as an abstract sculpture or we can place any kind of recognizable object
1oxgjipw3h8_0-11-rgb_front how do i use boric acid to kill fleas
1oxgjipw3h8_1-11-rgb_front boric acid is generally sold at hardware stores usually it will be labeled as a flea killer
1oxgjipw3h8_10-11-rgb_front now the boric acid is relatively harmless
1oxgjipw3h8_11-11-rgb_front no one i have ever heard of ever having any problems with it hurting their animals or anything but as always be careful when using anything like this
1oxgjipw3h8_12-11-rgb_front you never know what the effects it might have
1oxgjipw3h8_13-11-rgb_front and there you have it as simple as that
1oxgjipw3h8_14-11-rgb_front we have used boric acid to treat our carpet for fleas
1oxgjipw3h8_2-11-rgb_front it will come in like a shaker kind of container much like this or really any other flea powder
1oxgjipw3h8_3-11-rgb_front you also achieve the same thing that boric acid does by mixing borax four parts of borax to one part salt using it in the same way you would use boric acid
1oxgjipw3h8_4-11-rgb_front and boric acid essentially your just going to take in this little shaker and this is used on carpeting and you will take and you will just sprinkle it over carpeting o k
1oxgjipw3h8_5-11-rgb_front and you will kind of mash that in
1oxgjipw3h8_6-11-rgb_front you want it to get as deep in to the carpet as possible o k
1oxgjipw3h8_7-11-rgb_front and then you are going to let it sit for a day
1oxgjipw3h8_8-11-rgb_front and what that does is dessicate any adult fleas and eggs and stopping them from growing or killing adults stopping them from laying eggs any further
1oxgjipw3h8_9-11-rgb_front after that day is up you are going to have to vacuum the boric acid back up
1olafiqq10a_0-8-rgb_front there is no question it takes four legs to make a usable horse
1olafiqq10a_1-8-rgb_front so we are going to look at the front legs and learn some of those parts because that is what in any kind of horse work you are going to need to know how to talk and converse with your veterinarian in a professional way as horses do become lame and it is important to understand those parts
1olafiqq10a_10-8-rgb_front this is the unnecessary part that has through evolution come up and created this bony or horny kind of spot
1olafiqq10a_11-8-rgb_front a lot of people do not understand that this is just a piece of that bone tissue that was like the hoof
1olafiqq10a_12-8-rgb_front then we have down here another part similar
1olafiqq10a_13-8-rgb_front this horse does not have much of it but there is a small part that you may feel when you palpate around the horse is leg
1olafiqq10a_14-8-rgb_front and that is called an ergot
1olafiqq10a_15-8-rgb_front the ergot is similar to the chestnut
1olafiqq10a_16-8-rgb_front it is just a piece of hoof tissue that can be peeled away and kept in a neat and tidy appearance when we clip these horses for show
1olafiqq10a_2-8-rgb_front we have a forearm just like we would have on our bodies
1olafiqq10a_3-8-rgb_front we consider this part of the horse to be the knee
1olafiqq10a_4-8-rgb_front as well as then we have the cannon bone
1olafiqq10a_5-8-rgb_front the cannon bone is a strong structural part that is supported by tendons and ligaments
1olafiqq10a_6-8-rgb_front and that leads down into the pastern
1olafiqq10a_7-8-rgb_front the pastern has a fetlock joint this joint here and the portion between the fetlock and the coronary band where the hoof grows from
1olafiqq10a_8-8-rgb_front we want to know that this is called a chestnut
1olafiqq10a_9-8-rgb_front and that is actually a part of the evolution of the horse is front leg at a time when the horse was a animal
1ovwfk_k3-q_0-8-rgb_front so that application is out and now you are thinking classes
1ovwfk_k3-q_1-8-rgb_front where do i take classes
1ovwfk_k3-q_10-8-rgb_front when you are thinking about a great school call you have seen that guy whatever his name is or gal and she is all over the signs like me shelly davis you know everywhere you turn you see shelly davis team shelly davis pick up the phone and call shelly davis and say where did you go to school what worked for you
1ovwfk_k3-q_11-8-rgb_front there is always going to be a real estate school that has a stellar reputation amongst the realtors and there is a reason why
1ovwfk_k3-q_2-8-rgb_front there is a barrage of places that you can take real estate classes
1ovwfk_k3-q_3-8-rgb_front you can take them on line you can take them at your local community college or you can take them at a local real estate school
1ovwfk_k3-q_4-8-rgb_front you might live in a small town and you are thinking real estate school
1ovwfk_k3-q_5-8-rgb_front where is the closest one
1ovwfk_k3-q_6-8-rgb_front well it might be minutes away
1ovwfk_k3-q_7-8-rgb_front well let me tell you now and this is based on my experience
1ovwfk_k3-q_8-8-rgb_front there is thousands of realtors in the world
1ovwfk_k3-q_9-8-rgb_front they all have their own experience and i feel that i am one of the best out there though because of my research in finding a good school and that kind of thing so let me tell you how to do it
1oys0kyrss0_0-8-rgb_front now previously we talked about finding the release point
1oys0kyrss0_1-8-rgb_front as we stated the release point is essentially the point where the ball comes out of his hand
1oys0kyrss0_10-8-rgb_front you get to see what kind of pitch is coming
1oys0kyrss0_11-8-rgb_front other then what kind of pitch is coming what else are you looking for
1oys0kyrss0_12-8-rgb_front you are looking for is it up is it down is it inside is it outside all these different things
1oys0kyrss0_13-8-rgb_front is it way in the dirt there is no need to swing is it a ball is it a strike
1oys0kyrss0_14-8-rgb_front you know is the umpire giving him that much room
1oys0kyrss0_15-8-rgb_front these are all things you can see just from following the ball
1oys0kyrss0_16-8-rgb_front yes you need to make a split second decision but that split second decision becomes a lot easier if you are watching the ball come at you instead of saying here ok you are looking at home plate thinking about something else
1oys0kyrss0_17-8-rgb_front be looking down at the pitcher follow the ball all the way in
1oys0kyrss0_18-8-rgb_front so from his release point which is here out of his hand you want to follow it track it track it track it all the way through contact
1oys0kyrss0_19-8-rgb_front and that is staying on the ball
1oys0kyrss0_2-8-rgb_front whether it is here it is here it is here it is somewhere in this vicinity
1oys0kyrss0_3-8-rgb_front now once it leaves his hand you need to keep your eyes on the ball
1oys0kyrss0_4-8-rgb_front this is why in our stance we have a level head we have both eyes pointed down at the pitcher makes it much easier to pick up
1oys0kyrss0_5-8-rgb_front why do you want to follow the ball out of his hand
1oys0kyrss0_6-8-rgb_front a if you do not see the ball you can not hit the ball
1oys0kyrss0_7-8-rgb_front i can sit here all day with him throwing balls at me if my eyes closed i am not going to hit a single one
1oys0kyrss0_8-8-rgb_front but if i can see the ball i have a much better chance of making contact
1oys0kyrss0_9-8-rgb_front what is the other thing that you get to see
1p2ratktcxy_0-11-rgb_front and today were going to plant the parsley seed and i would like to take a brief time to talk about the kind of seed that you might be purchasing here were today were planting the italian flat leaf parsley which has the flat leafs on it and there is also a curly leaf parsley which is very curly and i personally prefer the curly leaf
1p2ratktcxy_1-11-rgb_front it grows in nice close bunches
1p2ratktcxy_2-11-rgb_front but the flat leaf is also good to
1p2ratktcxy_3-11-rgb_front you want to make sure that you order these seed early in the year january of february you can go the internet and look up great organic catalog companies and chose the kind of seed you want to have and the interesting thing about parsley is that is very very good for you
1p2ratktcxy_4-11-rgb_front it is probably one of the highest plants next to asparagus that creates an alkalizing effect in your body and that is based on your ph its very similar to people that want to make sure that they want make sure to a proper ph in their pools
1p2ratktcxy_5-11-rgb_front we also want to make sure that the proper ph is in our system
1p2yqu9kwnw_0-8-rgb_front what is an essential oil and what is the difference between an essential oil and a perfume
1p2yqu9kwnw_1-8-rgb_front so we have some essential oils here these are plant derivatives
1p2yqu9kwnw_2-8-rgb_front and basically you can get them in various processes
1p2yqu9kwnw_3-8-rgb_front some people will get what is called a distiller and they take the raw plant material and they put it into the distiller with some water and it squishes out the plant essentials
1p2yqu9kwnw_4-8-rgb_front the other thing we have here is we have perfumes and perfumes are actually kind of similar
1p2yqu9kwnw_5-8-rgb_front basically they are a mixture of essential oils that have alcohol or some other kinds of preservatives added to them
1p2yqu9kwnw_6-8-rgb_front and perfumes can also be made synthetically so this could actually be you know a perfume could actually be something that is entirely man made
1p2yqu9kwnw_7-8-rgb_front it does not actually have to come from a plant
1p2yqu9kwnw_8-8-rgb_front but essential oils which are these are actually basically something they squish out of the plant
1p2yqu9kwnw_9-8-rgb_front and when you use these you can use them for aroma therapy
1pbxucxjkx8_1-8-rgb_front this is bailey and he is an eight year old quarter horse
1pbxucxjkx8_10-8-rgb_front if you look at his back it is very short on top his underline is very long underneath that makes for a strong back and he can really get with it and run and stretch out because of how long he is underneath
1pbxucxjkx8_11-8-rgb_front we will go around to the back of bailey and take a look at his back end
1pbxucxjkx8_12-8-rgb_front one of his other faults he does fidget a little laughing
1pbxucxjkx8_13-8-rgb_front but if you look at his back end i want you to notice how if you look at his hip and how it flows to his tail he has a really nice low tail set
1pbxucxjkx8_14-8-rgb_front and what that usually goes along with is a really long line down his buttocks down this way into his hock
1pbxucxjkx8_15-8-rgb_front i i like a really long line to there
1pbxucxjkx8_16-8-rgb_front which means his hocks are going to be set very close to the ground
1pbxucxjkx8_17-8-rgb_front what that does is it allows him to power out of his turns it makes it much easier for him to get down and in the ground and to be able to push out of a turn
1pbxucxjkx8_18-8-rgb_front if he were to have a flatter behind up here and a tail set higher it is more like a shelf
1pbxucxjkx8_19-8-rgb_front those kind of horses usually have a harder time getting down in the ground for there turns
1pbxucxjkx8_2-8-rgb_front he does not by any means have perfect confirmation but he has a lot of things that i do look for in a barrel horse
1pbxucxjkx8_20-8-rgb_front they have a tendency to to not be able to really gather before they start to run toward the next barrel which we will talk about in our lessons in a few moments
1pbxucxjkx8_21-8-rgb_front so those are the things that bailey has that are very very good
1pbxucxjkx8_22-8-rgb_front his faults we are going to overcome because one thing that bailey has that goes with what i look for in a barrel horse is an excellent disposition
1pbxucxjkx8_23-8-rgb_front he is very fidgety which a lot of barrel horses are they have to have an a fire to have a desire to run
1pbxucxjkx8_24-8-rgb_front what he does have though that is very good is he is extremely focused
1pbxucxjkx8_25-8-rgb_front when he gets in the arena he is very focused on his job and horses that are great barrel horses really love to do it
1pbxucxjkx8_26-8-rgb_front if you come by a horse that is is not enjoying their job they are not going to be very good at it
1pbxucxjkx8_27-8-rgb_front so that is really the number one thing i look for in a barrel horse beyond confirmation is they have to have the desire to do this job
1pbxucxjkx8_28-8-rgb_front you can tell that pretty soon after you start to work them
1pbxucxjkx8_29-8-rgb_front so bailey is an excellent prospect i have some that are better conformed but like i said his disposition and attitude and and his desire to do this job really fills in for some of his faults
1pbxucxjkx8_3-8-rgb_front he is my current barrel horse that i am currently competing on
1pbxucxjkx8_4-8-rgb_front the biggest thing that is his detriment is when looking at this horse he has a very long head
1pbxucxjkx8_5-8-rgb_front however as we will talk about there are some conformational faults that i will overlook if the horse is a performer
1pbxucxjkx8_6-8-rgb_front this horse is one that i raised and did not sell because of his long head and it turned out very good for me because he is been an excellent barrel horse
1pbxucxjkx8_7-8-rgb_front if you look at bailey is neck it is rather short and you will notice that standing here his head is rather high also a fault but one that i can use some different equipment to kind of overcome and so you will see that when we get to the equipment portion
1pbxucxjkx8_8-8-rgb_front what i do with a horse that has a confirmation fault like that to kind of make up for that in a way
1pbxucxjkx8_9-8-rgb_front what he does have that is excellent is he has nice nice sloping shoulder he has very short cannon bones which is the area from the knee to the ankle he has really a nice slope to his pastern
1pdmmsywdja_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is sue conrad and i am going to show you how to exercise in your car
1pdmmsywdja_1-8-rgb_front you may think it sounds kind of silly to do exercises in your car but we spend a lot of time in our car and this will help reduce some of the tension and stress that we spend driving around town
1pdmmsywdja_10-8-rgb_front so you are going to tense those inner thigh muscles and you are going to release
1pdmmsywdja_11-8-rgb_front another exercise you can do in your vehicle to help loosen up the shins are toe raises
1pdmmsywdja_12-8-rgb_front you can bring your toes forward hold for ten seconds and then relax
1pdmmsywdja_13-8-rgb_front bring your toes forward raising the heels holding for ten seconds and then release
1pdmmsywdja_14-8-rgb_front and that is how you can exercise in your car
1pdmmsywdja_2-8-rgb_front the first exercise we are going to do is a shoulder shrug
1pdmmsywdja_3-8-rgb_front you want to take your shoulders and bring them up towards your ears you are going to hold two or three seconds then you are going to relax
1pdmmsywdja_4-8-rgb_front so basically you are tensing up your shoulders and then you are releasing all the stress coming out of your shoulders
1pdmmsywdja_5-8-rgb_front i would suggest doing this eight to ten times holding for two to three seconds and if you feel like you want to do some more you can do another set or two
1pdmmsywdja_6-8-rgb_front another exercise you can do to keep your tush from getting numb is to tense your gluteal muscles hold for ten seconds and then release
1pdmmsywdja_7-8-rgb_front so you are going to tense release tense and release
1pdmmsywdja_8-8-rgb_front another exercise you can do is to help strengthen the inner thighs
1pdmmsywdja_9-8-rgb_front you can either take a small pillow a towel or a sweatshirt whatever you have in your vehicle put in between your thighs and you can squeeze your inner thighs and then relax
1phuppnh9oe_0-11-rgb_front alright we are going to continue to cut up onions until they are nice and small and then we are going to go ahead and make our sauce for the steak
1phuppnh9oe_1-11-rgb_front that is going to make the sauce a little bit ahead of time so we give it a chance to cool down before we spoon it over the top of our steak and mushrooms
1phuppnh9oe_2-11-rgb_front alright those onions look pretty good so we are just going to move them off to the side
1phuppnh9oe_3-11-rgb_front we are going to take a small mixing bowl and we are going to go ahead and put a tablespoon of dijon mustard
1phuppnh9oe_4-11-rgb_front you can do this with country mustard horseradish mustard depending on how much you like spice
1phuppnh9oe_5-11-rgb_front we are going to rinse this off and we are going to add some horseradish
1phuppnh9oe_6-11-rgb_front now we have got horseradish cream here
1phuppnh9oe_7-11-rgb_front you can use pure horseradish or you can even go and grate horseradish depending on how spicy you would like it to be
1phuppnh9oe_8-11-rgb_front add about a teaspoon of black pepper and half a teaspoon of salt and then we will just mix it up together
1ppakrfqnhg_0-8-rgb_front now we are ready to cut
1ppakrfqnhg_1-8-rgb_front before we cut let me explain what i am using here
1ppakrfqnhg_10-8-rgb_front so again it is just basic it is no need to be afraid of the tool just to be aware of what is going on and stay focused on what you are doing
1ppakrfqnhg_11-8-rgb_front a lot of people at home may not have this tool and that is fine there is other hand saws and circular saws or whatever that you could by for cheaper but because i am working in my shop i am going to use the quick and easy chop saw
1ppakrfqnhg_12-8-rgb_front so what i have done is for one of my dimensions created a line so it is nice to know where you are going
1ppakrfqnhg_13-8-rgb_front one of the things to remember when cutting with the line is there is a situation that occurs when you are cutting wood and i will demonstrate it
1ppakrfqnhg_14-8-rgb_front if you notice there the saw blade the thickness of the saw blade is cut into the wood
1ppakrfqnhg_15-8-rgb_front we call it a curf it is not important what you call it really but the thing of it is we have to remember that this dimension is being lost this amount of wood is being lost in our cut
1ppakrfqnhg_16-8-rgb_front so if we want like in our apron piece inches to that line that means we have to make sure the blade is on the opposite of what we started our measurement
1ppakrfqnhg_17-8-rgb_front that is kind of an important thing
1ppakrfqnhg_18-8-rgb_front a lot of people do not realize that until it could be common sense i do not know but that is kind of an important part of the process
1ppakrfqnhg_19-8-rgb_front so we want to make sure that we cut on the opposite along the line but on the opposite side clear as mud
1ppakrfqnhg_2-8-rgb_front i am using a chop saw it is called the chop saw because it cuts in a chopping fashion
1ppakrfqnhg_20-8-rgb_front now once you line it up i like to bring the blade down with my hand off the trigger which is in the handle here
1ppakrfqnhg_21-8-rgb_front line my piece up and like i said just on the other side of the line
1ppakrfqnhg_22-8-rgb_front once i am lined up i hold it in my place
1ppakrfqnhg_23-8-rgb_front hold it in place my hand safe distance from the blade
1ppakrfqnhg_24-8-rgb_front easy as pie
1ppakrfqnhg_25-8-rgb_front now we will do that to the other four pieces
1ppakrfqnhg_26-8-rgb_front we also want to make sure that we cut our table leg down and just for repetitions so you guys remember it we are going to do the same process again
1ppakrfqnhg_27-8-rgb_front right on the line hold it place bring it down
1ppakrfqnhg_28-8-rgb_front easy as pie
1ppakrfqnhg_29-8-rgb_front once our pieces are cut we are ready to assemble
1ppakrfqnhg_3-8-rgb_front the trigger is up in the handle
1ppakrfqnhg_4-8-rgb_front the nice thing about this saw is that the guard keeps the blade covered at all times
1ppakrfqnhg_5-8-rgb_front you also want to make sure definitely you are wearing your eye protection during this process
1ppakrfqnhg_6-8-rgb_front you also want to make sure that when you are using it you line your piece up keeping it tight against the fence and holding it with one hand
1ppakrfqnhg_7-8-rgb_front now where you hold it and how you hold it you have to be very careful of as well
1ppakrfqnhg_8-8-rgb_front just watch where your fingers are you do not want to take anything off
1ppakrfqnhg_9-8-rgb_front make sure your hand is away from the blade as you bring it down
1ps3oghyuaa_0-8-rgb_front now that you have selected your tea cup i am going to show you how to prep it so we are able to make a nice little design in here
1ps3oghyuaa_1-8-rgb_front first of all we are going to remove the cup and this is called cling
1ps3oghyuaa_10-8-rgb_front next you tape the container you just use your clear florist tape and just make a little x on the container
1ps3oghyuaa_11_12-8-rgb_front o k and that is how you prep the container
1ps3oghyuaa_2-8-rgb_front it is a very very sticky tape and what this will do is secure your tea cup to the plate
1ps3oghyuaa_3-8-rgb_front you just rip off a little piece and you can pull it out and just kind of go around the little the circle on the plate and then you take your tea cup and stick it to the plate
1ps3oghyuaa_4-8-rgb_front and you do not want any of it to show so there we go
1ps3oghyuaa_5-8-rgb_front so that is how your get this to stick
1ps3oghyuaa_6-8-rgb_front next we are going to take a piece of floral foam now the floral foam i have had soaking it is best to let this soak overnight because you do not want it to have pockets of air in here
1ps3oghyuaa_7-8-rgb_front so if it soaks overnight it is going to be very moist you want it to be saturated fully
1ps3oghyuaa_8-8-rgb_front and what i am going to do is cut a piece to fit in this container
1ps3oghyuaa_9-8-rgb_front so i am just going to cut a little piece and we are going to just cut it down a little bit more and a little bit more just going to kind of wing it here then you push it in to the container
1pwvfhd-nwc_1-8-rgb_front this segment would be a background in buddhism
1pwvfhd-nwc_2-8-rgb_front buddhism starts with the birth of siddhartha gautama who became the buddha he was born in b c
1pwvfhd-nwc_3-8-rgb_front to a privilege family
1pwvfhd-nwc_4-8-rgb_front his shelter existences created the culture which he eventually left and sot refugee in the jungle for years becoming sync
1pwvfhd-nwc_5-8-rgb_front realizing that there we a middle way did not have to be so extreme and in this middle way he from this then from the rest of his life
1pwvfhd-nwc_6-8-rgb_front for over years he thought other basic principles and we would talk a little bit about them in the following segments

1pd6cdncuem_0-11-rgb_front let is talk about how to get rid of cat odor
1pd6cdncuem_1-11-rgb_front cat odor comes from two sources one urine odor and two fecal odor
1pd6cdncuem_2-11-rgb_front litter boxes are very important to keep clean
1pd6cdncuem_3-11-rgb_front there are many types of litter that are on the market some work better than others some cats rely on better than others
1pd6cdncuem_4-11-rgb_front some cats do not like certain types of litter so always experiment initially to find out what your cat prefers
1pd6cdncuem_5-11-rgb_front there are also many products on the market to help with urine odors urine staining and things like that
1pd6cdncuem_6-11-rgb_front also some cats that are long haired may retain a little bit of urine or fecal material on their fur so keeping their fur under their tail trimmed or clean baby wipes work very well for instance can help urine and fecal odor
1pnicdqfroa_0-8-rgb_front hi
1pnicdqfroa_2-8-rgb_front if you focus on the air speed the green arc is the maneuvering speed of the airplane
1pnicdqfroa_3-8-rgb_front when you get into the yellow arc that is the caution area
1pnicdqfroa_4-8-rgb_front that is the point where complete deflection of the controls at high speed could damage the airplane
1pnicdqfroa_5-8-rgb_front in the green arc full deflection of controls is not supposed to damage the airplane
1pnicdqfroa_6-8-rgb_front so in the yellow arc you have to be careful in the green arc you have a normal flying mode and when you get to the red line that is a do not exceed speed
1pnicdqfroa_7-8-rgb_front that is the point where if you exceed the red line in this case miles an hour then the wings may come off the airplane which is not a good situation
1pnicdqfroa_8-8-rgb_front we never fly above red line not in the airplane
1ptbp5xtidw_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to loosen up our knees for our martial arts workout
1ptbp5xtidw_1-8-rgb_front so what we are going to do is simply put both hands on our knees
1ptbp5xtidw_10-8-rgb_front five in one direction five in the other and repeat that
1ptbp5xtidw_11-8-rgb_front now if you feel any strain any pressure in the knee you must be very very careful and get that checked out because any kind of damage down there can get bad in a hurry
1ptbp5xtidw_12-8-rgb_front so get that checked
1ptbp5xtidw_13-8-rgb_front rotate those knees get them warmed up and you are ready to go
1ptbp5xtidw_2-8-rgb_front we are going to rotate our knees in one direction
1ptbp5xtidw_3-8-rgb_front again one way and the other way
1ptbp5xtidw_4-8-rgb_front now as i rotate i am bending my knees bringing them forward as much as i can all the way to one side bringing them back again
1ptbp5xtidw_5-8-rgb_front so now my knees are straight and now i bend again as i come to the other side
1ptbp5xtidw_6-8-rgb_front knee injuries are extremely common in many martial arts
1ptbp5xtidw_7-8-rgb_front there is a lot of pivoting involved
1ptbp5xtidw_8-8-rgb_front so it is essential that we loosen up this area warm it up get blood flowing into that area where the knees are so we get a safer workout
1ptbp5xtidw_9-8-rgb_front so from here again hands on the knees nice and easy rotate one way all the way around
1ptcpcwbvbc_0-8-rgb_front alright now we are going to take our large pot turn our heat up to eight and we are going to pour out a tablespoon of oil and also going to measure out a tablespoon of butter
1ptcpcwbvbc_1-8-rgb_front now we are going to move this around the bottom of the pan until it covers all the bottom then we are going to measure out a half a cup of white rice
1ptcpcwbvbc_2-8-rgb_front whenever you are measuring something like this it can have a tendency to spill so it is best to pour it out over into what you plan to put it in that way there is no waste
1ptcpcwbvbc_3-8-rgb_front alright we are going to give this a stir to let the butter incorporate with the rice and we are going to go back to our vegetable stock and stir this
1ptcpcwbvbc_4-8-rgb_front i can see the little globs down here at the bottom
1ptcpcwbvbc_5-8-rgb_front alright then we are going to measure out one cup of stock because you would like to have a two to one liquid to rice ratio
1ptcpcwbvbc_6-8-rgb_front move the stock and then we are going to bring this to our back burner we are going to bring this up to a boil
1ptcpcwbvbc_7-8-rgb_front then when it does so we are going to take our lid and put it on and reduce the heat
1pycas4xl9u_0-11-rgb_front tip number collecting jewelry over time
1pycas4xl9u_1-11-rgb_front instead of going out on one grand buying trip as much fun as that may be it is a better and more accurate reflection of your personality if you slowly collect key pieces of jewelry over time
1pycas4xl9u_10-11-rgb_front if you like costume jewelry and you want to just buy a big bunch of it all at once it is very easy to do this within a limited budget at either an antiques fair or a knock off place or a discount store like target or mervyns
1pycas4xl9u_11-11-rgb_front both of these places have really cute costume jewelry and you can go spend a lot of money all lot at once and completely change your jewelry wardrobe
1pycas4xl9u_2-11-rgb_front for example do a single initial buying trip and find out what you need
1pycas4xl9u_3-11-rgb_front then after that continue to buy pieces when you go shopping in the future
1pycas4xl9u_4-11-rgb_front for example if someone gives you a gift certificate for your birthday this is a great opportunity to buy that ring that you have been eying for the past couple months
1pycas4xl9u_5-11-rgb_front it is also a great way to fill in holes in your jewelry wardrobe without a great outlay of money all at one time
1pycas4xl9u_6-11-rgb_front most people is budget cannot afford to spend an enormous amount of money all at one time on jewelry or anything else

1pycas4xl9u_8-11-rgb_front even your whole lifetime
1pycas4xl9u_9-11-rgb_front the exception to this rule is costume jewelry

1qbxhsvmups_0-8-rgb_front hi this is aaron at fitness for life in wilmington north carolina here to help give you a little guidance on how fast to walk on a treadmill
1qbxhsvmups_1-8-rgb_front number if we feel like it is too much then it probably is
1qbxhsvmups_10-8-rgb_front be endurant but continue mixing up your walking schedule
1qbxhsvmups_11-8-rgb_front if you have got a goal and you want to get up to a higher walking pace push yourself come back and recover a little bit try to get up to that mark the closer you work towards it the more you will be able to get there but overall if you do not know how fast to walk and you feel like you are walking too fast or you are a little cautious there is probably good reason
1qbxhsvmups_12-8-rgb_front be safe walk inside your comfort zone but push the limits when you can and that is the word from fitness for life
1qbxhsvmups_2-8-rgb_front you have got to know your body
1qbxhsvmups_3-8-rgb_front we remind a lot of people here even in our gym do not over push yourself you are going to end up over training at the very worst you will create an injury so if you are on a treadmill and you kind of feel like you are pushing the limits a little too much most likely you are
1qbxhsvmups_4-8-rgb_front back off into a level that you feel a little more comfortable with because this and i can not give a number because that number is going to vary for all different types of people
1qbxhsvmups_5-8-rgb_front know your limits
1qbxhsvmups_6-8-rgb_front challenge yourself
1qbxhsvmups_7-8-rgb_front keep a track of what your paces have been
1qbxhsvmups_8-8-rgb_front if you are walking at miles an hour but you can not really do track that
1qbxhsvmups_9-8-rgb_front if you continue to walk at that level it will not take too long before you can get up to that level
1qmph_7fl68_0-8-rgb_front now there is a few other things that you do not want to use email for no matter how badly you want to do it
1qmph_7fl68_1-8-rgb_front one never ever deliver tragic email
1qmph_7fl68_10-8-rgb_front but an email is totally different kind of communication all we have to determine tone feeling thoughts all of that are words
1qmph_7fl68_11-8-rgb_front so if you write to me i am so angry because you did that well i can not hear your tone of voice to determine how angry
1qmph_7fl68_12-8-rgb_front i can not see your facial expression to determine what your face is doing what your body is doing
1qmph_7fl68_13-8-rgb_front so a person could take it in way too many different ways
1qmph_7fl68_14-8-rgb_front they could blow it off or they could get into hysterics when they are really not in trouble at all
1qmph_7fl68_15-8-rgb_front and it is kind of a it is something that people who really like to avoid confrontation really love disciplining via email
1qmph_7fl68_16-8-rgb_front so you do not want to do that
1qmph_7fl68_17-8-rgb_front also in this tie together a little bit you never want to write emails when you are angry
1qmph_7fl68_18-8-rgb_front because when you are angry you know in the present state your thoughts you are angry your body says you are angry your voice says you are angry
1qmph_7fl68_19-8-rgb_front so you are going to sit down and you are going to fire off an email that will come across very very hostile
1qmph_7fl68_2-8-rgb_front it is very very impersonal
1qmph_7fl68_20-8-rgb_front always cool down before you send an email when you are angry
1qmph_7fl68_21-8-rgb_front because you got to remember once you hit that send button it cannot be retrieve it cannot be retread
1qmph_7fl68_22-8-rgb_front so whatever you say on those fits of anger it is there it is gone
1qmph_7fl68_23-8-rgb_front the damage has been done
1qmph_7fl68_3-8-rgb_front you do not want to fire somebody you do not want to let them know one of their died
1qmph_7fl68_4-8-rgb_front it totally makes it impersonal
1qmph_7fl68_5-8-rgb_front it shows disrespect for human being is feelings
1qmph_7fl68_6-8-rgb_front so you want to avoid that
1qmph_7fl68_7-8-rgb_front you also never want to discipline an employee or another person via email
1qmph_7fl68_8-8-rgb_front why
1qmph_7fl68_9-8-rgb_front again it makes it very impersonal
1qnsermkiiu_0-3-rgb_front not only as a female but also as a hair stylist there is nothing i hate more personally than hearing my precious tool hit the ground
1qnsermkiiu_1-3-rgb_front i am laura gibson beauty expert and i am here today to talk to you about curling irons not only curling irons but your battery operated curling iron
1qnsermkiiu_10-3-rgb_front open and then curl it let it go and voila that is all there is to it
1qnsermkiiu_11-3-rgb_front i am laura gibson beauty expert and take care of your tools
1qnsermkiiu_2-3-rgb_front it is like any other curling iron
1qnsermkiiu_3-3-rgb_front you have your shell your rod but no cord
1qnsermkiiu_4-3-rgb_front that is the best part about it
1qnsermkiiu_5-3-rgb_front you can take it almost anywhere
1qnsermkiiu_6-3-rgb_front you can take it camping europe different outlets
1qnsermkiiu_7-3-rgb_front even better less space in your bag when you go to travel
1qnsermkiiu_8-3-rgb_front the way the economy is now that is an extra twenty five dollars for that little space
1qnsermkiiu_9-3-rgb_front use it just like any other curling iron
1qqez4pbqkm_0-11-rgb_front amanda claire so one of the very basic things you might want to do with the toy let is say you like the sounds it makes already and you do not necessarily want to bend it yet maybe one of the first things you want to do is just put an audio jack in it so you can run it through your amplifier or your stereo or whatever it is
1qqez4pbqkm_1-11-rgb_front so that is what i have got here
1qqez4pbqkm_10-11-rgb_front so now we have basically taken the sound that is going to that speaker and we have extended it into this jack
1qqez4pbqkm_11-11-rgb_front so i have done this with alligator clips
1qqez4pbqkm_12-11-rgb_front so what does that mean
1qqez4pbqkm_13-11-rgb_front that means if we remember what we have done we can do it with wires we can drill a hole in the case and install that jack permanently and just have very very short little wires that go from the speaker to the jack and then the jack is installed in the case and then you just forget about it then you do not need the alligator clips at all and then you have installed a jack and then you can use it that way with your amplifier
1qqez4pbqkm_2-11-rgb_front i have actually already kinda stuck it on the cable
1qqez4pbqkm_3-11-rgb_front all right there is our audio jack and this is a live cable
1qqez4pbqkm_4-11-rgb_front this is going into a guitar amplifier over there so we just kinda put it on there
1qqez4pbqkm_5-11-rgb_front and now what i have got here you look at the speaker here there are two terminals
1qqez4pbqkm_6-11-rgb_front every speaker has two sometimes three little contacts on it that go to these wires that are going to the circuit board
1qqez4pbqkm_7-11-rgb_front well what you can do is you can take your alligator clips and just clip it on those two terminals on the speaker and then you can take the other side of those clips and clip it on to the terminals of your jack here
1qqez4pbqkm_8-11-rgb_front and then once you have done that then we can press a button and it is coming to the amplifier now
1qqez4pbqkm_9-11-rgb_front we do not have the amplifier very loud but it is all right
1qyhdb1ewqc_0-8-rgb_front we just talked about ear points to quit smoking
1qyhdb1ewqc_1-8-rgb_front and there is also body point to help quit smoking
1qyhdb1ewqc_10-8-rgb_front so if we use the needles going upward to the lung direction and then we thread needle underneath the skin and if we can go point three point five inches we can stimulate two points
1qyhdb1ewqc_11-8-rgb_front one is tim mee point the other is lung
1qyhdb1ewqc_12-8-rgb_front and the good thing about this point is we can leave the needles here for even a couple of hours if the patient is comfortable
1qyhdb1ewqc_13-8-rgb_front so we can tape there and leave it there to continue stimulate the point because this is on a lung channel so that help the lung function
1qyhdb1ewqc_2-8-rgb_front one of the most important body point to quit smoking is on the hand and it is called a tim mee point
1qyhdb1ewqc_3-8-rgb_front how we can locate this tim mee point
1qyhdb1ewqc_4-8-rgb_front so this is the hand
1qyhdb1ewqc_5-8-rgb_front the tim mee point is between this on a transverse line there is a point called a large intestine
1qyhdb1ewqc_6-8-rgb_front so when you move your finger like this and between these two tendons that is one point
1qyhdb1ewqc_7-8-rgb_front and then inch above this transverse line is called lung
1qyhdb1ewqc_8-8-rgb_front those two points in the middle it is the tim mee point
1qyhdb1ewqc_9-8-rgb_front this tim mee point we can use that to quit smoking
1qksnbhvjly_0-8-rgb_front okay so one of the things you want to work on is the coming in and out of the front door that is typically where the dog are loose in the house when you are not home

1r9bua9jwsy_0-11-rgb_front okay so now you want to make sure that you have cleaned this stick off because you want to put it back into your carrier
1r9bua9jwsy_1-11-rgb_front so you put it into your bowl of water that is got disinfectant in it and get your cloth because if you just if you just wash it if you just do this inside the water it is not going to really get everything off
1r9bua9jwsy_2-11-rgb_front you want to wipe it down
1r9bua9jwsy_3-11-rgb_front you want to you want to actually you know rub off any kind of germs that is on there in the disinfectant water
1r9bua9jwsy_4-11-rgb_front just give it a good good rub okay
1r9bua9jwsy_5-11-rgb_front and that is good to go
1r9bua9jwsy_6-11-rgb_front so just shake it off a little bit and then i will just put that straight into the carrier
1r9bua9jwsy_7-11-rgb_front couple drops of water will dry couple drops of water will dry in a within a few minutes
1r9bua9jwsy_8-11-rgb_front that is absolutely fine
1r9bua9jwsy_9-11-rgb_front so you have got your stick ready to go the next time you want to clean a bathroom
1rgiqgux360_0-8-rgb_front the marine organism we are going to identify now is the yellowhead jawfish
1rgiqgux360_1-8-rgb_front the next time you are hanging out under your dive boat in a sandy or rubble area look around closely you may see a small burrow dwelling fish it is the yellowhead jawfish
1rgiqgux360_10-8-rgb_front their heads are slightly darker and range in color from a pale yellow to a pale tan
1rgiqgux360_11-8-rgb_front their fins generally are fairly clear and pearlescent in appearance
1rgiqgux360_12-8-rgb_front they range in size from two to four inches with most in the two to three inch range
1rgiqgux360_13-8-rgb_front their depth range is from ten to sixty feet and they are most commonly seen in sandy areas near coral reefs
1rgiqgux360_14-8-rgb_front i have generally seen them in small communities of five to ten animals in a relatively small reef area
1rgiqgux360_15-8-rgb_front while hovering over their burrow yellowhead jawfish are constantly feeding
1rgiqgux360_16-8-rgb_front their diet consists almost entirely of zooplankton that drifts by their burrows
1rgiqgux360_17-8-rgb_front they will occasionally eat small jellyfish and hydroids that also happen to drift by
1rgiqgux360_18-8-rgb_front the small communities of yellowhead jawfish that i mentioned earlier serves a useful purpose during the breeding season which is usually late winter or early spring
1rgiqgux360_19-8-rgb_front since the fish rarely wonder far from its burrow it is convenient to have females and males located near one another
1rgiqgux360_2-8-rgb_front they are very interesting fish to watch
1rgiqgux360_20-8-rgb_front when they mate the male courts the female by swimming in an arched position with its fins pointed toward the female
1rgiqgux360_21-8-rgb_front after fertilization the male incubates the eggs in his mouth until they hatch
1rgiqgux360_22-8-rgb_front the male with eggs will have his mouth slightly open and one will be able to see the eggs which start out clear and then darken as the fry develop in them
1rgiqgux360_23-8-rgb_front the male also turns the eggs to aerate them regularly
1rgiqgux360_24-8-rgb_front that is the yellowhead jawfish
1rgiqgux360_3-8-rgb_front after building a burrow in the rubble or sand the yellowhead jawfish will be seen hovering tail down just above the burrow opening
1rgiqgux360_4-8-rgb_front when it feels threatened the fish quickly backs down into its burrow so only its head protrudes
1rgiqgux360_5-8-rgb_front if it feels an even greater threat the yellowhead jawfish will retreat quickly all the way into its burrow and out of sight
1rgiqgux360_6-8-rgb_front some will reemerge fairly quickly while others will wait quite a few minutes to ensure that whatever threat was there is gone
1rgiqgux360_7-8-rgb_front they can be seen with regularity in all parts of the tropical waters of florida the bahamas and the caribbean
1rgiqgux360_8-8-rgb_front yellowhead jawfish are also very pretty fish
1rgiqgux360_9-8-rgb_front their bodies are white to a pearlescent bluish white
1rr7qtefd-4_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to talk about cooking the macrobiotic way
1rr7qtefd-4_2-8-rgb_front okay we also have our that we have soaked overnight and they are ready to go into the pot
1rr7qtefd-4_3-8-rgb_front this is a pressure cooker we are going to cook the beans in the pressure cooker we are going to put a piece of kombu and we are going to let the beans come to a boil and remove any extra foam
1rr7qtefd-4_4-8-rgb_front part of the reason we soak is to get rid of the foam but we are also going to remove any foam
1rr7qtefd-4_5-8-rgb_front once we are sure that there is no foam we are going to close the pressure cooker and we are going to let the beans cook in the pressure cooker until soft it takes about minutes
1rr7qtefd-4_6-8-rgb_front okay
1rr7qtefd-4_7-8-rgb_front and they are going to cook and when we finish cooking we are going to have our finish product which is our cooked
1rt2mdvamqu_0-8-rgb_front the biggest thing that people say when they have a busy schedule is that they just can not get their exercise in
1rt2mdvamqu_1-8-rgb_front i am going to give you a few tips on how you might be able to incorporate some exercises to your diet into your day
1rt2mdvamqu_10-8-rgb_front remember you can always go on the internet and order many of these simple devices that you can add throughout your day that way you do not have to spend time going shopping cause we know you are busy
1rt2mdvamqu_2-8-rgb_front one thing you can do is you can get one of these balls and if you sit at a desk you can switch out your chair for about an hour and balance on this ball and that helps build your core
1rt2mdvamqu_3-8-rgb_front another thing you can do is you can get on the internet and buys some of these handy little devices this is a band that you can get some strength training from and use it with your arms and your legs
1rt2mdvamqu_4-8-rgb_front then also this is just a dumbbell that you can stop by any sporting good store and pick some up
1rt2mdvamqu_5-8-rgb_front a lot of people say they just do not have time to make it to the gym and that is okay so start parking far away from school far away from your work not really far but you can go ahead and park maybe an extra ten minutes
1rt2mdvamqu_6-8-rgb_front then you can walk and you will be getting ten minutes of exercise to work to or to school and ten minutes to walk back
1rt2mdvamqu_7-8-rgb_front think about at the grocery store to or even at the gym
1rt2mdvamqu_8-8-rgb_front if you are going to the gym do not try to find the first parking spot and fight the person for the parking spot
1rt2mdvamqu_9-8-rgb_front simply park in the back of the parking lot and then you will get maybe five minutes of exercise walking to where ever it might be where you might go
1rc77bay7jg_0-8-rgb_front sometimes i am asked to design logos
1rc77bay7jg_1-8-rgb_front certain calligraphers are really great at designing logos
1rc77bay7jg_10-8-rgb_front this is actually a clever reference to that
1rc77bay7jg_11-8-rgb_front black white and gray
1rc77bay7jg_12-8-rgb_front can you see the black white and gray in this
1rc77bay7jg_13-8-rgb_front alright so let me show you a few other logos that i have done
1rc77bay7jg_14-8-rgb_front there is a an absolutely magnificent patisseire chocolatere gelatere in mt
1rc77bay7jg_15-8-rgb_front kisco new york and it is called la tulipe desserts and i designed their logo
1rc77bay7jg_16-8-rgb_front and it is just an absolutely enchanting place to visit with absolutely delicious pastries and so on
1rc77bay7jg_17-8-rgb_front and a logo like this alright winds up going on all kinds of things
1rc77bay7jg_18-8-rgb_front so designing a logo has certain requirements and one of them is that it is a design that needs to go up and it needs to go down
1rc77bay7jg_19-8-rgb_front and it needs to get battered by different kinds of media that might be taking it on
1rc77bay7jg_2-8-rgb_front may i mention one of my mentors raphael boguslav
1rc77bay7jg_20-8-rgb_front this is an example of an advertisement that i did for them when i first started
1rc77bay7jg_21-8-rgb_front and you see here is the logo
1rc77bay7jg_3-8-rgb_front you can check out his work just by going to the internet
1rc77bay7jg_4-8-rgb_front i can not really say that i have had a zillion jobs doing logos so i can not really say that i specialize in it
1rc77bay7jg_5-8-rgb_front i find that as a calligrapher there are certain types of businesses that a hand done logo works for
1rc77bay7jg_6-8-rgb_front obviously obviously i am going to do my own logo
1rc77bay7jg_7-8-rgb_front and so i would call you know this is a trade card design
1rc77bay7jg_8-8-rgb_front it winds up to be a little tiny thing like this of course
1rc77bay7jg_9-8-rgb_front i wonder if you remember in the beginning when i showed you that fancy p from the book of kells
1retf-iczlq_0-8-rgb_front and now we are going to talk about it has an auto focus assist lamp
1retf-iczlq_1-8-rgb_front and this is an infrared lamp that lights up the area and allows the auto focus to work properly
1retf-iczlq_10-8-rgb_front now the digital zoom it will basically crop it in the camera and reduce the area of your photograph to a smaller area which will make it look like its zoomed and magnified
1retf-iczlq_2-8-rgb_front and you can basically turn that on or off
1retf-iczlq_3-8-rgb_front you probably want to keep it on
1retf-iczlq_4-8-rgb_front and you have also got automatic focus and automatic exposure locks
1retf-iczlq_5-8-rgb_front so if you set something up like a flower and then you want it to be the same exposure level when a bee flies in because the bee may change the exposure and the focus you might want to lock all that down so that it will be done properly as that bee comes across the screen and you are ready to shoot
1retf-iczlq_6-8-rgb_front you have also got digital zoom
1retf-iczlq_7-8-rgb_front now two kinds of zooms
1retf-iczlq_8-8-rgb_front there is digital zoom and optical zoom
1retf-iczlq_9-8-rgb_front optical is locking in a lot better because you are able to into to something optically and make it larger with the same amount of pixels
1rlbyion5ia_0-8-rgb_front coming next into cow face pose
1rlbyion5ia_1-8-rgb_front so let is start with our legs
1rlbyion5ia_2-8-rgb_front we are going to take our legs crossing one over the other
1rlbyion5ia_3-8-rgb_front we are going to attempt to bring the knees on top of each other
1rlbyion5ia_4-8-rgb_front so the knees should be stack or as close to it as possible
1rlbyion5ia_5-8-rgb_front and we want to keep these ankles flexed to create a nice solid foundation for the knee so the knee does not get torque in the wrong direction
1rlbyion5ia_6-8-rgb_front so from here let is take our left right leg is on the top so let is take our left arm reaching it behind the head and taking the right arm sweeping it underneath and reaching for our fingertips clasping the fingertips getting a nice stretch for the arms and releasing the fingertips and untwining
1rlbyion5ia_7-8-rgb_front relax
1ronmbxogde_0-8-rgb_front the next merengue partnering basic steps that everyone has to has to master
1ronmbxogde_1-8-rgb_front begin in close position
1ronmbxogde_10-8-rgb_front i am not just connected on the back
1ronmbxogde_11-8-rgb_front i have a point of connection on the back but i also have a point of connection right here where my arm is touching the side of her body
1ronmbxogde_12-8-rgb_front so if i want her to move to the side i am using my arm to bring her side
1ronmbxogde_13-8-rgb_front i am also opening up this arm a little wider than i normally would and with that she is stepping right with me right on time
1ronmbxogde_14-8-rgb_front now to switch it is a little tricky because we are staying on the same rhythm we are going left right left right left right and then to switch to front back it is the same thing i may use my left hand a little bit more to lead it and coming back i am using about fifty fifty
1ronmbxogde_15-8-rgb_front my right and my left
1ronmbxogde_16-8-rgb_front again it is just using your frame having a good connection
1ronmbxogde_17-8-rgb_front those are the major major parts in these types of basic merengue steps
1ronmbxogde_2-8-rgb_front could be an open position but it is much better lead from this close position
1ronmbxogde_3-8-rgb_front now what we are going to do is go into our merengue and i am going to take my partner actually instead of in a circle i am going to take her side side and forward back
1ronmbxogde_4-8-rgb_front so we are going to come we are going to start the step and one two three four five six seven and one two three four five six seven and one two three four five six seven and one two three four five six seven and one two three four five six seven and one more basic three four five six seven eight
1ronmbxogde_5-8-rgb_front again in general the leader is using his frame
1ronmbxogde_6-8-rgb_front the leader is traveling and he is taking his dance partner with him
1ronmbxogde_7-8-rgb_front he is using his whole body and i am not just using my hand and not just trying to make her go places by pushing her around
1ronmbxogde_8-8-rgb_front i am actually using my arm
1ronmbxogde_9-8-rgb_front any part that is connected

1rs4i373i7w_0-8-rgb_front hi
1rs4i373i7w_10-8-rgb_front are you really willing to give up certain items like dining in or buying the latest dvd movie
1rs4i373i7w_11-8-rgb_front it might more realistic to cut back on the amount you spend rather to attempt totally removing these kinds of expenses from your budget plan
1rs4i373i7w_12-8-rgb_front you can reduce the amount you spend in these items rather than trying to totally eliminate these luxuries
1rs4i373i7w_13-8-rgb_front it is often said if you fail to plan you plan to fail
1rs4i373i7w_14-8-rgb_front a written budget will not only help you keep on track but will also help you to evaluate where your budget needs to be revised
1rs4i373i7w_15-8-rgb_front start a written plan for each month
1rs4i373i7w_16-8-rgb_front know that budgets are fluid
1rs4i373i7w_17-8-rgb_front at the end of months evaluate how well your budget worked or what adjustments are needed
1rs4i373i7w_18-8-rgb_front some items get forgotten and are not placed in your budget
1rs4i373i7w_19-8-rgb_front for example gifts for birthdays graduations weddings showers
1rs4i373i7w_2-8-rgb_front there are many reasons why a budget might fail or why people give up on their budget but drawing up a budget is usually pure drudgery and livened only by the reality of staring your foolish spending habits in your face
1rs4i373i7w_20-8-rgb_front these are some of the big items that do not make the budget list but which will also throw budgeting into chaos
1rs4i373i7w_21-8-rgb_front other forgotten items include car insurance professional association or club dues subscription and internet fees and other kinds of expenses which show up only periodically or annually
1rs4i373i7w_22-8-rgb_front the solution to this problem is to pull out the calendar and list what kinds of special occasions will be coming up in the next to months
1rs4i373i7w_23-8-rgb_front set a price range for gift purchases rather than shopping impulsively
1rs4i373i7w_24-8-rgb_front annual costs such as dues subscription fees and car insurance and divide them out by
1rs4i373i7w_25-8-rgb_front keep a running tally of all annual costs and check periodically as costs go up or down for each item
1rs4i373i7w_3-8-rgb_front in fact one of the chief impediments of budgeting is that most people would rather not know how they really use the money
1rs4i373i7w_4-8-rgb_front take heart any spending mistakes you are making are probably common and not impossible to kick
1rs4i373i7w_5-8-rgb_front more over the bulk of budgeting paints happen at the beginning
1rs4i373i7w_6-8-rgb_front after you have a budget in place and you have fine tuned it with a couple of months of actual spending tracking your expenditures become almost automatic
1rs4i373i7w_7-8-rgb_front a lot of people have unrealistic projections
1rs4i373i7w_8-8-rgb_front if you are determined to make a budget work then you have got to be realistic
1rs4i373i7w_9-8-rgb_front you have got to be honest with yourself is the first step
1rtprulchqk_0-8-rgb_front last but not least we did not talk about getting into a tiebreaker situation
1rtprulchqk_1-8-rgb_front in intermediate tennis it is probably going to pop up at some point
1rtprulchqk_10-8-rgb_front if you win the toss or if it is your turn to serve you are serving one time
1rtprulchqk_11-8-rgb_front you are getting two balls but you are serving from the deuce court
1rtprulchqk_12-8-rgb_front whoever wins that point then you go to the next serve which would be your opponent is serve and he starts in the add court
1rtprulchqk_13-8-rgb_front he will hit his two serves and if he gets the first one in he will hit one serve
1rtprulchqk_14-8-rgb_front if he wins or loses the point then he goes over to the deuce court and he will serve another two balls or one ball depending on if he gets the first or second one in and you play that point
1rtprulchqk_15-8-rgb_front then it goes to your serve
1rtprulchqk_16-8-rgb_front again you start on the add side you are not starting on the deuce side
1rtprulchqk_17-8-rgb_front only the very first server hits one ball or one point from the deuce side
1rtprulchqk_18-8-rgb_front so you are at the add side you play it now you are scoring
1rtprulchqk_19-8-rgb_front the first one to points you have to win by points and then you have to switch when you are total points total up to
1rtprulchqk_2-8-rgb_front let is say your game score is at
1rtprulchqk_20-8-rgb_front so if it is you switch ends
1rtprulchqk_21-8-rgb_front again like i said the first one to points and wins by you take the set
1rtprulchqk_3-8-rgb_front what do you do
1rtprulchqk_4-8-rgb_front do you keep playing until somebody wins by two games
1rtprulchqk_5-8-rgb_front no
1rtprulchqk_6-8-rgb_front everybody now has this tiebreaker system going
1rtprulchqk_7-8-rgb_front it is the first one to points but you still have to win by points
1rtprulchqk_8-8-rgb_front a point is not a game it is just a regular point
1rtprulchqk_9-8-rgb_front what you do is you start or the first one starts on the right side
1rvy7z3xiv8_1-8-rgb_front in this series of units i have given you a small part of the research findings in negotiating
1rvy7z3xiv8_10-8-rgb_front i will warn you this will happen in major negotiations it happens however much you plan to avoid it in the negotiation itself
1rvy7z3xiv8_11-8-rgb_front the key issue is to avoid blame
1rvy7z3xiv8_12-8-rgb_front the quicker you can get into asking for solutions and what can be done about it the more likely you are to minimize the disruption and the cost of an implementation failure
1rvy7z3xiv8_13-8-rgb_front this has been some ideas on negotiating and i hope that they are ones that you can use in the future
1rvy7z3xiv8_14-8-rgb_front good hunting
1rvy7z3xiv8_2-8-rgb_front if you want to know more about me you can see my details after this final unit
1rvy7z3xiv8_3-8-rgb_front let is look at implementation
1rvy7z3xiv8_4-8-rgb_front it is a big subject and i will cover two points only
1rvy7z3xiv8_5-8-rgb_front first of all particularly if it is a complex implementation involving new technology or involving many departments and people follow up is crucial
1rvy7z3xiv8_6-8-rgb_front the rule about follow up is you do not follow things up when problems arrive you follow up while the ink is still wet on the contract
1rvy7z3xiv8_7-8-rgb_front the quicker you can get into support and follow up the less likely you are to confront problems and difficulties
1rvy7z3xiv8_8-8-rgb_front but they will arise and sometimes people say it is your fault this went wrong
1rvy7z3xiv8_9-8-rgb_front the other side will say no it is not because your position that you took up on this was wrong in the first place
1s1tpdcuvhq_0-8-rgb_front in this clip what we are going to do is identify the area that we are going to pressure wash one of the most things is to identify where the water is going to run off also to make sure no over spray gets any plants
1s1tpdcuvhq_1-8-rgb_front we have already removed some potting plants that were in this area so the water run off does not get to it
1s1tpdcuvhq_10-8-rgb_front once you hit dirt with a pressure washer it is going to blast whatever you see out there
1s1tpdcuvhq_11-8-rgb_front identify the area this looks like a safe zone we are going to get started
1s1tpdcuvhq_2-8-rgb_front if your using any type of cleaners mildew sides there is some organic cleaners out there now that s safe for the environment
1s1tpdcuvhq_3-8-rgb_front you always need to identify where the water is going to go
1s1tpdcuvhq_4-8-rgb_front in this area it seems like the water is going to run down
1s1tpdcuvhq_5_6_7-8-rgb_front it also leads right into how to pressurize you want to start from the top to the bottom water is going to run downhill so it is always beneficial to start from top to bottom okay we have already identified the area there is no problems
1s1tpdcuvhq_8-8-rgb_front had there been any windows that we might need to put a board or a door to make sure there is no water seepage underneath doors
1s1tpdcuvhq_9-8-rgb_front we put up a little shield around those areas but that will not be important right now
1s3uaxarwbi_0-8-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson
1s3uaxarwbi_1-8-rgb_front what we want you to understand is the most important thing about doing conditioning is being able to incorporate as many basketball skills into your conditioning as possible
1s3uaxarwbi_2-8-rgb_front it does us no good to come out and run end to end just for conditioning purposes if we are not somehow trying to translate the skills of basketball into conditioning
1s3uaxarwbi_3-8-rgb_front so what i like to do is try to take any basic skill that i can about the game of basketball and somehow find a way to do conditioning
1s3uaxarwbi_4-8-rgb_front if you are going to shoot the ball you might as well be shooting the ball constantly on the move in a certain time frame in order to get a good conditioning workout
1s3uaxarwbi_5-8-rgb_front if you are going to dribble the ball or run the ball end to end you might as well be dribbling while you are doing it
1s3uaxarwbi_6-8-rgb_front if you can find a way to pass the ball while you are conditioning that is good as well
1s3uaxarwbi_7-8-rgb_front and try to build strength in to the basic skills of basketball is good as well
1s3uaxarwbi_8-8-rgb_front so when you are thinking about setting up conditioning for your practice try to incorporate the basic skills of basketball into each conditioning drill that you do
1s3uaxarwbi_9-8-rgb_front that way not only will your players be more in the skills of basketball they will also get good conditioning at the same time
1s3sdvihora_1-8-rgb_front i want to talk about costumes for a few minutes
1s3sdvihora_10-8-rgb_front that is always nice because we know they are going to fit
1s3sdvihora_11-8-rgb_front then some of the costumes were made for the actors by the person who is in charge of costumes for the show
1s3sdvihora_12-8-rgb_front one of the actors in this place played a police officer who in a sort of a funny scene decided to have tea
1s3sdvihora_13-8-rgb_front he went into the kitchen to make tea and he needed to come out wearing an apron
1s3sdvihora_14-8-rgb_front this apron was made for him by our costume mistress
1s3sdvihora_15-8-rgb_front another fellow in the play was painting his apartment upstairs
1s3sdvihora_16-8-rgb_front you never see the apartment but he keeps coming back into the set with more and more paint all over him
1s3sdvihora_17-8-rgb_front as more and more paint spills and gets splashed around
1s3sdvihora_18-8-rgb_front he had a whole series with different stages paint staining on them that he would change from one to the next as the play progressed
1s3sdvihora_19-8-rgb_front we had people having a lot of fun putting the paint on the and the pants and so on
1s3sdvihora_2-8-rgb_front costumes are acquired in all sorts of different ways for community theater production
1s3sdvihora_20-8-rgb_front he had a lot of fun with the pants
1s3sdvihora_21-8-rgb_front at the end he put a big hand print on it
1s3sdvihora_22-8-rgb_front you can have a lot costumes
1s3sdvihora_23-8-rgb_front as i said there are all sorts of sources for them
1s3sdvihora_24-8-rgb_front makeup is the same thing
1s3sdvihora_25-8-rgb_front the most important thing with makeup is keeping it organized and you need somebody in charge of just keeping the makeup stocked
1s3sdvihora_26-8-rgb_front every actor should have their own box of makeup so that they feel it is sanitary and they know what makeup they are going to use and it does not get all mixed up and so on
1s3sdvihora_27-8-rgb_front the big problem you have with costumes too for that matter is storage space
1s3sdvihora_28-8-rgb_front we will talk more about the storage place problems and how to solve those when we talk about props
1s3sdvihora_3-8-rgb_front this last show that verde valley did run for your wife was a good example
1s3sdvihora_4-8-rgb_front we had quite a variety of costumes in this show
1s3sdvihora_5-8-rgb_front we had men is suits
1s3sdvihora_6-8-rgb_front some of these were donated to us
1s3sdvihora_7-8-rgb_front some of these we acquired at good will industries and if you go to your local thrift shop you can find lots of clothing and other things for the set too props and so on
1s3sdvihora_8-8-rgb_front thrift shops are an excellent source
1s3sdvihora_9-8-rgb_front some of the costumes were supplied by the actors themselves
1s5gc78droe_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is dan schmidt from the chinese martial arts center
1s5gc78droe_1-8-rgb_front and today we are going to be showing you the proper way to perform the jump outside crescent kick
1s5gc78droe_10-8-rgb_front okay
1s5gc78droe_11-8-rgb_front so as soon as you take the second step you have to whip your body around and jump up at the same time to get the proper momentum of the spin
1s5gc78droe_12-8-rgb_front so again so you step out round jump kick
1s5gc78droe_13-8-rgb_front okay a few common errors okay is if you do not step out to the corner enough you are not going to get the proper speed to turn around
1s5gc78droe_14-8-rgb_front so you do not want to take two steps forward and then try to jump up and turn it does not work
1s5gc78droe_15-8-rgb_front so you have to build up that speed by step out turn the foot you see and your body is turning up and then the kick
1s5gc78droe_16-8-rgb_front okay
1s5gc78droe_17-8-rgb_front so once again
1s5gc78droe_18-8-rgb_front so step jump kick
1s5gc78droe_19-8-rgb_front that is the proper way to perform the jump outside crescent kick
1s5gc78droe_2-8-rgb_front okay in this kick there is a variety of steps that have a circular action
1s5gc78droe_3-8-rgb_front okay so starting from a standing position okay your first step you are going to go slightly outward towards the corner
1s5gc78droe_4-8-rgb_front so you are going to step here so one then step as if you are turning two with your toes outward
1s5gc78droe_5-8-rgb_front this is where you are going to be jumping
1s5gc78droe_6-8-rgb_front so your knee comes up as you spin around both hands go out outside crescent kick
1s5gc78droe_7-8-rgb_front okay
1s5gc78droe_8-8-rgb_front so performed at full speed it looks like this
1s5gc78droe_9-8-rgb_front so he runs step jump and kick
1s7e4shqias_1-8-rgb_front in this video clip i would be setting up the sole
1s7e4shqias_10-8-rgb_front now when you flip it over after about seconds the areas that are still pretty dark red are going to be low areas that need to be fixed
1s7e4shqias_11-8-rgb_front to fix it you are going to continue working the plane on the sand paper until all the red areas are completely gone
1s7e4shqias_12-8-rgb_front once all the red is gone you are going to move on to a grit sand paper and even a finer grit sand paper and you are going to continue this until you get a nice smooth finish on the sole of your plane
1s7e4shqias_2-8-rgb_front the sole is the very base of our plane
1s7e4shqias_3-8-rgb_front now we need this to be as flat as possible so we can get nice cuts
1s7e4shqias_4-8-rgb_front first thing we need to do is retract the blade using the depth adjustment lever
1s7e4shqias_5-8-rgb_front next we are going to take a permanent marker and color the bottom
1s7e4shqias_6-8-rgb_front i like to use red cause it shows up a little bit better
1s7e4shqias_7-8-rgb_front next we are going to take grit piece of sand paper and we are going to rub the plane on the sand paper for about seconds
1s7e4shqias_8-8-rgb_front now when you do this you want to make sure that your sand paper is on a true surface
1s7e4shqias_9-8-rgb_front i am using a table saw in this case
1sfvwxhzyjg_1-8-rgb_front so the first step to washing your hands is to have a towel paper towel a sink and antibacterial soap
1sfvwxhzyjg_2-8-rgb_front first thing first so you enter your sink turn your faucet on
1sfvwxhzyjg_3-8-rgb_front make sure it is warm not too scolding hot and good water pressure
1sfvwxhzyjg_4-8-rgb_front completely wet your hands all the way up to your wrist
1sfvwxhzyjg_5-8-rgb_front roll up your sleeves
1sfvwxhzyjg_6-8-rgb_front warm water hot water kills bacteria better than cold water as you would see when you start to soap up
1sfvwxhzyjg_7-8-rgb_front cold water really does not give you a lather
1siq1smnhqm_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to be applying the base coat
1siq1smnhqm_1-8-rgb_front believe it or not the next step in this process is going to be doing the grout color
1siq1smnhqm_10-8-rgb_front and again if you get a little bit on your surface or on your hands it is just craft paint and it will wash off easily
1siq1smnhqm_11-8-rgb_front that is one of the beauties of using this kind of paint it goes a long way it is inexpensive and it is easy to clean up
1siq1smnhqm_12-8-rgb_front you are going to see that it may take a little bit to match the exact grout color that you have and that is why you play with the paint
1siq1smnhqm_13-8-rgb_front it is inexpensive so you can afford to lose a little if you need to
1siq1smnhqm_14-8-rgb_front i like to put a little bit on any kind of white surface a piece of paper a piece of cardboard as long as it is white so that you are working in the same color range
1siq1smnhqm_15-8-rgb_front put a little bit on your paper and then walk it over to your wall and see if you are close to the grout color if not just keep adjusting your paint color
1siq1smnhqm_16-8-rgb_front use a little bit more white a little bit more gray or whatever your grout color happens to be composed of just keep adding keep adding and you will see that as you work this and walk it over to your wall you can see we are getting close
1siq1smnhqm_17-8-rgb_front we may be a little dark or a little light you just keep adjusting until you hit that color that you need there
1siq1smnhqm_18-8-rgb_front and when you think you have got it you come back and you paint your entire switch plate cover including the screws
1siq1smnhqm_19-8-rgb_front make sure you get a good coat
1siq1smnhqm_2-8-rgb_front the reason we are going to put the grout color on first is it is going to cover the entire switch plate and receptacle
1siq1smnhqm_20-8-rgb_front once again this is going to look like stone so it does not need to be absolutely beautiful like a painting you would hang on the wall this is stone this is mother nature at work so we are going to try to copy what she has done
1siq1smnhqm_21-8-rgb_front paint the screws make sure you keep them moving so you do not paint them in so tight that you can not use them again
1siq1smnhqm_22-8-rgb_front just put on a good coat because you are going to come over this again with the stone color
1siq1smnhqm_23-8-rgb_front be sure you hit all the areas the inside
1siq1smnhqm_24-8-rgb_front make sure you let it dry well before you move on
1siq1smnhqm_25-8-rgb_front you are going to paint your receptacle as well watching again for the little holes there so you can keep them free of accumulated paint
1siq1smnhqm_26-8-rgb_front paint the edges because you probably will see some of that
1siq1smnhqm_27-8-rgb_front and if necessary you can go over a second time if after it dries you see that there is some spots that you have missed
1siq1smnhqm_28-8-rgb_front see it does not take much paint at all
1siq1smnhqm_29-8-rgb_front and now believe it or not you have got your grout done and we are ready to move on to the next step
1siq1smnhqm_3-8-rgb_front that way when you put your stone look on it will look like the grout and the stone all came together at once
1siq1smnhqm_4-8-rgb_front you will be amazed at how this works
1siq1smnhqm_5-8-rgb_front picking out your grout colors as i said is probably going to be a matching process
1siq1smnhqm_6-8-rgb_front you are not going to use just one color because grout is a mixture of things in itself so pick colors that are as close to your grout color as possible
1siq1smnhqm_7-8-rgb_front as you can see here i have picked kind of muddy grays and a white because i am going to want to cut the gray down a little bit
1siq1smnhqm_8-8-rgb_front using your little egg tray you are going to squirt a little bit remember a little bit goes a long way and this is a fairly small project so you are not going to need a lot of paint
1siq1smnhqm_9-8-rgb_front keep your colors up so you can see what you are mixing
1sg84_vtrqg_0-8-rgb_front in this segment i am going to talk about jack completing his backswing
1sg84_vtrqg_1-8-rgb_front know thy self and jack knew himself
1sg84_vtrqg_10-8-rgb_front and how many of you discard that swing and bring in another swing a relief pitcher oh i will try that i will try that
1sg84_vtrqg_11_12_13-8-rgb_front jack knew if he started hitting poorly the first place he looked did he complete his backswing full arm swing full shoulder turn full wrist hinge
1sg84_vtrqg_14-8-rgb_front and it also would not hurt you if you start hitting the ball poorly an excellent place to look first is are you completing your backswing
1sg84_vtrqg_15-8-rgb_front because if you are not completing your backswing the only thoughts that will help you is a manipulative that in the future is going to hurt you more than it is going to help you
1sg84_vtrqg_16-8-rgb_front be like jack you are starting to make some mistakes on the course make sure you are completing your backswing
1sg84_vtrqg_2-8-rgb_front and he knew when his game was off his first check point was am i completing my backswing
1sg84_vtrqg_3-8-rgb_front and by completing a backswing to him that meant extension full arm swing full shoulder turn and full wrist hinge
1sg84_vtrqg_4-8-rgb_front completing the backswing
1sg84_vtrqg_5-8-rgb_front when he did not complete his backswing very often like many of us if you do not complete your backswing you make a move you are in front of the ball club face is open moving to the right push fade
1sg84_vtrqg_6-8-rgb_front and that is what jack would do most of the time if he did not complete his backswing
1sg84_vtrqg_7-8-rgb_front but the point is he knew the major mistake in his swing he knew the first thing that went wrong
1sg84_vtrqg_8-8-rgb_front do you know the first thing that goes wrong when you start hitting the ball poorly
1sg84_vtrqg_9-8-rgb_front even if your answer is yes you may not be correct
1spcnubmwyk_0-8-rgb_front hi
1spcnubmwyk_10-8-rgb_front remember that you always want to be very careful of whatever bodies of water
1spcnubmwyk_11-8-rgb_front it does not take much for a child to drown
1spcnubmwyk_12-8-rgb_front be sure that all of the buckets are either up out of baby is reach or that your child is secured out away from the kitchen if you are cleaning
1spcnubmwyk_2-8-rgb_front something that you are going to want to remember is that it takes very very little water for a child to drown

1spcnubmwyk_4-8-rgb_front a crawler can very easily crawl into the kitchen
1spcnubmwyk_5-8-rgb_front remember babies are kind of top heavy
1spcnubmwyk_6-8-rgb_front a crawler can actually tip over into a bucket and drown with just a couple of inches of water
1spcnubmwyk_7-8-rgb_front if you are cleaning your kitchen and mopping the floor you want to be really careful that you have kept your child out of the area
1spcnubmwyk_8-8-rgb_front whether it is putting him in his crib or playpen or gating it off with the baby gates that we have discussed

1syo65y29zm_3-8-rgb_front we need a big a large stainless steel casserole dish
1syo65y29zm_4-8-rgb_front this is going to be used for the top of the stove
1syo65y29zm_5-8-rgb_front it can go inside the stove too but we are not going to need to do that in this case has a nice lid to it a sharp chefs knife
1syo65y29zm_6-8-rgb_front i have a variety of pairing knifes because there is a quite a few of vegetables in this dish so we are going to have to prep those
1syo65y29zm_7-8-rgb_front i have a whisk cause we are going to whisk in brown sugar and spices into the sauce that we are going to make a pair of tongs of course
1syo65y29zm_8-8-rgb_front then i have a pineapple knife to slice the pineapple
1syo65y29zm_9-8-rgb_front i got this at the dull plantation in hawaii and it is great for slicing pineapple and skinning pineapple as well as for other things like great fruit segments and things like that
1szb5o0henu_0-8-rgb_front i am going to give carrie here a nice neck massage
1szb5o0henu_1-8-rgb_front but i am going to use the pillow here for a little bit of her comfort and my comfort
1szb5o0henu_10-8-rgb_front rub it out give it a little loving kindness and there you have got a neck massage
1szb5o0henu_2-8-rgb_front so place the pillow behind the back i am going to come into an open diamond stance knees on either side of our hips
1szb5o0henu_3-8-rgb_front i am going to have her tilt her head gently forward
1szb5o0henu_4-8-rgb_front intertwine my fingers palms towards the neck rest them on and then start gently massaging as you pull the heels of the hands back
1szb5o0henu_5-8-rgb_front and again do not stay in one position kind of go up and down a little bit back and forth
1szb5o0henu_6-8-rgb_front try not to be too rough
1szb5o0henu_7-8-rgb_front if you feel your client getting tense you know to back up just a little bit ease up just a little bit perfect
1szb5o0henu_8-8-rgb_front then after you do that you can give her a nice little massage with neck and shoulders
1szb5o0henu_9-8-rgb_front so i am going to just gently rub the neck rub the shoulders
1t4zyrqiw1s_0-8-rgb_front alright let is talk now about how to unhook a fish
1t4zyrqiw1s_1-8-rgb_front i just caught this little black crappy and now when you hook a fish the hook can be anywhere depending on the orientation of the hook when the fish bit
1t4zyrqiw1s_10-8-rgb_front if you use barbless hooks it is a lot easier
1t4zyrqiw1s_11-8-rgb_front one thing that i find helpful is to often have a pair of pliers
1t4zyrqiw1s_12-8-rgb_front much better for taking the hooks out much easier on your fingers much easier on the fish
1t4zyrqiw1s_2-8-rgb_front it could be in the lower jaw the side the upper jaw back in the throat a little bit sometimes it is more some areas are more difficult to take the hook out than others
1t4zyrqiw1s_3-8-rgb_front if you have a treble hook that makes it even more difficult
1t4zyrqiw1s_4-8-rgb_front what you want to make sure first of all is that with fish that have spines such as your pan fish your perch your bass the spines are typically on the anal fin the dorsal fin sometimes in the ventral fins and often at the edge of the operculum there will be a small spine
1t4zyrqiw1s_5-8-rgb_front so you want to stay away from those areas as best you can
1t4zyrqiw1s_6-8-rgb_front try to smooth the fins down before you grab them
1t4zyrqiw1s_7-8-rgb_front make sure that you have a firm grasp on that fish at all times
1t4zyrqiw1s_8-8-rgb_front and that will keep you from getting spined and it will be better for the fish
1t4zyrqiw1s_9-8-rgb_front and then you simply reach in try to take the back side of the hook if you can and you pop it right out
1tip58dn8nw_0-5-rgb_front now the eyes are completely done and they look fantastic
1tip58dn8nw_1-5-rgb_front but the finishing touch is now are the lips
1tip58dn8nw_10-5-rgb_front a lot of benefits from using a little bit of lip liner
1tip58dn8nw_11-5-rgb_front keep it very neutral you do not want it look like a harsh lip line basically shaping the lips
1tip58dn8nw_12-5-rgb_front now we are ready to start with the lipstick
1tip58dn8nw_2-5-rgb_front this is the signature point of this look is with the old hollywood starlet it was normally that red madonna red but with the flapper look it was that more dark glossy shiny we are going to combine the two with a burgundy shimmery glossy type lip
1tip58dn8nw_3-5-rgb_front so i am going to start with a burgundy lip liner
1tip58dn8nw_4-5-rgb_front she has nice full lips so i am not going to overdraw her lips i am just going to trace her natural lip line and just fill it in with the lip liner
1tip58dn8nw_5-5-rgb_front this is where you create a nice shape for your lips like that rosebud lips or if you like those pointed lips which is up to you
1tip58dn8nw_6-5-rgb_front she has a great natural lip line so i am just going to trace that completely
1tip58dn8nw_7-5-rgb_front and again fill it in because you do not want to see the lip liner
1tip58dn8nw_8-5-rgb_front you want it to all look natural and blended
1tip58dn8nw_9-5-rgb_front also filling in your lips with a lip liner will help your lipstick stay on longer and it will prevent from bleeding
1th1wrwlp30_0-8-rgb_front hello
1th1wrwlp30_1-8-rgb_front my name is terry neven
1th1wrwlp30_10-8-rgb_front record keeping for grade and under is not as crucial as high school
1th1wrwlp30_11-8-rgb_front high school record keeping is absolutely important specifically for graduating earning a diploma or going on to college or university
1th1wrwlp30_12-8-rgb_front you can also have in a student is cum folder other pieces of record keeping such as test results or any other studies about a child is learning style or things that are relative to understanding how the child learns and the things that face them
1th1wrwlp30_13-8-rgb_front record keeping can be important but it is not anything we have to lose sleep over
1th1wrwlp30_14-8-rgb_front you can enroll your child in any public school or most private schools throughout the state of california without an immunization record and no paper trail
1th1wrwlp30_15-8-rgb_front but paper trail can be helpful
1th1wrwlp30_16-8-rgb_front record keeping can be an important part of home schooling
1th1wrwlp30_2-8-rgb_front i am the administrator of california home educators and principal of sunland christian school
1th1wrwlp30_3-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about record keeping for families who home school
1th1wrwlp30_4-8-rgb_front a paper trail is an important part of helping everyone understand what has occurred with a child in their development and education
1th1wrwlp30_5-8-rgb_front in almost every state it is important to have immunization records or immunization waiver
1th1wrwlp30_6-8-rgb_front most home school programs throughout the united states have some sort of paper trail in order to help you with this record keeping process
1th1wrwlp30_7-8-rgb_front usually it involves three things
1th1wrwlp30_8-8-rgb_front a piece of paper that tells what we are going to accomplish this year
1th1wrwlp30_9-8-rgb_front a piece of paper that documents days that schooling occurs and finally some form of a report card or transcript of the grades that students have earned and what work completed during that school year
1thcohyinqk_0-8-rgb_front okay we have worked around our third level side one corner one side two corner two all the way to these third corners third side and our very last corner
1thcohyinqk_1-8-rgb_front we have gotten half way in here and now we are going to chain two and do our last set of three there is one there is two and there is three
1thcohyinqk_2-8-rgb_front then again we are going to chain one to keep our float and our pattern and our sizing the same we are going to go one two three and get our needle in there
1thcohyinqk_3-8-rgb_front this does take practice and i still have trouble getting my needle to go through some times
1thcohyinqk_4-8-rgb_front we are going to go through right here pull it down really tight and make sure you have got that loop through a decent amount and you are going to cut it and now with this yarn and especially since this is our outside and we are going to add our border we really want to do this tight because when we are working our border we are going to be working our needle in through these holes
1thcohyinqk_5-8-rgb_front go ahead and just pull it through from the top pull it through just like that but really make sure you get a nice good pull on it because we are going to be working through this area
1thcohyinqk_6-8-rgb_front now continue until they are all the way hidden and then we will be adding our border
1tmg7yrz4e0_0-8-rgb_front my name is alex lowe and i am an entry level engineer for weber elliot engineers in eugene oregon and i am here to tell you about how much an entry level engineer would make
1tmg7yrz4e0_1-8-rgb_front an entry level engineer can start out making twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year in us dollars and they basically will stay in at that level for probably six to twelve months and then they can move up their salary can increase maybe a couple to five thousand a year until they get plateau at a certain level which we will say is thousand a year maybe
1tmg7yrz4e0_2-8-rgb_front and as much as thousand dollars a year depending on where you are
1tmg7yrz4e0_3-8-rgb_front and that will that will cap off because then you need to have in order to get more money you have to have an actual degree
1tmg7yrz4e0_4-8-rgb_front you have to have a certification that makes you more of a valuable employee to an engineering firm
1trykcirb40_0-8-rgb_front so our next step is going to be conditioning the hair
1trykcirb40_1-8-rgb_front after you are done applying a chemical to your hair you are going to feel that it is a bit dry
1trykcirb40_10-8-rgb_front this may seem that it is a long process but it is going to help especially at the end when you rinse it and get rid of any tangles that you might have
1trykcirb40_11-8-rgb_front just go ahead and go to our next step
1trykcirb40_2-8-rgb_front so you are going to want to use a moisturizing condition to kick some moisture back in there
1trykcirb40_3-8-rgb_front so what we are going to is start by putting the conditioner in your hand mixing it up and pull it through your ends
1trykcirb40_4-8-rgb_front taking it by section by section at least the first time you have done the chemical service take it section by section
1trykcirb40_5-8-rgb_front then go back in and massage it into your scalp cause you are going to want to moisturize your hair
1trykcirb40_6-8-rgb_front it is going to be very dry it is going to be thirsty so we are going to feed it
1trykcirb40_7-8-rgb_front pull it through your hands and then what you can do is go ahead and grab your wide tooth comb
1trykcirb40_8-8-rgb_front take it in sections and just comb it through your ends
1trykcirb40_9-8-rgb_front take it in sections and comb it through your ends
1tuycqctmd8_0-5-rgb_front okay now is the point where we are actually going to clean the record
1tuycqctmd8_1-5-rgb_front so you have got your record you have got your cleaner on the record you have got your cleaning medium i will be using my diaper
1tuycqctmd8_2-5-rgb_front i am just taking one little corner of it getting it so i only have a small piece of it because it is pretty useful if you are cleaning a lot of records in a row to conserve space
1tuycqctmd8_3-5-rgb_front you do not really want to use the same piece too many times maybe two records in a row but maybe not
1tuycqctmd8_4-5-rgb_front though if you are only cleaning one record you do not have to worry about that
1tuycqctmd8_5-5-rgb_front you can take it put it right on it is not going to damage your record you can rub it forward and you kind of just shift and keep it going in a circular motion
1tuycqctmd8_6-5-rgb_front you can do it as quickly or slowly as you want to
1tuycqctmd8_7-5-rgb_front make sure not to touch the inside because this record cleaner will take off the coloring on the inside of the record
1tuycqctmd8_8-5-rgb_front and you can go around a quite a few times just make sure it is clean
1ukrohtnhd4_0-8-rgb_front once you decide upon the purpose your fence will hold then next thing you want to choose is your style height and color
1ukrohtnhd4_1-8-rgb_front for example if i have a house with white accents such as white window frames white exterior doors and white rain gutters then obviously your best bet would be a white solid privacy
1ukrohtnhd4_2-8-rgb_front if you have a house with tan accents however then your best bet would most likely be a tan solid privacy fence
1ukrohtnhd4_3-8-rgb_front for houses that have the ability to do both colors you can also do a option such as this which is a white frame and a tan center
1ukrohtnhd4_4-8-rgb_front once you decide your color the next thing you want to do is choose your height
1ukrohtnhd4_5-8-rgb_front if you are installing your fence in your backyard only you most likely want to do a five to a six foot height fence
1ukrohtnhd4_6-8-rgb_front be it semi private or solid
1ukrohtnhd4_7-8-rgb_front if you are installing your fence along your front yard then your best option would most likely be a three foot height or a four foot height
1uxvmh-7lmi_0-8-rgb_front hi this is yolanda vanveen from vanveenbulbs com
1uxvmh-7lmi_1-8-rgb_front in this segment we will talk about what kind of flowers should i put in my yard
1uxvmh-7lmi_10-8-rgb_front so when you are picking out plants make sure to take in account what the leaves look like what the fragrances are and if they are not fragrant if they are fragrant and it is all about you again
1uxvmh-7lmi_11-8-rgb_front i love the spots and i love the different textures of the cleopatra it is gorgeous
1uxvmh-7lmi_12-8-rgb_front and i love all the tropical plants that we can get away with growing in the northwest
1uxvmh-7lmi_13-8-rgb_front this is my mandevilla or my plants and it is just a vine but i love the bright red flowers and i love that humming birds really really enjoy it
1uxvmh-7lmi_14-8-rgb_front and next to that i have my gladiolus meriali are also know as acidenthera and i just love it it has a nice fragrance like grape bubblegum and it has little spots in the middle that are burgundy that are just gorgeous so it is a really really really pretty plant
1uxvmh-7lmi_15-8-rgb_front but there is another ten thousand to a hundred thousand plants that we have not talked about
1uxvmh-7lmi_16-8-rgb_front so gardening to me is just like meeting everybody else that you meet in your life you enjoy their company when they are there and you invite them over whenever you can but you realized that you can not possibly have every plant in the world in your garden and it is about change some plants stay for years and years some plants go away after two years but i never take it personally because i know there is many more plants that i can meet in the future that will enjoy my garden
1uxvmh-7lmi_17-8-rgb_front so when i am trying to decide what kind of plants to put in my garden i look through magazines i look through web pages i look through different websites that have different ideas and i realize that plants will never do the same in my yard as they do in other peoples yards just as people will never act the same at your parties as they will at other peoples parties but in the end it really does not matter all that matters is that you have a good time at your garden and that is my advice just plant plants when you can find them and enjoy their company when you can
1uxvmh-7lmi_2-8-rgb_front now when i garden i always remember that it is my garden and your garden is your garden and it is all about you
1uxvmh-7lmi_3-8-rgb_front so when i am planting flowers in my garden i try not to take too many things too seriously because in the end it is all about me and what i enjoy
1uxvmh-7lmi_4-8-rgb_front and so i like to look on the internet onto different websites that give you lots of different ideas on what to plant in your garden but when it comes down to it i just collect plants wherever i go and that is a good rule of thumb
1uxvmh-7lmi_5-8-rgb_front if you go to a garden center farmers market and you see something that you like and you have got a sunny spot and it will do well in the sun plant it there
1uxvmh-7lmi_6-8-rgb_front you do not always have to know the names of everybody that comes to your party to enjoy their company so i try to remember the names of the plants that i purchase but of course i forget some of the names and in the end that does not really matter because all that matter is that you enjoy your garden because it is an extension of you
1uxvmh-7lmi_7-8-rgb_front you can have a very formal garden with everything marked and everything simple and not very crowded or you can have just a big summer party and a big barbecue bash and you can mix and match all different types of plants that like the sun or the shade and just put groups of them all over and you can move them around later and you do not have to be strict with it either it is whatever you want to do
1uxvmh-7lmi_8-8-rgb_front so my favorite plants that i have in my garden and that i would definitely recommend are the following plants this is my gold millennium gold it likes full hot sun and i love it because its got spotted leaves and its got these bright lemony yellow flowers that last almost all summer long and it will keep blooming for lots and lots of periods of time and i love that it will do full hot sun more than shade because i have got a lot of sun and it does really well
1uxvmh-7lmi_9-8-rgb_front this cleopatra is of course one of my most favorite plants in my garden and i have got some in the garden i have got some in containers i love the striped leaves
1udh8eah5es_0-8-rgb_front hi
1udh8eah5es_10-8-rgb_front a friend and i where traveling together and came across a place that serves this garlic cloves amazing we have been looking forward every since but we where over seas
1udh8eah5es_11-8-rgb_front anyway here is our garlic and we would add that to our onions and set it aside as we continue to build our ingredients and our base for our sauce
1udh8eah5es_2-8-rgb_front okay now we are going to work with our garlic and once again a good way to peel garlic is to twist it and get a little pop there and then the skin would peel right off
1udh8eah5es_3-8-rgb_front let is see and lets try something else i smash my garlic a lot of time before i chop it anyways but i have always been told if you take with the skin on and just hit it that is another way to get the skin off really easy
1udh8eah5es_4-8-rgb_front i did not seem that easy i like my method better but there it comes
1udh8eah5es_5-8-rgb_front take that part off
1udh8eah5es_6-8-rgb_front anyway like i said i smash my garlic give a little smash or if you have some gadgets you can just put it in a small chopper and chop your garlic up
1udh8eah5es_7-8-rgb_front of course you can do your onions like that you can do your bell pepper i would not suggest tomato unless you want your tomato puree more then chopped
1udh8eah5es_8-8-rgb_front but we would chop our garlic up give a nice and edible and in spaghetti many times or in any dish a lot of times it is not a pleasant thing to just come across a big chunk of garlic as your eating unless your like me and you like garlic you look forward to that
1udh8eah5es_9-8-rgb_front anyway we can chop our garlic garlic i love it
1wa2jhu3jj4_0-8-rgb_front now that i have carved some of my block of wood i might want to see how it is going to look in the final image
1wa2jhu3jj4_1-8-rgb_front therefore i can pull a proof which is essentially a printed image that gives me an idea of where i am going with my block of wood
1wa2jhu3jj4_2-8-rgb_front in order to do that i am going to first need to put some ink on my pallet and use my brayer to make a sheet of ink
1wa2jhu3jj4_3-8-rgb_front i am using etching ink for my woodblocks
1wa2jhu3jj4_4-8-rgb_front there are relief printmaking inks but there is a limited number of pigments available
1wa2jhu3jj4_5-8-rgb_front you can use etching ink you can use lithography ink
1wa2jhu3jj4_6-8-rgb_front the only difference is in the viscosity of the ink which you can alter for your uses for what you need
1wa2jhu3jj4_7-8-rgb_front here this ink from the tube is just going to be perfectly fine to get what we need for this proof
1wa2jhu3jj4_8-8-rgb_front so i have put a dollop of the ink onto my pallet and in order to make the sheet of ink that i need i am just going to kiss a little bit of that ink with this brayer so that i can make a nice even sheet of ink for my block of wood
1wefeqn5emk_10-8-rgb_front and then we will do that the same with our next piece and when they are both done we are going to put them together and cut again just to make sure that there are no large chunks of garlic
1wefeqn5emk_11-8-rgb_front we will move this over to the side and we will take just a little bit of our rosemary and we will chop it
1wefeqn5emk_12-8-rgb_front i am using just the little ends from that little piece is off because the stem that would be in here is very very soft
1wefeqn5emk_13-8-rgb_front alright now we are going to come back to our chicken
1wefeqn5emk_14-8-rgb_front and again it is not cooked all the way but that is alright because we are going to be putting our sauce in here and then roasting it in the oven
1wefeqn5emk_15-8-rgb_front so we will pull this out and we are keeping this oil in here because we do not want our garlic to burn we just want to keep the flavor of the chicken
1wefeqn5emk_16-8-rgb_front so we will add our garlic and our capicola or our prosciutto and we are going to want to add some wine white wine to deglaze the pan
1wefeqn5emk_17-8-rgb_front and now that we have liquid in here i am going to add our fresh herbs so that they do not burn
1wefeqn5emk_18-8-rgb_front and then to give it a little bit more flavor we will come back to our vegetable stock and we will add an equal amount of that as we have with the rice
1wefeqn5emk_19-8-rgb_front so about a half a cup to a cup each
1wefeqn5emk_2-8-rgb_front but because we are going to be cooking this chicken a couple of times that means it is just marked
1wefeqn5emk_20-8-rgb_front and then we are going to let this boil and reduce
1wefeqn5emk_3-8-rgb_front so you can see it is nice and white and move it till it is where the majority of the oil is and now we will start preparing our sauce
1wefeqn5emk_4-8-rgb_front so we have already cut our capicola or our prosciutto so we are going to take two cloves of garlic
1wefeqn5emk_5-8-rgb_front we are going to look at each end
1wefeqn5emk_6-8-rgb_front one end is smooth and one has like a little brown stem
1wefeqn5emk_7-8-rgb_front so we are going to cut that off both parts and then we are going to remove them because that is about the size that we want to chop our garlic
1wefeqn5emk_8-8-rgb_front so we will grab the sides and chop and then we will do it again
1wefeqn5emk_9-8-rgb_front see the garlic is going to rise up the edge of the knife so we will just pull that back down
1wma0tuwzri_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is joe and i am at breaktime billiards in wilmington north carolina and today we are going to talk about leveling a pool table
1wma0tuwzri_1-8-rgb_front pool tables come in three piece slate and one piece slate
1wma0tuwzri_2-8-rgb_front on a three piece slate they fit together as one two and three
1wma0tuwzri_3-8-rgb_front and what you want to be able to do is you want to be able to level the slate before you put the cloth on
1wma0tuwzri_4-8-rgb_front they do this by shimming
1wma0tuwzri_5-8-rgb_front you can use playing cards which is a awful easy way to do it
1wma0tuwzri_6-8-rgb_front and you are going to lay your level over the corners of the table and the length
1wma0tuwzri_7-8-rgb_front and you are going to put if if it is low on one end you are going to put the card on that end to try to bring that part of the slate up
1wma0tuwzri_8-8-rgb_front it is a trial and error type method as to how many shims you need or playing cards
1wma0tuwzri_9-8-rgb_front but once you have done this then the slate is level
1wtse0nk5tk_0-8-rgb_front i would like to have a discussion on electromagnetic fields now
1wtse0nk5tk_1-8-rgb_front in other words electronics in the bedroom
1wtse0nk5tk_10-8-rgb_front also what is important to know what is behind that headboard what is behind on the other side of the wall
1wtse0nk5tk_11-8-rgb_front i had a client who had the walls full of electronics on the other side and she had constant headaches and her immune system was really suffering and she did not know why
1wtse0nk5tk_12-8-rgb_front so after i pointed out they actually moved electronics in the other room to the other corner and her health improved dramatically after that
1wtse0nk5tk_2-8-rgb_front so our lives are full of electronics electronics is everywhere
1wtse0nk5tk_3-8-rgb_front so and it radiates different frequencies and we are exposed all day long to it
1wtse0nk5tk_4-8-rgb_front so our immune system is really getting bitten
1wtse0nk5tk_5-8-rgb_front and you want to have this one room in your life where you can come home at night and rest from all of the exposure
1wtse0nk5tk_6-8-rgb_front you really do not want to have too much electronics in your bedroom
1wtse0nk5tk_7-8-rgb_front you do not want to have all those and dvds players and phones and it is very important not to have your alarm clock and phone right by your head so that i see quite often
1wtse0nk5tk_8-8-rgb_front so if you can jane here has simple quartz clock that she changed from an electric clock so this is much safer
1wtse0nk5tk_9-8-rgb_front so if you really need to have that electronics in the bedroom just put it as far away from you as possible
1xku91gglei_0-5-rgb_front have you woken up the next day pounding headache dry mouth realized it may have been the amount of drink you had last night
1xku91gglei_1-5-rgb_front well i am here to tell you about what is the best vodka to end up without a hangover
1xku91gglei_10-5-rgb_front the next thing about absolut is you could drink a vodka water with absolut because absolut has a distinctive slight sweetness at the very end of it
1xku91gglei_11-5-rgb_front so that and water you still get a little sweetness in your drink without having to mix it with any of those dangerous sugars that are going to laid to you being dehydrated the next day
1xku91gglei_12-5-rgb_front so best way to keep drinking all night and not going to hangover the next day stick with absolut and stick with it and on water
1xku91gglei_13-5-rgb_front my name is jeff klein and bartender and vodka connoisseur here at beak is old florida and that is the best vodka for no hangover
1xku91gglei_2-5-rgb_front how are you
1xku91gglei_3-5-rgb_front my name is jeff klein and i am a vodka connoisseur and bartender here at beak is old florida in st petersburg
1xku91gglei_4-5-rgb_front now for me the importance of the best vodka is going to be absolut
1xku91gglei_5-5-rgb_front that is going to be your best vodka for no hangover for many reasons
1xku91gglei_6-5-rgb_front one it is a premium vodka
1xku91gglei_7-5-rgb_front so you are not getting any type of impurities in there
1xku91gglei_8-5-rgb_front two the best way not to get a hangover is to cut out the sugar while you are drinking
1xku91gglei_9-5-rgb_front one of the biggest things that leads to hangover is when your mixing your vodka with orange juice soda red bull all of those sugars are going to dehydrate you and really that is what lands to your hangover
1xl3mojkx84_0-8-rgb_front now i am going to show you the supplies we are going to need to make our paddle ball
1xl3mojkx84_1-8-rgb_front we are going to make our handle out of cardboard corrugated cardboard box or carton
1xl3mojkx84_2-8-rgb_front the size of the cardboard should be big enough to make two paddles because they are going to be actually our one paddle is going to have two layers to it
1xl3mojkx84_3-8-rgb_front so take the size of the round head of the paddle that you want using the plate of the bowl and make sure that you have enough for two of those the same sized paddles to be cut out from that cardboard
1xl3mojkx84_4-8-rgb_front so we are going to need the cardboard and a plate to measure our circle for the head of the paddle
1xl3mojkx84_5-8-rgb_front we are going to have to have a pencil on hand and a scissors along with a paintbrush for decorating the paddle
1yemyc7n3du_10-8-rgb_front so the way you want to approach it is you actually want to attack the front foot with the ball
1yemyc7n3du_11-8-rgb_front so what is i mean attacking the front foot
1yemyc7n3du_12-8-rgb_front so basically you want to position the ball towards that area the area of the front foot okay
1yemyc7n3du_13-8-rgb_front pretend that you are actually going to go one way and then actually while he is distracted or while he is coming at you the moment that he is ready to stop to defend or to start moving backwards then you pass the ball through his legs and then you go around him as as you receive the ball on the other end
1yemyc7n3du_14-8-rgb_front so again we are attacking the front foot
1yemyc7n3du_15-8-rgb_front why the front foot
1yemyc7n3du_16-8-rgb_front because that is where his weight is and it is more difficult for him to turn this way to try to stop me okay
1yemyc7n3du_17-8-rgb_front but at the same time because we know that he is going to have his legs open okay and i am going to take advantage of that i want to put right between his legs the ball goes through the legs and i run to the side because i know he will have a harder time catching me
1yemyc7n3du_18-8-rgb_front okay
1yemyc7n3du_19-8-rgb_front so if you want to have some fun with it you can start with your friends you know
1yemyc7n3du_20-8-rgb_front pretend that at a park you know let em do it
1yfeo-of5b0_10-8-rgb_front the next thing you want to do is make sure you can get some hot liquids into you or perhaps even an mre
1yfeo-of5b0_11-8-rgb_front we always bring with us a ready to each meal
1yfeo-of5b0_12-8-rgb_front these can be purchased at stores across the country
1yfeo-of5b0_13-8-rgb_front and always bring a thermos full of real hot coffee or soup
1yfeo-of5b0_6-8-rgb_front you can get these at any outdoor store and they unfold from a very compact piece
1yfeo-of5b0_7-8-rgb_front they are essentially like a mylar aluminum type foil
1yfeo-of5b0_8-8-rgb_front by putting these over your body
1yfeo-of5b0_9-8-rgb_front even if you are buck naked it will reflect your body heat and retain it
1ycksw3bsvs_0-8-rgb_front okay this last one is a little bit of a challenge but once you practice the straddle splits and the leg training your legs will start to get much stronger
1ycksw3bsvs_4-8-rgb_front so it looks something like this
1ycksw3bsvs_5-8-rgb_front now it is not always easy but if you practice this for a while eventually you should be able to do it without too much trouble
1ypykgsphka_0-8-rgb_front okay there are some important important regulations when it comes to stepping over the sidelines of the piste
1ypykgsphka_1-8-rgb_front so if in the course of a bout one fencer slips over the edge with one or both feet a halt is always called by the referee
1ypykgsphka_10-8-rgb_front if my armor had already been extended and i had been in and touched even just after i had stepped off with one foot the touch would still be in my favor
1ypykgsphka_11-8-rgb_front so the rules get a little bit convoluted but it is important to remember first of all to stay on the strip
1ypykgsphka_12-8-rgb_front second of all that it is better to step off with one foot than with two feet if possible and also that the score will also go in your opponent is favor if you step off the the piste
1ypykgsphka_13-8-rgb_front so you want to remember to at all costs keep your feet within the lines
1ypykgsphka_2-8-rgb_front so in the event that in the action i slipped off with both feet say i was getting a little overzealous in a repost and crossed over lost my balance in a lunge and ended up off to the side a halt would be called
1ypykgsphka_3-8-rgb_front if i had scored a touch it would not count
1ypykgsphka_4-8-rgb_front if my opponent had scored a touch it would count as long as it had happened immediately after i had stepped over the edge
1ypykgsphka_5-8-rgb_front now if i would only stepped over with one foot a halt would also be called
1ypykgsphka_6-8-rgb_front the same rules would hold true my touch would not count
1ypykgsphka_7-8-rgb_front even if we both touched at the same time siri would score a point a touch but i would not
1ypykgsphka_8-8-rgb_front and if she scored a touch immediately after my touch then she would win
1ypykgsphka_9-8-rgb_front there is an exception here however whereas if i had begun the action before i stepped off the sidelines which is to say if i would established and actually legally begun the attack in that case it probably would have been true
1yq7yp8dda8_0-8-rgb_front so you are thinking about laser hair removal and you are curious about some of the side effects
1yq7yp8dda8_1-8-rgb_front my name is keeley selvage with keeley is skin solutions and i have been a licensed clinical aesthetician for over a half a decade
1yq7yp8dda8_10-8-rgb_front get a loofah and rub your body
1yq7yp8dda8_11-8-rgb_front you should be good to go as far as that
1yq7yp8dda8_12-8-rgb_front you also do run the risk of a slight bacterial infection
1yq7yp8dda8_13-8-rgb_front if there is a small wound maybe a small burn on the skin your doctor can give you an
1yq7yp8dda8_14-8-rgb_front that is no problem
1yq7yp8dda8_15-8-rgb_front and you just keep it clean and take care of that
1yq7yp8dda8_16-8-rgb_front also if you have a history of herpes simplex it can cause one
1yq7yp8dda8_17-8-rgb_front so see the physician
1yq7yp8dda8_18-8-rgb_front get an medication prescription and again that should be good
1yq7yp8dda8_19-8-rgb_front so laser hair removal is very safe
1yq7yp8dda8_2-8-rgb_front i am going to talk to you about some of the side effects of laser hair removal
1yq7yp8dda8_20-8-rgb_front there is very few side effects and it is an excellent treatment
1yq7yp8dda8_21-8-rgb_front i am keeley selvage with keeley is skin solution and that is all about laser hair removal
1yq7yp8dda8_3-8-rgb_front for the most part it is very safe
1yq7yp8dda8_4-8-rgb_front it is a very effective way to get rid of that unwanted hair but one thing you might want to think about is after the treatment you might experience some redness some swelling and some sensitivity
1yq7yp8dda8_5-8-rgb_front so you want to make sure that you are avoiding the sun and really any hot temperatures
1yq7yp8dda8_6-8-rgb_front make sure your shower is maybe luke warm because it is just going to irritate the skin
1yq7yp8dda8_7-8-rgb_front you could also break out a little bit in the area and maybe even get some ingrown hairs because once those little hairs start to work their way out they can just turn in in the skin
1yq7yp8dda8_8-8-rgb_front it does not break the skin
1yq7yp8dda8_9-8-rgb_front one thing you can do to help that is exfoliate ten days after the treatment
1yvskpdzcps_0-8-rgb_front this beginner pilates exercise is called the double leg stretch
1yvskpdzcps_1-8-rgb_front this is the second exercise part of what we called the five abs series
1yvskpdzcps_10-8-rgb_front now where do you want to look
1yvskpdzcps_11-8-rgb_front you want to look towards your legs try to avoid looking up towards the ceiling
1yvskpdzcps_12_13_14-8-rgb_front you want to really protect that neck so looking forward contracting those abs perform about eight to ten reps and that is your double leg stretch
1yvskpdzcps_2-8-rgb_front so really concentrate on pulling your abdominal muscles and focus on your breath
1yvskpdzcps_3-8-rgb_front come on down to the mat and bring your knees in towards your chest lifting your head and shoulders up off the mat
1yvskpdzcps_4-8-rgb_front gently place your hands on the outside of your lower legs and we are going to extend the arms and the legs in opposition
1yvskpdzcps_5-8-rgb_front when you extend your legs pull your legs into a pilates dance which means your heels are together and your toes are out like a v keep the small of your back down to the mat
1yvskpdzcps_6-8-rgb_front and then circle your arms around and bring your knees into your chest
1yvskpdzcps_7-8-rgb_front so inhale as you open exhale bring your knees in
1yvskpdzcps_8-8-rgb_front inhale extend exhale bring it in
1yvskpdzcps_9-8-rgb_front straight arms over head then circle around
1zagxilytwm_1-8-rgb_front it is fairly easy to do but it does have some key things from our titration kit
1zagxilytwm_10-8-rgb_front i am going to put this on here until i get just a gram
1zagxilytwm_11-8-rgb_front i have to be really careful cause a gram is not much
1zagxilytwm_2-8-rgb_front the first thing i am going to do is i am going to measure out a liter of water
1zagxilytwm_3-8-rgb_front this is distilled water so i am just going to pour a liter of water
1zagxilytwm_4-8-rgb_front i just have a marking here i am watching and i try and be as exact as possible
1zagxilytwm_5-8-rgb_front okay
1zagxilytwm_6-8-rgb_front so we got a liter there
1zagxilytwm_7-8-rgb_front and i am going to measure out a gram of catalyst which is potassium hydroxide in this case
1zewb1eodzw_5-8-rgb_front so first i will trim off the top to make it straight and then i will cut two four inch strips
1zewb1eodzw_6-8-rgb_front and we are going to sew together the four inch strips and sort of quilt them to make it extra strong
1zewb1eodzw_7-8-rgb_front give it a little bit more heaviness on the bottom of the bag
1zewb1eodzw_8-8-rgb_front you could even sew in a little bit of interfacing in here if you want to make it a nice stiff bottom
1zewb1eodzw_9-8-rgb_front so for the quilting we will put the two pieces together and we will go to the machine and quilt them together
1zqyqrcybrs_1-5-rgb_front this is a russet potato
1zqyqrcybrs_10-5-rgb_front so that is it for potatoes thank you have a good day
1zqyqrcybrs_2-5-rgb_front when you look at your potato you want to make sure that the potato has a nice even color all the way around it whether it be a red potato or a brown potato like this one
1zqyqrcybrs_3-5-rgb_front you want to make sure the color is even all the way around
1zqyqrcybrs_4-5-rgb_front you want to make sure also that it is firm all the way around no dents no bruising
1zqf384lx3m_0-8-rgb_front let is get on to our last stretch
1zqf384lx3m_1-8-rgb_front it is a good stretch for the shoulders
1zqf384lx3m_10-8-rgb_front make sure you stay towards the center as you open the arms out to the side and you do not get out of the stretch the wrong way
1zqf384lx3m_11-8-rgb_front from here you are going to twist that shoulder and face towards your other side
1zqf384lx3m_12-8-rgb_front take a deep breath on the inhale and as you exhale i want you to twist and press that shoulder into that wall
1zqf384lx3m_13-8-rgb_front get both shoulders even and away from your ears and then slowly twist the waist right back facing that wall
1zqf384lx3m_14-8-rgb_front lift your left arm straight up in the air and slowly float it all the way back down
1zqf384lx3m_15-8-rgb_front you can step away from the wall and you are done
1zqf384lx3m_16-8-rgb_front that was the shoulder wall stretch
1zqf384lx3m_17-8-rgb_front i want to thank you guys for watching today
1zqf384lx3m_18-8-rgb_front i put these stretches together so that you can start to learn about pilates and your body so make sure that you guys get in there and make sure that you stretch correctly
1zqf384lx3m_19-8-rgb_front i want to thank alex and carrie today and base pilates for having me here
1zqf384lx3m_2-8-rgb_front so you are going to start by facing the wall like you are in trouble just kidding
1zqf384lx3m_20-8-rgb_front make sure to see my other videos and i will see you guys soon
1zqf384lx3m_21-8-rgb_front thanks for watching
1zqf384lx3m_3-8-rgb_front you are going to reach your right arm straight up in the air just like alex has here
1zqf384lx3m_4-8-rgb_front from here you are going to open out to the side so you are going to make sure that your shoulder is completely in line
1zqf384lx3m_5-8-rgb_front you do not want it above or below but straight in line with that shoulder and then you are going to slowly start to turn your body out to the left side
1zqf384lx3m_6-8-rgb_front as you are pressing the shoulder down into the wall and you do not have to turn the shoulder very much here but it is a good shoulder to open up that chest
1zqf384lx3m_7-8-rgb_front good take a deep inhale here and try to twist a little bit more as you straighten the body all the way good and then come back to center
1zqf384lx3m_8-8-rgb_front face the wall again and make sure you lift the arms straight up and then lower it right back down to your side
1zqf384lx3m_9-8-rgb_front we are going to switch to the left arms and lift your left arms straight up in the air
1zrg1-tq9uc_0-8-rgb_front so even though we have been doing it in parts already
1zrg1-tq9uc_1-8-rgb_front it is good to reiterate when we are moving along and using specifically with something that has a pattern in it or not
1zrg1-tq9uc_10-8-rgb_front i am just going to cut out a small piece to give you an example
1zrg1-tq9uc_11-8-rgb_front this is a small piece of a darker
1zrg1-tq9uc_12-8-rgb_front so see how that would even if i laid this over it in some area or turned it and laid it in another area
1zrg1-tq9uc_13-8-rgb_front its going to create a value shift
1zrg1-tq9uc_14-8-rgb_front or give a line
1zrg1-tq9uc_15-8-rgb_front or give a crease that much you might try to achieve while you are doing something in drawing
1zrg1-tq9uc_16-8-rgb_front so before i lay stuff down i actually want to kind of play with the values a little bit
1zrg1-tq9uc_2-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that you are paying attention to the value tones
1zrg1-tq9uc_3-8-rgb_front i am trying to create what looks to me as if could possible be a hand a wrist a fingernail a kneecap
1zrg1-tq9uc_4-8-rgb_front i do not want to be thinking this is just a certain area for muddled color and i do not need to be paying attention to those things
1zrg1-tq9uc_5-8-rgb_front so i cut this piece out right for the wrist here
1zrg1-tq9uc_6-8-rgb_front i am looking at though and i am thinking to myself it looks nice i like the color of it
1zrg1-tq9uc_7-8-rgb_front but i do not exactly see any shifts in value that are intriguing to me enough to show that if this is the wrist laying on top of the knee why is not there any value shifts inside of it
1zrg1-tq9uc_8-8-rgb_front so i may actually just lay this piece down but begin to lay some layers over on top of it to have a little more shift in value
1zrg1-tq9uc_9-8-rgb_front such as maybe something out of here
2-2lfoz24he_0-8-rgb_front you know consumer fireworks can add fun and excitement to any holiday event or gathering at parties
2-2lfoz24he_1-8-rgb_front i am captain joe bruni with over three decades of firefighting and emergency medical service experience

2-2lfoz24he_11-8-rgb_front i am captain joe bruni stay safe and we will see you next time
2-2lfoz24he_2-8-rgb_front what we are going to talk about is personal protective equipment when it comes to using common consumer fireworks
2-2lfoz24he_3-8-rgb_front someone designated as the shooter should always be outfitted with a good pair of fitting safety glasses and a good fitting pair of light leather gloves or cloth gloves to avoid burn injuries
2-2lfoz24he_4-8-rgb_front also no open toed shoes or bare feet should be permitted with anyone that is using consumer fireworks or designated as the shooter
2-2lfoz24he_5-8-rgb_front even something as simple as the common sparkler can cause significant burn injuries
2-2lfoz24he_6-8-rgb_front the things like bare feet and unprotected hands
2-2lfoz24he_7-8-rgb_front things like the common sparkler burn at a very high temperature from eleven to eighteen hundred degrees
2-2lfoz24he_8-8-rgb_front common consumer fireworks emit showers of sparks which are very hot
2-2lfoz24he_9-8-rgb_front so it is a good idea to protect not only the user but the person who is a responsible adult designated as the shooter
2-3ddnf8zlk_1-8-rgb_front i am from suite studio
2-3ddnf8zlk_10-8-rgb_front whenever you have a roof with an a shape you want to insulate that in a certain way
2-3ddnf8zlk_11-8-rgb_front you want to insulate the top a frame portion of it and also you want to insulate across your beams that make you re inside ceiling so you have got two layers of insulation in the ceiling
2-3ddnf8zlk_12-8-rgb_front that really helps keep the sound from going up
2-3ddnf8zlk_13-8-rgb_front another consideration is if i do have a cement block wall construction on a cement block slab i have really got to be concerned about my roof because that is where all my sound is going to leak out of
2-3ddnf8zlk_14-8-rgb_front if i build a standard a frame type roof i am going to really want to insulate it and definitely use or construction
2-3ddnf8zlk_2-8-rgb_front i am here to talk to you about soundproofing your recording studio
2-3ddnf8zlk_3-8-rgb_front on this building i have siding on the outside which is a standard cardboard siding that you will find on many homes
2-3ddnf8zlk_4-8-rgb_front it is pretty good for stopping sound but not quite as good as plywood would be
2-3ddnf8zlk_5-8-rgb_front if i were building this home from the ground up or i wanted to make this better i would put over the plywood and then put shingles over that
2-3ddnf8zlk_6-8-rgb_front but i am more concerned with working on the inside of my building and that is where i spent my money for this building was on the inside walls
2-3ddnf8zlk_7-8-rgb_front we are going to go in there and show you a little of that in a moment
2-3ddnf8zlk_8-8-rgb_front the building here is done with a cement slab with two by four construction an a frame ceiling and and a frame roof with shingles on the roof
2-3ddnf8zlk_9-8-rgb_front now that is another problem area we are going to talk about a little bit more
2-5r15afls8_0-8-rgb_front i am going to show you how to make a scrumptious coffee
2-5r15afls8_1-8-rgb_front now what i am going to make here is a single serving but you can also make this in a pan over the stove
2-5r15afls8_10-8-rgb_front also a half an ounce of rum and i am going to stir that up again
2-5r15afls8_11-8-rgb_front i am going to drop in an orange peel and then i am going to let this infuse as i heat it in the microwave for about thirty seconds
2-5r15afls8_12-8-rgb_front once i take it out i am going to top it with whip cream
2-5r15afls8_13-8-rgb_front a little bit of nutmeg just like so
2-5r15afls8_14-8-rgb_front and if you would like to add another orange peel on top feel free to do so
2-5r15afls8_15-8-rgb_front and there you have it a scrumptious coffee
2-5r15afls8_16-8-rgb_front cheers
2-5r15afls8_2-8-rgb_front just make sure that when you heat it you do not bring it to a boil
2-5r15afls8_3-8-rgb_front now if you are going to make an individual serving you can heat this up in the microwave
2-5r15afls8_4-8-rgb_front we are going to start off with a very strong hot cup of coffee and we will add to that some sugar
2-5r15afls8_5-8-rgb_front you can also use brown sugar so that is up to you
2-5r15afls8_6-8-rgb_front and i like my coffee sweet like i like my men so i am going to add whatever that means i am going to add two tablespoons of sugar and then i am going to add in the liquor
2-5r15afls8_7-8-rgb_front we are going to do a half an ounce of brandy just like so
2-5r15afls8_8-8-rgb_front and we are also going to add a half an ounce of dark rum
2-5r15afls8_9-8-rgb_front and if you decide to do this in a larger pot just increase the amount of your liquor as you would increase the amount of your coffee
2-8siqsw9ou_0-8-rgb_front swimming you lie on a comfortable surface
2-8siqsw9ou_1-8-rgb_front you take the arms right out ahead of you and stretch
2-8siqsw9ou_10-8-rgb_front you work yourself into the levels as you inhale and exhale pressing the pelvis right into the floor and reaching like somebody is got you by the fingers and somebody else got you by the toes
2-8siqsw9ou_11-8-rgb_front inhale and exhale
2-8siqsw9ou_12-8-rgb_front keep your shoulders relaxed and just reach
2-8siqsw9ou_13-8-rgb_front and control each movement with the breath as you move stretching the toes and fingers
2-8siqsw9ou_14-8-rgb_front and then just release come down in the resting posture
2-8siqsw9ou_15-8-rgb_front and then guide the floor away from you as you come back up
2-8siqsw9ou_2-8-rgb_front it is like somebody is got you right by the hands you want to stretch those fingers right out
2-8siqsw9ou_3-8-rgb_front what you do is you press the pelvis right in to the floor firmly and lift up your left arm and your right leg
2-8siqsw9ou_4-8-rgb_front some people is down lower other people you can lift up higher
2-8siqsw9ou_5-8-rgb_front you are connecting opposite energies in the body from the left to the right
2-8siqsw9ou_6-8-rgb_front take a deep breath in and then exhale
2-8siqsw9ou_7-8-rgb_front switch the right arm and left leg go higher
2-8siqsw9ou_8-8-rgb_front and then inhale switch
2-8siqsw9ou_9-8-rgb_front again you can be right down here exhale inhale exhale some people just barely touch the floor with it
2-g31cnowcu_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is tim cole i am with the austin reptile service
2-g31cnowcu_1-8-rgb_front and i have been keeping reptiles and amphibians for over forty years
2-g31cnowcu_10-8-rgb_front these are fairly popular lizards and they do make good pets if you set them up properly
2-g31cnowcu_11-8-rgb_front you need to provide uv light you need to supplement their insects with calcium powder you do need to provide a heat source
2-g31cnowcu_12-8-rgb_front and since they are arboreal that is going to mean a heat lamp that they can bask underneath
2-g31cnowcu_2-8-rgb_front i am here to talk to you about keeping chinese water dragons
2-g31cnowcu_3-8-rgb_front these are a medium size lizard average about three feet
2-g31cnowcu_4-8-rgb_front they are green with a crest going down the back
2-g31cnowcu_5-8-rgb_front looks somewhat similar to the iguana but a little bit heavier body and usually a lot friendlier
2-g31cnowcu_6-8-rgb_front these lizards are arboreal so they are climbers so you will want to set them up in a vertical cage
2-g31cnowcu_7-8-rgb_front they do need a lot of humidity so if you can set up a misting system or spray them yourselves manually on a daily basis that would be good
2-g31cnowcu_8-8-rgb_front these lizards are usually feeding on crickets when they are young they will also eat small fish
2-g31cnowcu_9-8-rgb_front as they get older they will eat larger fish adult crickets and even small rodents including mice
2-jvo5scscc_0-8-rgb_front some other points finer points i want to make about adjustable seating and cushioning for people with disabilities is again i want to make the point that if you are helping somebody with a spinal cord injury to really make sure the seating is as comfortable as possible
2-jvo5scscc_1-8-rgb_front you or i who might not have a spinal cord injury can usually ourselves in our canoe seats as often as possible
2-jvo5scscc_10-8-rgb_front again look at a participant is wheelchair
2-jvo5scscc_11-8-rgb_front some participants use manual wheelchairs
2-jvo5scscc_12-8-rgb_front maybe they have a lower level spinal cord injury in which case maybe the patio chair is great for them
2-jvo5scscc_13-8-rgb_front maybe there might be other people that use a power wheelchair that usually has a higher back and needs a little bit more support so maybe the chosen valley canoe seat would be great for them
2-jvo5scscc_14-8-rgb_front again just look at their wheelchairs and sort of assess what sort of cushioning and back support their need and then also ask your participant what kind of support do you need
2-jvo5scscc_15-8-rgb_front it is very respectful to ask that question and a lot of times the participants they have been in similar situations before and so they know what is what works best for them
2-jvo5scscc_16-8-rgb_front so just always you know ask questions and assess based off of systems that are already set up in place
2-jvo5scscc_2-8-rgb_front sometimes if you are ever sitting at a desk you will notice yourself shifting around a lot
2-jvo5scscc_3-8-rgb_front that is because we are trying to aleve pressure sores
2-jvo5scscc_4-8-rgb_front however people with spinal cord injuries do not always feel that they need to readjust themselves to aleve those press pressure sores
2-jvo5scscc_5-8-rgb_front so what i like to do is if somebody is coming canoeing with me that ha that is in a wheelchair i always like to look at their wheelchair and ask them what is what kind of cushioning support do you need
2-jvo5scscc_6-8-rgb_front always ask your participant
2-jvo5scscc_7-8-rgb_front it is not rude to ask
2-jvo5scscc_8-8-rgb_front it is very respectful and it gives you a good insight as to the needs that they will need for canoeing or rafting or just sort of any type of adaptable equipment
2-jvo5scscc_9-8-rgb_front so always look at their cushioning and all also for as far as back support whether you are going to need the patio chair or the chosen valley chair
2-c2l2jnrbu_0-8-rgb_front on this clip i want to talk about grids grids are a light modifier if you look at that see how it kind of disappears when i turn that
2-c2l2jnrbu_1-8-rgb_front they do the same thing to the light
2-c2l2jnrbu_10-8-rgb_front the problem is your modeling lights will cause them to burn so you have to be really really careful you cannot leave your modeling light on a long amount of time if you make your own
2-c2l2jnrbu_11-8-rgb_front these are all kind of specific to the size of your reflector they just snap in on the speedtron on the photogenics they actually have a little clip a little spring loaded clip that holds them in
2-c2l2jnrbu_12-8-rgb_front and they work real well they will last you a lifetime you cannot drop anything on it because it will smash the little honeycombs that is inside
2-c2l2jnrbu_13-8-rgb_front if they get to where they are spilling light a little bit too much you can come in with flat black paint and spray them and it will keep the reflection off from spilling where you do not want it
2-c2l2jnrbu_2-8-rgb_front the light shines through let me get this turned on light shines through and when it is not on there it gives a broad light dispersion
2-c2l2jnrbu_3-8-rgb_front as you can see as i put this on it narrows the beam down considerably
2-c2l2jnrbu_4-8-rgb_front it actually just funnels the light down to a smaller beam
2-c2l2jnrbu_5-8-rgb_front grids are a couple of different sizes i do not know if you can see this as you can see this one has much finer holes in it than this one this one narrows the beam even more
2-c2l2jnrbu_6-8-rgb_front this one is a little coarser and allows a little more
2-c2l2jnrbu_7-8-rgb_front this is very very important when you are trying to do very fine detailed lighting because it allows you to put light exactly where you need it
2-c2l2jnrbu_8-8-rgb_front these are amazing little things
2-c2l2jnrbu_9-8-rgb_front you can make some of these out of cardboard by cutting cardboard sidewards and then like putting a rubber band or something around them
2-cwdidthti_0-8-rgb_front if you were to take a look at your teeth underneath a microscope the enamel of your tooth even though it is the hardest substance in our bodies it is still pretty porous
2-cwdidthti_1-8-rgb_front and what happens is that those porous areas are the ones that we are utilizing to whiten our teeth
2-cwdidthti_10-8-rgb_front many of the tooth whiteners that you are purchasing in stores the grocery stores and the supermarkets and department stores have a lower concentration of that peroxide
2-cwdidthti_11-8-rgb_front so it may take you longer to get to your results and you will have to be a little bit more patient versus the or in professional store whitening where you have a higher concentration of that peroxide
2-cwdidthti_12-8-rgb_front so you are getting much more whitening in a shorter period of time
2-cwdidthti_2-8-rgb_front so here is what happens
2-cwdidthti_3-8-rgb_front you have a very porous tooth structure and onto that tooth structure you put one of the whitening agents on there
2-cwdidthti_4-8-rgb_front usually the whitening agents are made of a hydrogen peroxide or a carbamide peroxide
2-cwdidthti_5-8-rgb_front it is not really truly bleach as some people are led to believe
2-cwdidthti_6-8-rgb_front so it is a hydrogen peroxide and when you put that up against the structure of the enamel all of those porous areas from those areas you are pulling and drawing stain out from the tooth
2-cwdidthti_7-8-rgb_front and so during that time that you are sitting with that whitening agent on teeth you are actually pulling and drawing stain out
2-cwdidthti_8-8-rgb_front the longer period of time you are sitting with that whitener up against the tooth the more whitening that is existing during that time
2-cwdidthti_9-8-rgb_front also of course we need to consider the strength of the tooth whitener
2-hvu0ydlry_0-8-rgb_front torso twist with buddha arms and elbows extended
2-hvu0ydlry_1-8-rgb_front no meditation just a fancy name to give you a visual of what the arms are going to do
2-hvu0ydlry_10-8-rgb_front now the arms are going to go in front of you
2-hvu0ydlry_11-8-rgb_front the hands in front of the chest and the elbows out
2-hvu0ydlry_12-8-rgb_front you are going to press into the hands like you are fighting
2-hvu0ydlry_13-8-rgb_front like you are having a match here with the hands that is going to keep nice tension all throughout the upper body
2-hvu0ydlry_14-8-rgb_front as you twist keep the hands in front do not let them go ahead
2-hvu0ydlry_15-8-rgb_front that is a very common thing to do when you are not familiar with the exercise
2-hvu0ydlry_16-8-rgb_front keeping the hips facing forward if you notice my belly button is still facing the same way as i am twisting
2-hvu0ydlry_17-8-rgb_front play with the breathing inhale exhale
2-hvu0ydlry_18-8-rgb_front now instead of looking down i am looking at my hands right now to make sure you want to do that but also keep the gaze forward
2-hvu0ydlry_19-8-rgb_front so you want to make sure that you keep the hands in front maybe kind of look at them without lowering your chin
2-hvu0ydlry_2-8-rgb_front but the torso twist is a great way to train your middle the middle of your body
2-hvu0ydlry_20-8-rgb_front do a few of these and before you know it you are going to have a nice strong core
2-hvu0ydlry_21-8-rgb_front nice middle section and same with the back and it is going to make a difference in the way you feel and the way you look so good luck to you
2-hvu0ydlry_3-8-rgb_front start training your obliques and same with the back and the middle area
2-hvu0ydlry_4-8-rgb_front so when you when your stance just like i am right now
2-hvu0ydlry_5-8-rgb_front you want your feet about shoulder width toes slightly out
2-hvu0ydlry_6-8-rgb_front when you bend your knees make sure that you keep your hips underneath the shoulders that they are not pushed forward like this
2-hvu0ydlry_7_8-8-rgb_front so check in the mirror make sure that you are not ahead out of alignment you are going to tuck your hips and that is what is tricky is tucking this way so you feel like almost like somebody is pulling you from the front of the pants or you are looking at a caught zipper or something here and that is what you do when you do that
2-hvu0ydlry_9-8-rgb_front so keeping that bringing the belly in by getting that vacuum in and shoulders down
2-u7jirumzo_0-8-rgb_front you know the consumer type of firework can be a lot of fun to any holiday or party event
2-u7jirumzo_1-8-rgb_front hi i am captain joe bruni with over three decades of firefighting and emergency medical service experience
2-u7jirumzo_2-8-rgb_front the one type of consumer firework that seems to be the most common in the united states is the sparkler
2-u7jirumzo_3-8-rgb_front sparklers are found across the united states during holiday and party events
2-u7jirumzo_4-8-rgb_front when sparklers are used they can reach eleven hundred to eighteen hundred degrees that is a very hot item
2-u7jirumzo_5-8-rgb_front so ensure any time sparklers are used that they are used somewhere in an open area closely supervised by an adult and kept away from any flammable or combustible product
2-u7jirumzo_6-8-rgb_front things such as leaves dried grass also can create a problem even in the open area with the sparklers shower of sparks and heat
2-u7jirumzo_7-8-rgb_front so remember anytime sparklers are being used use them in an open wide area far away from any type of combustible or flammable product
2-u7jirumzo_8-8-rgb_front it may also be a good idea to keep some type of bucket of water or fire extinguisher handy just in case there is a problem related to fire
2-u7jirumzo_9-8-rgb_front i am captain joe bruni stay safe and we will see you next time
2-vvtaca76o_10-8-rgb_front some white is going to also be injected to get some gray tones going on especially towards the top here
2-vvtaca76o_11-8-rgb_front this is going to make the clothing a little more interesting
2-vvtaca76o_12-8-rgb_front this is actually somewhat of what our subject is wearing too
2-vvtaca76o_13-8-rgb_front keep in mind the first layer is going to be the closest to our portrait before we then veer off into some interesting alternative directions
2-vvtaca76o_3-8-rgb_front also using media to keep this layer thinner
2-vvtaca76o_4-8-rgb_front we are going to be bring this down and around the fingers here and what we are really doing is establishing tone
2-vvtaca76o_5-8-rgb_front the actual colors are going to be darker than this but i greatly prefer putting some of the darker elements over the lighter ones in this case with clothing
2-vvtaca76o_6-8-rgb_front another thing is we are going to have the collars and everything here be blue but they are going to be some black regions in the middle here
2-vvtaca76o_7-8-rgb_front so get a second flat brush flat head here and some black and we will start putting this on in here
2-vvtaca76o_8-8-rgb_front lots of medium very very thin coat here
2-vvtaca76o_9-8-rgb_front very thin
2-vxo7mmljc_0-5-rgb_front hi
2-vxo7mmljc_1-5-rgb_front i am kelli
2-vxo7mmljc_10-5-rgb_front we are just going to use our concealer brush and just kind of pat it on any areas of concern any areas that we want a little bit more coverage on
2-vxo7mmljc_11-5-rgb_front of course a little bit on the eye area
2-vxo7mmljc_12-5-rgb_front i like to use a brush because it blends it a lot better than say a sponge or even your fingers
2-vxo7mmljc_13-5-rgb_front that just gave us a little bit of extra help just covering up any little blemishes or anything like that under the eye area
2-vxo7mmljc_14-5-rgb_front that is how you would want to use a concealer when you are trying to achieve a perfect canvas look
2-vxo7mmljc_3-5-rgb_front now that we have evened out her complexion with a foundation we are going to go back and cover up any little areas that may need a little bit more coverage
2-vxo7mmljc_4-5-rgb_front that is why i like to conceal after i have done my foundation because foundation will give you some coverage but is not necessarily made to give you a ton of coverage on little blemishes or anything like that
2-vxo7mmljc_5-5-rgb_front i like to conceal afterwards because i like to see what kind of coverage i can get out of foundation first
2-vxo7mmljc_6-5-rgb_front it is kind of unnecessary to put on a ton of makeup if you do not need it if your foundation will do the job for you
2-vxo7mmljc_7-5-rgb_front also if you do you a little bit of concealer after your foundation it is going to stay on a lot better for you
2-vxo7mmljc_8-5-rgb_front what happens a lot of times is when you apply your concealer before your foundation it will have kind of a tendency to be wiped off as you are applying your foundation
2-vxo7mmljc_9-5-rgb_front applying afterwards will give you a little bit better coverage and keep your foundation on a little bit longer for you
2-zlrjxloga_0-8-rgb_front do not ask do not tell is pretty good advice
2-zlrjxloga_1-8-rgb_front how do you ask a coworker out on a date
2-zlrjxloga_10-8-rgb_front i do not want anyone to be aware of this at work it is nobody is business but yours and mine and so if you feel the same way and you would like to see me then i would like to see you but i do not want anyone at the office to be aware of this
2-zlrjxloga_11-8-rgb_front okay
2-zlrjxloga_12-8-rgb_front so when i said do not ask do not tell that is exactly what it is
2-zlrjxloga_13-8-rgb_front and you have to have a commitment both of you to not have anything stated
2-zlrjxloga_14-8-rgb_front if the other says well i really do not feel comfortable with that i do not date people at work that is it
2-zlrjxloga_15-8-rgb_front never go there again
2-zlrjxloga_17-8-rgb_front get the cell phone get the whatever it may be and then proceed communicating from there
2-zlrjxloga_18-8-rgb_front do not do the at work do not do the cell phone at work keep that distinctly apart from whatever is going to occur on the outside
2-zlrjxloga_2-8-rgb_front this is doctor paul author of boomer girls a boomer woman is guide to men and dating and host of ask doctor paul
2-zlrjxloga_3-8-rgb_front many companies have a no fraternization policy that means they are not interested in you dating within the company because it can cause problems
2-zlrjxloga_4-8-rgb_front now how enforcible is that i am not certain
2-zlrjxloga_5-8-rgb_front i am not certain that hr knows but i know that if an issue comes up that may be used
2-zlrjxloga_6-8-rgb_front the best advice is do not ask do not tell take it outside
2-zlrjxloga_7-8-rgb_front if you find someone that you feel you are interested in dating at the office say to that person i would like to meet you for coffee that is easy to chat about a few things after work at this restaurant
2-zlrjxloga_8-8-rgb_front do not make it a bar it is too close
2-zlrjxloga_9-8-rgb_front go to the restaurant and say look i am interested in you be it male or female and say i would like to get to know you better
204pffncqbc_0-8-rgb_front you may have been waiting for when i was going to start talking about swiss manufactured clocks
204pffncqbc_1-8-rgb_front the fact is the swiss did not really make that many clocks
204pffncqbc_10-8-rgb_front so there are swiss clocks not that many of them
204pffncqbc_11-8-rgb_front but a much larger category of swiss clocks actually were small clocks that were more similar to watches in construction and size than they were to clocks
204pffncqbc_12-8-rgb_front this is a travel clock probably from the made in switzerland but it really is just a large pocket watch essentially that is built in to a folding case
204pffncqbc_13-8-rgb_front so these are often in leather sometimes in silver but probably the bulk of swiss would be in small clocks like this
204pffncqbc_2-8-rgb_front they are much more famous for their watch making industry
204pffncqbc_3-8-rgb_front so i am often asked well how bout switzerland
204pffncqbc_4-8-rgb_front you know where is all the swiss clocks
204pffncqbc_5-8-rgb_front again not many of them
204pffncqbc_6-8-rgb_front they did make this style of clock called the neuchatel clock it goes back to the seventeen hundreds but they actually still make reproductions of them today
204pffncqbc_7-8-rgb_front this is a form of bracket clock
204pffncqbc_8-8-rgb_front so when we were talking about bracket clocks before you would know that underneath this would have been a similarly painted shelf or bracket that the clock would sit on
204pffncqbc_9-8-rgb_front and when you buy the reproductions now is switzerland perhaps they always come with that same bracket with the same floral paintings and things going on there as well
20okhuzd7hi_0-5-rgb_front now with anything practice makes perfect
20okhuzd7hi_1-5-rgb_front my cotton candy cone did not look like this on my first try
20okhuzd7hi_2-5-rgb_front it probably looked something more like this and it just flops off the cone
20okhuzd7hi_3-5-rgb_front so it is really hard at first you have to get the hang of it
20okhuzd7hi_4-5-rgb_front but before your event plan ahead and make sure that you know what you are doing
20okhuzd7hi_5-5-rgb_front allow at least minutes to make sure you know what you are doing
20okhuzd7hi_6-5-rgb_front and if you are really having trouble getting the cotton candy to stick to the cone you can try using a damp cloth and just rub it right over the cone and it will stick right on there
20efgtwq9-i_0-8-rgb_front here are the pots and utensils we are going to need today
20efgtwq9-i_1-8-rgb_front we are going to need a sautã pan or a frying pan
20efgtwq9-i_10-8-rgb_front we are to be using this to keep the seeds out of here
20efgtwq9-i_11-8-rgb_front we are going to be roasting our vegetables in this pan
20efgtwq9-i_12-8-rgb_front we are going to be using another one of these little containers in that we are going to make our butter and put that in to the freezer
20efgtwq9-i_13_14-8-rgb_front we are using three bowls here we are going to be putting flour in one bread crumbs in another and then making an egg wash we are going to be needing a knife a spoon a peeler some measuring spoons cutting board and because we are using chicken we are going to be using these gloves
20efgtwq9-i_2-8-rgb_front we are going to be cooking our chicken in here but not all the way through
20efgtwq9-i_3-8-rgb_front later after we sear it closed we are going to put it on a baking sheet and finish it in the oven
20efgtwq9-i_4-8-rgb_front we are actually are going to be using two baking sheets today because one we are going to start off by cooking our bacon that will later go in with our potatoes
20efgtwq9-i_5-8-rgb_front we are going to be boiling our potatoes in here and that is why we will have this strainer
20efgtwq9-i_6-8-rgb_front we are going to let them cool cut them and then we are going to mix them with our bacon and our parmesan cheese
20efgtwq9-i_7-8-rgb_front we are going to be boiling our carrots and asparagus before we go ahead and roast them
20efgtwq9-i_8-8-rgb_front and i have another strainer here because we are going to be soaking our artichoke hearts in lemon juice
20efgtwq9-i_9-8-rgb_front so we are going to put our artichoke hearts in here and we are going to squeeze our lemon right over the top
20oosjixdyg_0-8-rgb_front this cocktail is called boat drink

20qfsdfd3io_0-8-rgb_front calab labarda oh hi
20qfsdfd3io_1-8-rgb_front my name is calab labarda i am a third degree black belt in taekwondo
20qfsdfd3io_10-8-rgb_front you can use it just cut those off with a saw okay
20qfsdfd3io_11-8-rgb_front also these ones are more hardcore okay
20qfsdfd3io_12-8-rgb_front you want to be pretty good with nunchucks before you even move on to these ones cause they will knock you out alright
20qfsdfd3io_13-8-rgb_front so when you are first starting out you want to go ahead and use some soft full nunchucks like these ones okay
20qfsdfd3io_23-8-rgb_front now the difference between that and your regular nunchuck okay look at the string length okay
20qfsdfd3io_24-8-rgb_front these are going to be a lot faster and a lot quicker
20qfsdfd3io_25-8-rgb_front these are going to be little bit slower but it delivers more of a umph okay
20qfsdfd3io_26-8-rgb_front this is more of the whip okay
20qfsdfd3io_27-8-rgb_front they are still both realistic
20qfsdfd3io_28-8-rgb_front they can use for fighting and they are both very strong
20qfsdfd3io_29-8-rgb_front but this one will deliver a fast whip okay
20qfsdfd3io_3-8-rgb_front alright so now i am going to be showing you different types of nunchucks okay
20qfsdfd3io_30-8-rgb_front they are delivered for fast strikes very quickly okay
20qfsdfd3io_31-8-rgb_front now the kind i am going to be using today are the full length professional nunchucks okay
20qfsdfd3io_32-8-rgb_front you can just order these online or wherever you find them
20qfsdfd3io_33-8-rgb_front i would like to test my nunchucks out before i use them and this is the best pair that i found
20qfsdfd3io_34-8-rgb_front they are weighted there is pins in them and you can see this is where you hold them they are weighted okay
20qfsdfd3io_35-8-rgb_front the string is one long okay
20qfsdfd3io_36-8-rgb_front and you can see the stick this is maple wood
20qfsdfd3io_37-8-rgb_front it is very strong nunchuck
20qfsdfd3io_38-8-rgb_front it is very realistic
20qfsdfd3io_39-8-rgb_front it is the real thing
20qfsdfd3io_4-8-rgb_front this pair right here that i have with me are hard bruce lee styled nunchucks okay
20qfsdfd3io_40-8-rgb_front i can put it on my back pocket and use it as a weapon
20qfsdfd3io_5-8-rgb_front like i said before these right here these little fancy shiny pins in em they are just for looks make them look fancy and shiny when you spin it around to give it some flair okay
20qfsdfd3io_6-8-rgb_front it has a chain with it okay
20qfsdfd3io_7-8-rgb_front if ever you used the chain nunchuck make sure it is the length of your hand okay
20qfsdfd3io_8-8-rgb_front that is how you pick out a good nunchuck
20qfsdfd3io_9-8-rgb_front okay you could see right here that two links have been removed
20xez8y80ri_0-8-rgb_front ok we are in the process now where tiffany is hair is actually starting to lighten
20xez8y80ri_1-8-rgb_front if you can do a mental picture of what a hair color chart would look like where we started her hair color was somewhere in the golden tones
20xez8y80ri_2-8-rgb_front we want to get her to a little bit of a blonder stage so you actually have to lighten through these stages of color until you get to the blond where you want to be
20xez8y80ri_3-8-rgb_front the biggest mistake people make is they see this orange and they rinse it off
20xez8y80ri_4-8-rgb_front you need to process through that color
20xez8y80ri_5-8-rgb_front get all the way you want we are working toward the blondest to a blonder shade so do not stop at the orange stage
20xez8y80ri_6-8-rgb_front how you would do that is you want to check
20xez8y80ri_7-8-rgb_front we can actually see the hair lightening and it works from where we processed it first the very underneath
20xez8y80ri_8-8-rgb_front i am going to clip some hair out of the way so i can show you what i am talking about and we are going to see this section of hair where it is actually lightened
20xez8y80ri_9-8-rgb_front you want to take a color excuse me a water bottle and you we are going to clean this off and i will show you how this is lightened on this section of hair
2188ltsfiv8_1-8-rgb_front so for starters i am going to show you all what we need
2188ltsfiv8_10-8-rgb_front here i have got onion and garlic tomatoes that is just going to make everything taste better
2188ltsfiv8_11-8-rgb_front i guess will get started
2188ltsfiv8_12-8-rgb_front oh and by the way we have a mixing bowl here because you may need one of those
2188ltsfiv8_2-8-rgb_front i have got a plate of boneless skinless chicken breast here the frozen kind so i let them defrost
2188ltsfiv8_3-8-rgb_front i have got a large onion a medium size green bell pepper i have got pepper some butter and i have got a brush so you can brush our casserole dish right here our casserole dish with a little butter
2188ltsfiv8_4-8-rgb_front we have got a package which is regular ranch salad dressing
2188ltsfiv8_5-8-rgb_front we have got some garlic powder some adobe seasoning a little hot sauce some salt
2188ltsfiv8_6-8-rgb_front let is see we have got flour tortillas the jumbo kind mozzarella cheese and a fiesta blend cheese or you could use
2188ltsfiv8_7-8-rgb_front i have got some oil here so we cook our chicken in our skillet
2188ltsfiv8_8-8-rgb_front i have got some just regular tomato salsa
2188ltsfiv8_9-8-rgb_front now the thing is you really want to use a whole jar of this but if your short like i am you can just use a can of tomatoes and just grind it up in your food processor
218kpyi1x7k_1-8-rgb_front today going to make shrimp and scallop fettucini with a side of garlic bread
218kpyi1x7k_10-8-rgb_front but this is such a great medium for it you know to put it into a broth type of thing or a sauce
218kpyi1x7k_11-8-rgb_front and they just cook really gently in there and just going to be so tender and sweet along with the shrimp and all your other vegetables and spices and things that just going to love this
218kpyi1x7k_2-8-rgb_front okay now got our seafood cut up we have some beautiful gulf shrimp just just about the perfect size for this for me you can use some really large ones if you like
218kpyi1x7k_3-8-rgb_front got the great scallops again you can go ahead and just use the little scallops too the bay scallops which are like hundreds to the pound but i like this for texture
218kpyi1x7k_4-8-rgb_front got a great sauce going so how we are going to add this
218kpyi1x7k_5-8-rgb_front we have our beautiful shrimp just grab your spoon and push it right in here and going to see as they say they have a thermometer because this is what going to show you going to turn pink after about two to three minutes depending on how high your heat is
218kpyi1x7k_6-8-rgb_front i like a nice simmer to put this in because you really want to overcook these
218kpyi1x7k_7-8-rgb_front and then go ahead and grab your scallops as many as you like and just add those to the pan too
218kpyi1x7k_8-8-rgb_front see how beautifully white they are
218kpyi1x7k_9-8-rgb_front going to become opaque and again you want to overcook scallops either because they become tough
21bhzn_li1s_0-5-rgb_front so let is talk about bedroom furniture
21bhzn_li1s_1-5-rgb_front in the bedroom there are different things that go in the bedroom
21bhzn_li1s_10-5-rgb_front you can have a wide mirror like this again for you wide people
21bhzn_li1s_11-5-rgb_front you can have a mirror that is wide you can have a tall mirror
21bhzn_li1s_12-5-rgb_front besides the dressers they also carry chests
21bhzn_li1s_13-5-rgb_front the chest again is designed for your whites your socks your pants and different things
21bhzn_li1s_14-5-rgb_front again they use this again for spacing
21bhzn_li1s_15-5-rgb_front if you do not have the space go with the dressers
21bhzn_li1s_16-5-rgb_front it is a nice piece again to use that because you have got to be able to put your clothes away
21bhzn_li1s_17-5-rgb_front besides the chest you have night stands which are to this side over here
21bhzn_li1s_18-5-rgb_front the night stands are a smaller piece
21bhzn_li1s_19-5-rgb_front again designed to put your to put a lamp
21bhzn_li1s_2-5-rgb_front you can put a dresser which is the long dresser
21bhzn_li1s_20-5-rgb_front so you can see at night to read a book
21bhzn_li1s_21-5-rgb_front you can actually put again your whites and different things in there
21bhzn_li1s_3-5-rgb_front a dresser is used to put your whites your your pants
21bhzn_li1s_4-5-rgb_front do not put anything to heavy because the drawers again are not designed to put anything that heavy
21bhzn_li1s_5-5-rgb_front but the dressers design again is to hold accessory pieces to make it look good
21bhzn_li1s_6-5-rgb_front designed to put your perfumes colognes
21bhzn_li1s_7-5-rgb_front you also with the dresser can put a mirror
21bhzn_li1s_8-5-rgb_front if you like that mirror to see yourself to see how good looking you are in the mirror
21bhzn_li1s_9-5-rgb_front so you have the mirror here design
21cvg25d34a_7-5-rgb_front the easier the leg moves the more comfortable the dog will be
21cvg25d34a_8-5-rgb_front sometimes they will be comfortable enough to lay down in the middle of the process
21cvg25d34a_9-5-rgb_front sometimes it is easier actually to start this massage with the animal in the laying down position then he can just relax while you are doing it
21gumyj5buw_0-5-rgb_front my name is pete bailey skyline thinning company
21gumyj5buw_1-5-rgb_front i own and operate the company
21gumyj5buw_13-5-rgb_front and so i take the safety end of it as very good the way we are training our own people
21gumyj5buw_2-5-rgb_front i say we have got a pretty good program set up with our company because thinning it is hard to train someone new because they are really like the choker fetter days are kind of over
21gumyj5buw_3-5-rgb_front and it is so specialized that i can come up with a helper job for the hook tender
21gumyj5buw_4-5-rgb_front the hook tender he is setting up all the roads
21po7gjnq9s_1-5-rgb_front but you will need to take that count and a good rule of thumb for a party is like this is to double the amount of people that have confirmed so anyone that has said hey i am coming i am bringing two friends
21po7gjnq9s_2-5-rgb_front so there is three people and you are going to want to count them as six people instead of just the three and that way it will give you a good idea of how many drinks to have and how many plates and napkins and cups and how much food so if you plan that way then it will be great
21pbs6wnhty_0-5-rgb_front hi
21pbs6wnhty_10-5-rgb_front and you kind of have to play with this a little bit to get it perfect
21pbs6wnhty_11-5-rgb_front so you kind of push down the fabric on the top pin that in place and then come around to the front and look at how it looks
21pbs6wnhty_12-5-rgb_front and this will determine how much more you need to push it in to place
21pbs6wnhty_13-5-rgb_front and the whole point is you want to line up the fabric so that they both meet in the center but that they are equal distances apart
21pbs6wnhty_14-5-rgb_front so in this case the bottom is a little bit too far out
21pbs6wnhty_15-5-rgb_front so we are going to take it in a little bit
21pbs6wnhty_2-5-rgb_front so in this clip we are going to take our bound button hole and we are going to be pressing on the wrong side as well as pinning it
21pbs6wnhty_3-5-rgb_front so once you turn it inside out it looks like this
21pbs6wnhty_4-5-rgb_front and now what we are going to do is press it
21pbs6wnhty_5-5-rgb_front go ahead and take your iron and you just want to press it kind of flat
21pbs6wnhty_6-5-rgb_front get out any crinkles
21pbs6wnhty_7-5-rgb_front so now what you are going to be doing is pushing the fabric inward a little bit so that both the top and the bottom are even
21pbs6wnhty_8-5-rgb_front so turn it to the wrong side and just fold up the fabric just a little
21pbs6wnhty_9-5-rgb_front and you want to take some pins and go ahead and pin it in please
21mlnyovkke_1_2-5-rgb_front so you are probably wondering what does that mean when you see a booth in a mall and you see those bags that look just like every other high fashion ten thousand dollar bags and you are like wow
21mlnyovkke_3-5-rgb_front this bag is only fifty dollars
21mlnyovkke_4-5-rgb_front i can buy it right now and it will look just like theirs
21mlnyovkke_5-5-rgb_front well the truth is it really does not and you can tell the difference and you do not want to buy the bag from the center booth because it is copying the other designers
21mlnyovkke_6-5-rgb_front you can buy a bag just as nice as the bags that are really expensive over at like a medium retailer department store that is only fifty dollars and you are not copying anything
21mlnyovkke_7_8_9-5-rgb_front there are denim bags there are anything you do not have to buy fake bags you do not because there are always other options
21qql15luny_1-5-rgb_front one of the things is that people think that you have to keep your dog on the same side at all times
21qql15luny_2-5-rgb_front this is not true
21qql15luny_3-5-rgb_front i have i walk several dogs at a time and i can mix them up any way i want and change who walks next to who and however i want to do it because i am the pack leader and i get to decide what it is i want to do with the dogs
21qql15luny_4-5-rgb_front also the dog is head can go past your leg but if his shoulders are getting past your leg when you are walking then he is too far ahead and he is going to start feeling like he is leading you he is leading you and he is in charge
21qql15luny_5-5-rgb_front and the important thing to know is that in a pack of dogs there is only one pack leader and everybody else is a follower
21qql15luny_6-5-rgb_front so if he is ahead of you then your the follower and that is not what we want
21qql15luny_7-5-rgb_front we want them to obey us and be submissive to us
21qql15luny_8-5-rgb_front and so we need to be where we are always in front
220uyysxz5u_1-5-rgb_front now we are ready to go ahead and give our best at the tryout
220uyysxz5u_10-5-rgb_front you are going to do your stunts together jump separate and tumble separate
220uyysxz5u_11-5-rgb_front usually you are going to start out with the cheer
220uyysxz5u_12-5-rgb_front when you go into the room you need to be prepared to answer questions
220uyysxz5u_13-5-rgb_front things we talked about earlier your coach may ask you why are you here
220uyysxz5u_14-5-rgb_front why do want to cheer
220uyysxz5u_15-5-rgb_front you need to be confident
220uyysxz5u_16-5-rgb_front you need to be able to deliver your answer
220uyysxz5u_17-5-rgb_front you also just need to make sure that you are friendly because you are going to be spending a lot of time with these coaches these captains
220uyysxz5u_18-5-rgb_front and you just want to be a person that other people want to be around
220uyysxz5u_19-5-rgb_front you are also going to be an active role model for your school
220uyysxz5u_2-5-rgb_front now you are usually only going to be in the room for about five minutes so you have to make sure to give it your all
220uyysxz5u_3-5-rgb_front once you are ready to go in you will be given a number by the judges
220uyysxz5u_31-5-rgb_front it is better to go ahead and show the coach that you can do them than not to try it at all
220uyysxz5u_32-5-rgb_front so now that we have performed we definitely want to say thank you on our way out our time it up and clear the floor for someone else is turn to go ahead
220uyysxz5u_4-5-rgb_front you need to make sure you have this number tightly secured it also needs to be visible
220uyysxz5u_5-5-rgb_front safety pins are an ok way to get it on
220uyysxz5u_6-5-rgb_front so it tape
220uyysxz5u_7-5-rgb_front you just do not want it to fall off because this is how the judges are going to be able to give you your score
220uyysxz5u_8-5-rgb_front you are usually going to be put in a group of about three girls
220uyysxz5u_9-5-rgb_front you are going to do the cheer together
221le0vxcb8_0-8-rgb_front i am dr joe neely
221le0vxcb8_1-8-rgb_front i practice with the barton oaks dental group
221le0vxcb8_10-8-rgb_front the second alternative to dentures would be to put an implant a root tooth substitute in the bone put a ball attachment on top of it put the female portion of the ball attachment into a denture and then have that denture snap into place to where now the denture is supported actually by the bone
221le0vxcb8_11-8-rgb_front the other two anchors that are here
221le0vxcb8_12-8-rgb_front the only other alternative to dentures is nothing
221le0vxcb8_13-8-rgb_front simply wearing nothing for teeth at all
221le0vxcb8_2-8-rgb_front we are going to talk about what the alternatives to dentures are
221le0vxcb8_3-8-rgb_front the three alternatives to wearing removable dentures would be first to do a bridge to use the teeth on either side of the missing teeth to support a single unit that bridges the gap between those teeth depending on the size of the teeth on either side of the missing teeth
221le0vxcb8_4-8-rgb_front sometimes one tooth on either side is adequate or the teeth are very small which in this case they are
221le0vxcb8_5-8-rgb_front it would be necessary to have support from a couple of different teeth
221le0vxcb8_6-8-rgb_front if you can think of the fact that once this is in place these four teeth right here will do the work of six
221le0vxcb8_7-8-rgb_front if you were to go all the way from cuspid to cuspid these two teeth could probably do the work of six
221le0vxcb8_8-8-rgb_front but it is very unlikely that these two small teeth here could do the work of four
221le0vxcb8_9-8-rgb_front so that is a fixed bridge
22bmezr4eok_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to learn how to make gourmet coffee in your home
22bmezr4eok_10-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that you are in a container and then just put it in an area that is going to be roughly at household temperature around degrees
22bmezr4eok_11-5-rgb_front you can leave it there
22bmezr4eok_12-5-rgb_front i would suggest having coffee for more than two weeks after it is opened
22bmezr4eok_13-5-rgb_front if you buy these already sealed bags of the whole beans you are going to be fine for keeping that for a while
22bmezr4eok_14-5-rgb_front but once you opened it that is when you need to be careful about how long you let it sit on your shelf
22bmezr4eok_2-5-rgb_front in this clip i am going to tell you a little bit about saving coffee and what is going to make your coffee taste best
22bmezr4eok_3-5-rgb_front when you buy it normally buy it whole bean
22bmezr4eok_4-5-rgb_front do not go for the already preground stuff
22bmezr4eok_5-5-rgb_front you can get that if you are going to a coffee shop or even if you buy a grinder that is going to be your best bet like for that
22bmezr4eok_6-5-rgb_front so then you can bring it home grind it yourself so you are going to have that taste
22bmezr4eok_7-5-rgb_front also when you buy it do not store it out in just anywhere especially the freezer
22bmezr4eok_8-5-rgb_front that is going to create moisture in the coffee bean and it is going to dry it out
22bmezr4eok_9-5-rgb_front you do not want to leave that out though to open air
22oyldvzi6c_0-5-rgb_front what i will be demonstrating here is bicep incline dumbbell curls
22oyldvzi6c_1-5-rgb_front and what you are going to do is put your bench on an incline
22oyldvzi6c_10-5-rgb_front you want to keep doing about three to about eight ten to reps and if you wanted to you can switch it up and you can do hammers inclined dumbbell curls
22oyldvzi6c_2-5-rgb_front and then pretty much doing the same thing that you would do if you were standing or sitting as curling the dumbbell
22oyldvzi6c_3-5-rgb_front still giving it a good flex of the bicep when you bring it up
22oyldvzi6c_4-5-rgb_front flex it
22oyldvzi6c_5-5-rgb_front this action is a little harder only because you are at an incline
22oyldvzi6c_6-5-rgb_front so when you bring it down you still want to control the weight
22oyldvzi6c_7-5-rgb_front because you are at an incline that weight is kind of forcing itself down a little faster
22oyldvzi6c_8-5-rgb_front when you bring it up again you want to keep putting tension on that bicep
22oyldvzi6c_9-5-rgb_front and you can go ahead and alternate it or you can go ahead and do it at the same time
22tn7pvepq4_1-5-rgb_front what i am doing now is i am just focusing on the areas that are very helpful to us in our everyday live which is our hands and our feet
22tn7pvepq4_2-5-rgb_front we do not realize how much tension we carry in our hands and also so much in our palms as well
22tn7pvepq4_3-5-rgb_front so what i am going to do is i am just going to do a little stretch that i will show you as well
22tn7pvepq4_4-5-rgb_front i am just going to press and pull out press and pull out and i do this to my self all the time and it just stretches the thumb and allows it to have more mobility and range in motion
22tn7pvepq4_5-5-rgb_front you are totally in control like i said with the pressure with as far if it hurts just by the light touch just start there and work the muscle
22tn7pvepq4_6-5-rgb_front you do not want to extend the pressure cause then you muscle would lock up and tighten up the tension that you already have
22tqp3bhbni_10-5-rgb_front keeping the arms absolutely still bring the fingers back towards you
22tqp3bhbni_11-5-rgb_front pull as tight as you can through the forearm and then slowly like you are pushing through mud press the knuckles away from you and curl your fingernails towards the lower part of your wrist keeping those arms straight
22tqp3bhbni_12-5-rgb_front flex it back towards you
22tqp3bhbni_13-5-rgb_front really pull in in in in
22tqp3bhbni_14-5-rgb_front shoulders down abs pulled in and push it away from you
22tqp3bhbni_15-5-rgb_front knuckles scrape against a wall and curl in as tight as you can into your own wrist
22tqp3bhbni_16-5-rgb_front and then extend them
22tqp3bhbni_17-5-rgb_front reach your hands down straight towards the floor and release and relax
22tqp3bhbni_18-5-rgb_front do about ten of those to really strengthen the forearms and stretch the forearms
22uloqfxtdi_1-5-rgb_front and basically what this is is a brief overview of what is going to be in the report
22uloqfxtdi_10-5-rgb_front it is not a full page it is not three pages
22uloqfxtdi_11-5-rgb_front it is a paragraph
22uloqfxtdi_12-5-rgb_front sum up in one paragraph what the highlights of this report are
22uloqfxtdi_2-5-rgb_front let is say someone does not have time to take a look at your whole report at this particular time or maybe not even ever
22uloqfxtdi_3-5-rgb_front what would be the major points that you would want them to see and know that are in that report
22uloqfxtdi_4-5-rgb_front what would be the information that could possibly peak their interest to further examine your report
22uloqfxtdi_5-5-rgb_front that is what is going to be on this page
22uloqfxtdi_6-5-rgb_front now this is different than what we have written earlier in an earlier page where we have you know talked about this is why we wrote the report these are the highlights of the report
22uloqfxtdi_7-5-rgb_front this is this is a little bit different
22uloqfxtdi_8-5-rgb_front this is think and terms of if you had ten lines or less ten sentences or less to tell me what this page report is about do it
22uloqfxtdi_9-5-rgb_front and that is all it is
22z4wvfh0m0_0-5-rgb_front this segment is on the power down swing
22z4wvfh0m0_1-5-rgb_front once again you could be in a great position at the top of your back swing for a long drive and then wimp it to the ball and you are not going to hit the ball to your full potential
22z4wvfh0m0_10-5-rgb_front so your power down swing after a power back swing intent use everything and let the ball determine the angle that you are going to swing natural and hard
22z4wvfh0m0_2-5-rgb_front what is a power down swing
22z4wvfh0m0_3-5-rgb_front well number one it is intent meaning i want to hit a long drive i just do not want to be smooth so that is part of it is intent
22z4wvfh0m0_4-5-rgb_front another part of it is to make sure that you are using everything that you have your hands your arms your body your intent you are using everything
22z4wvfh0m0_5-5-rgb_front and you are using everything hard you want to hit the ball far
22z4wvfh0m0_6-5-rgb_front so just because you use everything could be weak
22z4wvfh0m0_7-5-rgb_front what swing plane should you use on your power down swing
22z4wvfh0m0_8-5-rgb_front let the ball determine that because if you are thinking where you want to be you are going to lose some natural strength
22z4wvfh0m0_9-5-rgb_front that is going to sap some strength away
22igdujk5he_1-5-rgb_front now if you look at the way this is set up this is one of your newer setups as far as shower goes
22igdujk5he_2-5-rgb_front you have a valve here which is your on and off and your temperature control we have a diverter here because in this shower i have a regular shower head above and i have a sunflower on the other wall so you can actually run them both at the same time or one or the other
22igdujk5he_3-5-rgb_front this one on the end is a flow rate valve and this is a water saver so you can crank it up if you really want to get a great burst of water or you can cool it down while you are shaving
22igdujk5he_4-5-rgb_front it will save some water and do good for the planet and that is how we are set up in here
22igdujk5he_5-5-rgb_front this one right here is the valve we are interested in and this has to come off
22igdujk5he_6-5-rgb_front now i am going to show you how to do that
22igdujk5he_7-5-rgb_front we are going to take this apart and we are going to fix it
22jv2ieovns_0-5-rgb_front so now katie and i are going to be showing you how to do shivasina or final relaxation or corpse pose for women in their second trimester of pregnancy
22jv2ieovns_1-5-rgb_front you will practice this at the end of your practice
22jv2ieovns_2-5-rgb_front it is a wonderful way to relax and to maybe meditate a little bit on connecting with your growing baby so katie go ahead and roll onto your back and start to stretch the legs out in front
22jv2ieovns_3-5-rgb_front what we are going to do is lift your right hip and place this blanket right under that right hip and then go ahead and relax the legs
22jv2ieovns_4-5-rgb_front what we are going to do is slide this bolster right under your knees so lifting the knees and sliding the bolster right under
22qgkxlm0j4_10-5-rgb_front and i am using a stick and a half of unsalted butter
22qgkxlm0j4_11-5-rgb_front you can see this is really room temperature
22qgkxlm0j4_12-5-rgb_front you do not want it melted
22qgkxlm0j4_13-5-rgb_front i mean we still want some solidness to it
22qgkxlm0j4_14-5-rgb_front but we definitely want it soft
22qgkxlm0j4_15-5-rgb_front and my beautiful sugar and i am going to pour that into the bowl lower my bowl and lock it in
22qgkxlm0j4_16-5-rgb_front i want to start it sort of slow speed till it starts to incorporate the sugar and then bring it up to about a medium speed
22qgkxlm0j4_17-5-rgb_front and i am looking for it to change to a light pale yellow color and to look well blended
22qgkxlm0j4_18-5-rgb_front and when we get there i will show you what that looks like
22qgkxlm0j4_19-5-rgb_front but you will kind of see it come together
22qgkxlm0j4_20-5-rgb_front it goes from this solid little clumpy thing to what is starting to be a batter like a cookie batter
22qgkxlm0j4_21_22_23-5-rgb_front ooh there is another good thing cookie batter yum i am thinking you would do this for about a minute a minute and a half at the most
22qgkxlm0j4_24-5-rgb_front so this is about the consistency that i am looking for
22qgkxlm0j4_25-5-rgb_front going to stop it for a minute open it up and you can see
22qgkxlm0j4_26-5-rgb_front kind of sticky mix
22qgkxlm0j4_27-5-rgb_front and then at about the same medium speed i am going to add my eggs one at a time
22qgkxlm0j4_8-5-rgb_front just make sure you are not using the whisk attachments
22qgkxlm0j4_9-5-rgb_front you want to use a paddle attachment
22yojqqob-k_0-5-rgb_front we talked about blood pressure and changes in blood pressure with exercise and now we want to talk a little bit about the oxygen delivery system and how your body gets accustomed to exercise and why this is important
22yojqqob-k_1-5-rgb_front as you exercise your body becomes more efficient at delivering oxygen to the tissues
22yojqqob-k_10-5-rgb_front their heart does not have to work as hard to deliver that blood and oxygen to the tissues because their tissues have become more efficient at converting oxygen into energy
22yojqqob-k_2-5-rgb_front this represents a red blood cell and on each red blood cell there are typically four oxygen molecules
22yojqqob-k_3-5-rgb_front your hearts job is to deliver those red blood cells to the tissues needed to create energy
22yojqqob-k_4-5-rgb_front this basically represents that red blood cell and as you exercise the tissues become more efficient at utilizing these oxygen molecules and the tissues also become more efficient at creating energy from these molecules
22yojqqob-k_5-5-rgb_front that is important for cardiovascular function
22yojqqob-k_6-5-rgb_front as you can see in this model there are blood vessels going to the heart and the heart also needs to become more efficient at utilizing these oxygen molecules because if it does not have oxygen those tissues will starve and die just like any other tissue of the body
22yojqqob-k_7-5-rgb_front as you exercise more your heart and all the other tissues of your body become more efficient at utilizing the oxygen for creating energy
22yojqqob-k_8-5-rgb_front we are not quite sure of the exact mechanism of how this works but we do know that with exercise you get more efficient at utilizing the oxygen
22yojqqob-k_9-5-rgb_front that is why athletes have lower heart rates
23ftukt8muw_10-5-rgb_front if you want to you can get a heat resistant work surface at guess you can go to a hardware store or lumberyard and get like a concrete fiber board something like that or you could go to of craft stores will sell like a metal work surface that is used for like working with lamp work with glass and that kind of thing
23ftukt8muw_11-5-rgb_front so yeah workbench that is about the right size you can have your soldering iron there you want to be near an electrical outlet where you can put the soldering iron and have enough space to work
23ftukt8muw_2-5-rgb_front you need a table that you can kind of clear away and kind of have you work right in front of you
23ftukt8muw_3-5-rgb_front what i have got here is about the right size maybe a little bit small because i have a bunch of things on it right now
23ftukt8muw_4-5-rgb_front i might not normally have everything that i use for circuit bending on the table at one time and i have just kind of done that here because we are making these videos but you do want a space that kind of a nice space you can clear and put your project in front of you a place where your soldering iron is handy
23ftukt8muw_5-5-rgb_front if you are right handed you put it over here if you are left handed you put it over there kind of obvious
23ftukt8muw_6-5-rgb_front whatever the material that the workbench is made out of is kind of important
23ftukt8muw_7-5-rgb_front this one is made out of wood which means i want to be kind of maybe extra careful about where my soldering iron is and make sure it is in the stand right
23ftukt8muw_8-5-rgb_front or in the standalone stand so that i do not burn my workbench
23ftukt8muw_9-5-rgb_front and the same is true for other materials one thing that you can get for a highly combustible surfaces like a wooden surface is
23gbjiu50qw_10-8-rgb_front and it does not matter what is this corn bread looks like
23gbjiu50qw_11-8-rgb_front it is going to be broken up and throw into our bigger dish anyway so it does not matter what it looks like
23gbjiu50qw_12-8-rgb_front and i like the shallow dish the big shallow dish because it get baked so quickly so i do not have to wait that long for corn bread to cook
23gbjiu50qw_13-8-rgb_front it does not take that long anyway but just is so nice and fast
23gbjiu50qw_14-8-rgb_front i am going to set that aside now that is all grease up and let is turn to our ingredients
23gbjiu50qw_15-8-rgb_front i need two cups of corn meal
23gbjiu50qw_16-8-rgb_front they make yellow corn meal and white corn meal
23gbjiu50qw_17-8-rgb_front i have yellow
23gbjiu50qw_18-8-rgb_front ahh recipes can vary between the yellow and the white so pay attention to that
23gbjiu50qw_19-8-rgb_front ahh most times when you just buy the corn meal it will have the recipe right on the box on how to make the corn bread
23gbjiu50qw_20-8-rgb_front i already put mine in my in my canester so we will talk it out together
23gbjiu50qw_21-8-rgb_front i just entered a cup i could not quite figure out
23gbjiu50qw_22-8-rgb_front so i am going to make sure i got two cups of this in there maybe enough add a litle bit more because i put in there under a cup both times
23gbjiu50qw_23-8-rgb_front let is see that is about right and that is it
23gbjiu50qw_24-8-rgb_front excellent
23gbjiu50qw_25-8-rgb_front that is the start of our corn bread
23gbjiu50qw_26-8-rgb_front add one big egg i already have my egg in here
23gbjiu50qw_27-8-rgb_front i am just going go ahead and get that pour in there
23gbjiu50qw_28-8-rgb_front there we go
23gbjiu50qw_29-8-rgb_front we can put that aside and i do need a cup of more ingredients
23gbjiu50qw_30-8-rgb_front we are gonna start mixing this together before we add everything else
23gbjiu50qw_4-8-rgb_front and corn meal gets sticky easily
23gbjiu50qw_5-8-rgb_front so ahh pour give it on there and then i will rub it all around and i m using a very white shallow dish
23gbjiu50qw_6-8-rgb_front is getting on it and i dripped it over there we will get that later
23gbjiu50qw_7-8-rgb_front all around yeah i put plenty in there
23gbjiu50qw_8-8-rgb_front that is good
23gbjiu50qw_9-8-rgb_front alright i cleared out all edges
23llbhn_mjg_10-5-rgb_front to get them out of the way and especially in a smaller space so that they would not break
23llbhn_mjg_11-5-rgb_front they did not have a chance of breaking
23llbhn_mjg_12-5-rgb_front so i went ahead and thought about what pictures i wanted to put where
23llbhn_mjg_13-5-rgb_front and it is important that you place your furniture before you put your pictures up on the wall
23llbhn_mjg_14-5-rgb_front just because a lot of times that those two things inform each other
23llbhn_mjg_15-5-rgb_front so the third thing that i did was to unload my kitchen
23llbhn_mjg_16-5-rgb_front and i have been moving in for a day already
23llbhn_mjg_17-5-rgb_front so this was these were the first boxes that i chose to unpack
23llbhn_mjg_18-5-rgb_front obviously because the kitchen is something that you use everyday and that you are going to need to use a lot
23llbhn_mjg_19-5-rgb_front and so so i unpacked my kitchen first
23llbhn_mjg_20-5-rgb_front then the second room that i am going to be unpacking is my living space
23llbhn_mjg_21-5-rgb_front putting the books up on the shelves
23llbhn_mjg_22-5-rgb_front and my reason for that is just to get the boxes out of the central placed area of my house
23llbhn_mjg_3-5-rgb_front so the order that i like to do things in is the first thing i like to do is to place my furniture
23llbhn_mjg_4-5-rgb_front or to somewhat place my furniture how i think it is going to be
23llbhn_mjg_5-5-rgb_front so you can see behind me i have placed my shelves here
23llbhn_mjg_6-5-rgb_front that was you know when i brought in the shelves i put them there
23llbhn_mjg_7-5-rgb_front i had thought about it beforehand
23llbhn_mjg_8-5-rgb_front i put my couch over here and put some other pieces of furniture in my living room and placed them
23llbhn_mjg_9-5-rgb_front after i did that the second thing that i did was to hang pictures
23o-xruwvda_0-5-rgb_front thinking about bike workouts as you progress from the easiest to the hardest one real basic workout i do them on mondays and fridays is an easy ride
23o-xruwvda_1-5-rgb_front and on the bike you always want to maintain between and rpms
23o-xruwvda_10-5-rgb_front that is something that you can do on your triathlon bike and that can help get you into the aero position
23o-xruwvda_11-5-rgb_front some of the long rides especially in the base period can be done on a road bike or with groups
23o-xruwvda_12-5-rgb_front but as you get into the period the cruise intervals basically what you are doing is a lactate threshold interval
23o-xruwvda_13-5-rgb_front so you are getting at a k time trial pace and holding it for say ten minute blocks with short blocks of recovery
23o-xruwvda_14-5-rgb_front as you move in deeper into the period or even into the race season you can do more intensive speed work intervals such as three repeats of three minutes typically with equal amounts of rest
23o-xruwvda_15-5-rgb_front or and you can progress from that smaller block to the bigger block
23o-xruwvda_16-5-rgb_front actually the opportunity to interview george hincapie who is the only rider that was on all seven of lance armstrong is tour de france winning teams and asked him about the biggest bang for the buck workouts and he said hill repeats
23o-xruwvda_17-5-rgb_front i mean when you are pressed for time do your warm up and go up and do hill repeats
23o-xruwvda_18-5-rgb_front and he even said if he contrasted the training he did for the classics with the tour the only difference was the length of the climbs
23o-xruwvda_19-5-rgb_front when you are doing the one day races you do lots of short steep power climbs and for the extended races you do longer more gradual seated kind of climbing
23o-xruwvda_2-5-rgb_front many make the error of trying to push too big of a gear
23o-xruwvda_20-5-rgb_front the same could be said for triathlon
23o-xruwvda_21-5-rgb_front so tailor those efforts that you do in those intervals to the kind of racing you are doing to do to the kind of train you are going to do
23o-xruwvda_22-5-rgb_front if you are doing a longer or a half iron man race such as iron man in canada or pacific crest that has some longer grades do some extended climbing intervals
23o-xruwvda_23-5-rgb_front but great bang for the buck workout climbing intervals
23o-xruwvda_3-5-rgb_front so on those easy days you can think about technique think about not rocking your hips in the saddle think about having a smooth pedal stroke and pedal in circles just smooth efficient circles
23o-xruwvda_4-5-rgb_front so that is your basic starting point for training are those easy days
23o-xruwvda_5-5-rgb_front moving on in intensity we have what we call extensive endurance where you do a lot of extensive endurance in the base period
23o-xruwvda_6-5-rgb_front they are longer rides they are not real difficult
23o-xruwvda_7-5-rgb_front your heart rate is on the lower end of the aerobic spectrum of max and you work for an extended period of time
23o-xruwvda_8-5-rgb_front as you get closer to the race period those become more intensive endurance where the overall duration is probably shorter but you will work at a little bit higher level
23o-xruwvda_9-5-rgb_front during the period a real valuable bike workout is to do what we call cruise intervals
23yw07exh34_0-5-rgb_front alvin dedeaux the next thing you are going to learn is false casting
23yw07exh34_1-5-rgb_front and false casting is basically any time you do not put the line down on the water
23yw07exh34_2-5-rgb_front that is a false cast
23yw07exh34_3-5-rgb_front so you can false cast for drying your line out or whatever but basically that is a false cast any time you do not put it on the water
23yw07exh34_4-5-rgb_front this back and forth back and forth that means i am false casting
23yw07exh34_5-5-rgb_front and you just want to remember that it is the same as the regular cast you are just not putting it down
23yw07exh34_6-5-rgb_front you are just not letting it hit the water on the back cast or on the forward cast
23yw07exh34_7-5-rgb_front so i am false casting
23zhgjvq8qm_0-5-rgb_front my name is anthony maddaloni and i am going to be talking about how to create a photographer is resume
23zhgjvq8qm_1-5-rgb_front so one of the things that you want to do as a photographer in a resume is highlight your experience
23zhgjvq8qm_16-5-rgb_front i have read resumes at jobs that i have held when i am looking to employ someone and i really as kind of cold as it sounds i do not want to read a biography about someone is life
23zhgjvq8qm_17-5-rgb_front i just want to see what they do and then i want to see if i want to call them up and see how they act
23zhgjvq8qm_18-5-rgb_front that is one way that i would make a photographic resume
23zhgjvq8qm_19-5-rgb_front that is one way that i would keep at a minimum of two pages
23zhgjvq8qm_2-5-rgb_front sometimes i craft different resumes to different jobs i am applying for
23zhgjvq8qm_20-5-rgb_front i actually prefer to keep it to one page and i would also encourage people to list references
23zhgjvq8qm_21-5-rgb_front i find references to be extremely valuable and i also take a lot of time to call my references and let them know that i am going to be using them as a reference and that if someone calls them to please call me so i know that the person you are giving your resume to is generally interested in you
23zhgjvq8qm_22-5-rgb_front that is one way that i would make a photographic resume
23zhgjvq8qm_3-5-rgb_front fortunately for me almost every type of photography job i have had has been very similar and so my resume tends to show a nice amount of consistency to it which to be kind of honest with you most photographers do not tend to have
23zhgjvq8qm_4-5-rgb_front i have been pretty lucky in fact i have stuck with one thing which is photographing people for a pretty long time photographing events documenting events
23zhgjvq8qm_5-5-rgb_front now there are so many different types of photography that you can create different types of resumes
23zhgjvq8qm_6-5-rgb_front say you can have a commercial studio photography resume and documentary style photography resume but one thing that is basic resume so to speak
23zhgjvq8qm_7-5-rgb_front you want to have your name your address your mailing address your phone number a lot of times i put an too
23znd2tloxu_0-5-rgb_front bring your chair to your left side and open up into the pose extending in all directions
23znd2tloxu_1-5-rgb_front now turn your left foot
23znd2tloxu_2-5-rgb_front look at your left foot turning
23znd2tloxu_3-5-rgb_front let the toes point to the left and now bring your left hand down to that chair right arm up
23znd2tloxu_4-5-rgb_front as turning your gaze up to the hand or straight ahead you can even bring your right hand to your hip
23znd2tloxu_5-5-rgb_front roll the shoulders back take a few breaths in your triangle pose
23znd2tloxu_6-5-rgb_front finish your exhale and up with an inhale back into start and come back to mountain before doing the other side
23_a6me-ala_0-5-rgb_front coming into the sanuk
23_a6me-ala_1-5-rgb_front we are going to be doing first the back of the leg massage
23_a6me-ala_10-5-rgb_front it is not too hard
23_a6me-ala_11-5-rgb_front it is not too gentle
23_a6me-ala_12-5-rgb_front you can feel the muscles in the back of the leg releasing relaxing the more you do it
23_a6me-ala_13-5-rgb_front going up and down as many times as you need to feel that relaxation coming into your client
23_a6me-ala_14-5-rgb_front and then to come out of this you pick up pick up steady yourself and just release the leg down
23_a6me-ala_2-5-rgb_front there is a nice little comfortable way to come into this because i am going to have a leg underneath her hip
23_a6me-ala_3-5-rgb_front so first i am going to fold up this leg closest to me
23_a6me-ala_4-5-rgb_front i am going to lift up the knee change hands steady myself as i lift i am rolling underneath her
23_a6me-ala_5-5-rgb_front i am going to do a rolling pin on the back of the legs
23_a6me-ala_6-5-rgb_front so literally just roll the back of the legs with the rolling pin arms
23_a6me-ala_7-5-rgb_front back and forth
23_a6me-ala_8-5-rgb_front back and forth
23_a6me-ala_9-5-rgb_front this feels really nice
23bwgbfbdc0_10-5-rgb_front it gets a lot of traffic in this area
23df10xarii_1-5-rgb_front to get the maximum amount of juice from the lemon first we would roll the lemon for a few seconds and then cut the lemon in half
23df10xarii_2-5-rgb_front if you do not have a juicer just use a regular fork punch it in the middle of the lemon and we can squeeze most of the amount of juice out of the lemon
23df10xarii_3-5-rgb_front we would repeat the same procedure with the other half of the lemon or a lime
23df10xarii_4-5-rgb_front i lot of people do not have a juicier and we do not necessarily have to have one to get the juice out of the lemon
23df10xarii_5-5-rgb_front at this point there is still a lot of pits in the juice so we would use the strainer to get the pit and the excess flesh of the juice and we would have clean lemon or lime juice for the dipping sauce and filling
23h1jhxdbfc_1-5-rgb_front all right more features about the table saw
23h1jhxdbfc_10-5-rgb_front i think it is a great safety feature these saws
23h1jhxdbfc_2-5-rgb_front here is one of my favorite ones that is often times on jobs we will be doing work we will have to take our materials we are working with and put them up and leave the saw unattended and we do not want to leave it where someone could walk up to it and come up and turn it on
23h1jhxdbfc_3-5-rgb_front god forbid something happens to them
23h1jhxdbfc_4-5-rgb_front this switch is the on and off switch
23h1jhxdbfc_5-5-rgb_front if you notice i can pick it up and nothing is happening that is because the key is not in
23h1jhxdbfc_6-5-rgb_front this is the key
23h1jhxdbfc_7-5-rgb_front once you put the key in you are able to turn it on and off
23h1jhxdbfc_8-5-rgb_front we do not have it connected to the power yet because we are showing you safety features
23h1jhxdbfc_9-5-rgb_front a lot of times this is a good idea to use your shroud
23ln0sw_8qo_0-5-rgb_front now that we have our skis put on appropriately and we have our correct size poles match up the next thing to do is learning how to actually nordic ski
23ln0sw_8qo_1-5-rgb_front learning the correct technique
23ln0sw_8qo_10-5-rgb_front and each time you do that you sort of push off and kick up your heel and push off that way
23ln0sw_8qo_11-5-rgb_front and just sort of like your doing a forward moon walk in your socks in the kitchen
23ln0sw_8qo_2-5-rgb_front the really wonderful thing about nordic skiing is it is a great sport that people enjoy doing and look forward to it every winter in the snow
23ln0sw_8qo_3-5-rgb_front it is also great exercise because you are getting a full body workout
23ln0sw_8qo_4-5-rgb_front you are using your arms your legs and your core as well
23ln0sw_8qo_5-5-rgb_front a lot of people wonder what is the appropriate way to move my feet and arms when i nordic ski
23ln0sw_8qo_6-5-rgb_front patrick is going to demonstrate that
23ln0sw_8qo_7-5-rgb_front you want to swing both your opposite foot and arm in front of you and push off
23ln0sw_8qo_8-5-rgb_front and the way i like to describe it is remember when you were a little kid and you would run through your mom is kitchen with your socks on and slide around
23ln0sw_8qo_9-5-rgb_front that is all your doing
23vzcowd5oe_0-5-rgb_front one of my absolute favorite things to do in the world is to buy a plane ticket somewhere and have no particular plans
23vzcowd5oe_1-5-rgb_front i think that that is the ultimate adventure
23vzcowd5oe_10-5-rgb_front listen to your fellow travelers
23vzcowd5oe_11-5-rgb_front ask your friends for advice
23vzcowd5oe_12-5-rgb_front go to the thorn tree on lonely planet
23vzcowd5oe_13-5-rgb_front there is a pluther of knowledge out there and every a click away
23vzcowd5oe_14-5-rgb_front whenever you are at your destination you can go to tourist agencies in centers of town airports train stations and they can set you up with whatever you need
23vzcowd5oe_15-5-rgb_front if you are arriving to a place where there is a big festival going on if you are going to the love parade or carnival then definitely be responsible and plan ahead if you actually want a bed to sleep in that night or be ready to party all night long or sleep on the streets
23vzcowd5oe_16-5-rgb_front i have done all of the above and they are definitely pros and cons to all of them
23vzcowd5oe_17-5-rgb_front if you are a by the books planner then get a travel agent or book things ahead of time and be responsible
23vzcowd5oe_18-5-rgb_front you know how you like to travel you know if you like to wing it or not
23vzcowd5oe_19-5-rgb_front i think it is an amazing thing to never know where you are going who you are going to meet or what train you are going to catch
23vzcowd5oe_2-5-rgb_front although i would say there are some things that you need to know before you go
23vzcowd5oe_3-5-rgb_front first of all we have already discussed read up on it
23vzcowd5oe_4-5-rgb_front know what you are doing know about the culture have an idea of what you are in for
23vzcowd5oe_5-5-rgb_front i also like to book a hotel where i am going to land for a couple of days just to have a plan and just get situated get over jet lag
23vzcowd5oe_6-5-rgb_front it is somewhat of an orientation of where i am
23vzcowd5oe_7-5-rgb_front recently i just went to bannock thailand
23vzcowd5oe_8-5-rgb_front i had been on the plane for hours and delirious with no sleep
23vzcowd5oe_9-5-rgb_front i arrived in bannock at one in the morning and i was so happy that heated the advice of a man i randomly met getting my oil changed in los angeles who told me to go to this particular guest house
23zpxzznl-q_0-5-rgb_front the last thing we need to do before we start applying makeup is involving the hair
23zpxzznl-q_1-5-rgb_front now when was the last time you saw the hulk with a nice part and a
23zpxzznl-q_10-5-rgb_front there is no flip you know or any other modern fashion sense going on here
23zpxzznl-q_11-5-rgb_front i mean it is very much you know so something wetting down and it is just coming down over the forehead
23zpxzznl-q_12-5-rgb_front that is fine
23zpxzznl-q_13-5-rgb_front i recommend very strongly doing this before you apply makeup
23zpxzznl-q_14-5-rgb_front it is a lot easier to get the makeup underneath here rather than have water and gel going on with your hair when you are already been transferred into a green goliath
23zpxzznl-q_15-5-rgb_front another option to keep in mind hair color spray
23zpxzznl-q_16-5-rgb_front now i do not think this is necessary for your hulk makeup but i put it out there as an option
23zpxzznl-q_17-5-rgb_front you can get dark green or even black hair color and put it on your whole costume
23zpxzznl-q_18-5-rgb_front so basically add it for you hair color but again it is only an option
23zpxzznl-q_19-5-rgb_front only if you want to go the extra mile
23zpxzznl-q_2-5-rgb_front um yeah you do not see that ever
23zpxzznl-q_3-5-rgb_front the hulk is hair is more crazy going in a million different directions
23zpxzznl-q_4-5-rgb_front you know he is raw
23zpxzznl-q_5-5-rgb_front he is savage
23zpxzznl-q_6-5-rgb_front so what i recommend you do is you get yourself some gel and you start applying it to your hair to kind of get a little bit more i do not know a little more childlike in a way
23zpxzznl-q_7-5-rgb_front the hulk is very simple
23zpxzznl-q_8-5-rgb_front so you can see here we have already done this on our hair
23zpxzznl-q_9-5-rgb_front it does not have to be going in a million directions but you can do that but as you know it is sloping down
24-ncyk2brk_0-5-rgb_front alright so now we are getting pretty good at rocking that torso
24-ncyk2brk_1-5-rgb_front there is a lot of fun things that you can do while torso hooping but you really need to make sure that you have momentum when doing these things
24-ncyk2brk_10-5-rgb_front alright go ahead and give that a shot
24-ncyk2brk_2-5-rgb_front one way to get momentum is as i am hooping to the left i am going to push with my left shoulder
24-ncyk2brk_3-5-rgb_front push into the hoop to really get that hoop rocking because what we are going to do now is take this move down to the floor
24-ncyk2brk_4-5-rgb_front so as i am hooping i am going to bend my right knee drop down to my butt
24-ncyk2brk_5-5-rgb_front woo you can see the hoop likes to fall
24-ncyk2brk_6-5-rgb_front if that happens you can bring it to your neck drop one shoulder in and the other and there you are wrapping the torso on your knees
24-ncyk2brk_7-5-rgb_front if this starts to get weird or wonky take your hand lift the hoop up and then if you want you could lean back with the hoop in lasso or from lasso stand back up take the hoop back to the torso and rock out here again
24-ncyk2brk_8-5-rgb_front once again from the torso to take it down to the floor bend your right knee drop down to your left get that momentum going hooping around the chest
24-ncyk2brk_9-5-rgb_front if you get tired lift up then you can play with the lasso down on the floor
24-pxxqodvq_0-5-rgb_front you have just finished writing a short story and you think maybe i should copyright this to protect myself but how do you do that
24-pxxqodvq_1-5-rgb_front hello i am robert todd and i am here to answer the question how do i obtain a copyright
24-pxxqodvq_2-5-rgb_front well the first thing i would direct you to doing is going to the website of the u s
24-pxxqodvq_3-5-rgb_front copyright office which can be found at www copyright gov which will answer most of your questions
24-pxxqodvq_4-5-rgb_front remember that a copyright is a constitutional guarantee of the authorship of a work of art or medium of expression it covers both published and unpublished works but it is a very specialized area and if you do not know what you are doing you can get into a lot of trouble
24-pxxqodvq_5-5-rgb_front i would recommend that after you go to the website and you look at the questions that you consider hiring a specialist who works in copyrights
24-pxxqodvq_6-5-rgb_front i am robert todd and thank you for watching
24-ujdkcwae_0-5-rgb_front i am beau timken master sake sommelier
24-ujdkcwae_1-5-rgb_front about six years ago when i opened my store true sake i had to develop it is a store that is dedicated to selling sake i had to develop a system that would allow people or kind of disarm them to describe what kind of sakes they like
24-ujdkcwae_10-5-rgb_front you can definitely achieve those flavors and those textures and those components in that category
24-ujdkcwae_11-5-rgb_front so we are using the taste match system
24-ujdkcwae_12-5-rgb_front if you feel like you want something where you would have a food that you would throw a white wine at specifically like a sauvignon blanc something like seafood or shellfish same thing goes with ginjo sake
24-ujdkcwae_13-5-rgb_front so again if you want to think in terms of light clean compact aromatic if you like that in your wines white i am not talking about big beefy reds and i am not talking about super fruity wines either kind of the neutral in between wines
24-ujdkcwae_14-5-rgb_front that is the same category overlap that you would have with ginjo style sake
24-ujdkcwae_2-5-rgb_front and the best way to do that is i would speak to their i would have them speak to their beer and wine profiles
24-ujdkcwae_3-5-rgb_front and basically everybody is comfortable talking to what they like in a wine and a beer and then what we can do is we can overlap that into different styles and categories of sake
24-ujdkcwae_4_5-5-rgb_front now ginjo in specif specifically is geared towards people who like lighter softer cleaner wines now taste match is a system that if if you like a big sauvignon blanc a big dirty zinfandel and you like big belgian is or big stouts you generally are not going to like the same sake maybe as somebody who likes a sauvignon blanc and a kiran beer
24-ujdkcwae_6-5-rgb_front those are cleaner lighter compact flavors
24-ujdkcwae_7-5-rgb_front well guess what
24-ujdkcwae_8-5-rgb_front in the sake world the cleaner lighter flavors are in sort of the ginjo category and what i will recommend when people come in they say well i kind of like a lighter white wine i would like a like a sauvignon blanc i like not a super oaky chardonnay it is got some body to it i like ales kind of clean beers
24-ujdkcwae_9-5-rgb_front then ginjo is definitely kind of your zone
248tleqwg-u_0-5-rgb_front so being able to paint a face with acrylics just a basic proportion face is is going to be really good if you do it enough so that you are really comfortable with just getting proportions right
248tleqwg-u_1-5-rgb_front it will really help in the future with your different painting compositions and and what you are working on
248tleqwg-u_2-5-rgb_front first of all when you really are comfortable and familiar with the bone structure and the muscles that are going on in a face and you are able to draw it that is when you should go in to in to trying to paint it
248tleqwg-u_3-5-rgb_front and once you have done it a couple times you you really are comfortable with just putting rendering a face with paints
248tleqwg-u_4-5-rgb_front you know where you are going to be starting and how you want to progress throughout the painting in order to get the complete and finished painting of the face
248tleqwg-u_5-5-rgb_front so it is just good to practice getting down everything proportionately
26xrvzcnwpm_0-3-rgb_front hi
26xrvzcnwpm_2-3-rgb_front once our first coat of paint has completely dried we need to know need to go back and look for areas that may not have been fully covered on our first coat
26xrvzcnwpm_3-3-rgb_front the key to this is looking at your first coat where you have painted and looking for areas for where they might white showing from underneath
26xrvzcnwpm_4-3-rgb_front for our second coat we are going to do the same process we did for our first coat we are going to get plenty paint on our roller and make even strokes when rolling out our paint
26xrvzcnwpm_5-3-rgb_front typically two coats should be more then enough to cover your wall
289anstq4au_1-5-rgb_front a lot of times the linebackers can make the right reads they can step up in the proper gaps they can do all the right things they can shed the blocks but they have to make sure they finish off the tackles properly
289anstq4au_10-5-rgb_front if the running back is able to keep his feet moving and get lower leverage he will take our linebacker and push him for a positive gain
289anstq4au_11-5-rgb_front we want to hit him and push for a negative gain
289anstq4au_12-5-rgb_front this is what it looks like live when you have a proper tackling technique video demo
289anstq4au_13-5-rgb_front he came in he hit low and made a good stop in the backfield and he finished off the tackle giving no hope to our running back
289anstq4au_2-5-rgb_front if not all that other hard work was for nothing
289anstq4au_3-5-rgb_front so what we want to talk about is how to come up in that gap break down stay low and make a good hit
289anstq4au_4-5-rgb_front demo he is going to attack his gap he is going to meet the blocker head on
289anstq4au_5-5-rgb_front the first thing he has to do is get low and shed that block
289anstq4au_6-5-rgb_front once he sheds the block he has to take on this guy
289anstq4au_7-5-rgb_front he wants his head to the outside and he wants to hit the running back low
289anstq4au_8-5-rgb_front he does not want to come up and make a high hit on a running back because a running back will bounce off of him
289anstq4au_9-5-rgb_front once he is hit low he wants to wrap up keep his feet moving and drive through the tackle
2a_jtxsvmvc_0-8-rgb_front hi everybody i am john graden from the martial arts teacher is association
2a_jtxsvmvc_1-8-rgb_front today i want to talk to you for just a few moments about rhythm in fighting
2a_jtxsvmvc_10-8-rgb_front the danger with a flowing kind of rhythm is that it can become kind of predictable
2a_jtxsvmvc_11-8-rgb_front so if you are like me and you are kind of a flowing rhythmic fighter you are going to make sure that you are always sticking in little fakes little feints to throw your opponent is aim off throw their set point off
2a_jtxsvmvc_12-8-rgb_front so here is an example of where you can use rhythm to your advantage
2a_jtxsvmvc_13-8-rgb_front watch this
2a_jtxsvmvc_14-8-rgb_front joining me from pro star mixed martial arts is mr joe brignoli
2a_jtxsvmvc_15-8-rgb_front this is a sneaky trick
2a_jtxsvmvc_16-8-rgb_front this is a rhythm drill
2a_jtxsvmvc_17-8-rgb_front let is say that as we are moving around i sucker him into a false rhythm just kind of hold your ground
2a_jtxsvmvc_18-8-rgb_front so we are moving and i am going to go in and out one and i am going to go in and out two and i am going to go in bang fake out and step in
2a_jtxsvmvc_19-8-rgb_front so i have used a broken rhythm
2a_jtxsvmvc_2-8-rgb_front as you become as you gain more experience as a coach and as a fighter you start to sense various rhythms with fighters
2a_jtxsvmvc_20-8-rgb_front this was first developed by bruce lee taught to joe louis who taught it to me and i am teaching it to you so you have got a good family tree
2a_jtxsvmvc_21-8-rgb_front watch this again
2a_jtxsvmvc_22-8-rgb_front this is a broken rhythm attack in and out in and out in fake out pow fire right and left right and left fake right go left so learn your rhythm learn to ascertain the rhythm of your opponent and then get sneaky with it
2a_jtxsvmvc_23-8-rgb_front that is called a broken rhythm attack
2a_jtxsvmvc_24-8-rgb_front i am john graden
2a_jtxsvmvc_25-8-rgb_front for information contact me at johngraden com
2a_jtxsvmvc_26-8-rgb_front thanks
2a_jtxsvmvc_3-8-rgb_front some rhythms are very complimentary and some are the exact opposite
2a_jtxsvmvc_4-8-rgb_front for instance some fighters have what i call a spastic rhythm about them
2a_jtxsvmvc_5-8-rgb_front they are just kind of they are all over the place
2a_jtxsvmvc_6-8-rgb_front you know if you were trying to shoot them it is kind of hard to get them
2a_jtxsvmvc_7-8-rgb_front often they are out of position though
2a_jtxsvmvc_8-8-rgb_front a lot of guys that are real spastic are rarely in good position to be able to fire
2a_jtxsvmvc_9-8-rgb_front other guys and i think i am included in this have a much more flowing kind of rhythm
2avq_st7qpu_0-5-rgb_front right here i am showing you a version of a sleeve that we call a long tabbed sleeve
2avq_st7qpu_1-5-rgb_front oh very creative and inventive
2avq_st7qpu_10-5-rgb_front and typically it is going to button
2avq_st7qpu_11-5-rgb_front you are going to have a button hole and a button
2avq_st7qpu_12-5-rgb_front and the tab is going to come from the inside going out or outside going in
2avq_st7qpu_13-5-rgb_front it really does not matter
2avq_st7qpu_14-5-rgb_front this one we will do inside going out
2avq_st7qpu_15-5-rgb_front and you would take the fabric which we will gather it
2avq_st7qpu_16-5-rgb_front tab it button it and then you have your fitted sleeve
2avq_st7qpu_17-5-rgb_front but it does have a little bit of umph down in the bottom
2avq_st7qpu_18-5-rgb_front because the tab creates a tighter closure
2avq_st7qpu_2-5-rgb_front huh
2avq_st7qpu_3-5-rgb_front because that is exactly what it is
2avq_st7qpu_4-5-rgb_front it is a long sleeve that is fitted like i showed you a fitted sleeve
2avq_st7qpu_5-5-rgb_front or you could do it a little bit looser
2avq_st7qpu_6-5-rgb_front i have shown a fitted sleeve with the seam lines down the center of each
2avq_st7qpu_7-5-rgb_front but remember the center is not the center necessarily on your drawing
2avq_st7qpu_8-5-rgb_front because you have to think about where the center is on the body and then put that into your drawing
2avq_st7qpu_9-5-rgb_front so we have what makes it a tabbed sleeve is the fact that at the wrist line there is a tab
2az2h4i1v2i_0-1-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson
2az2h4i1v2i_1-1-rgb_front right now we are working with our post players giving them some moves that they can use to be successful and be scorers in our offense
2az2h4i1v2i_10-1-rgb_front so you are going to pivot fake step through with the same foot you pivoted with power dribble hop and score
2az2h4i1v2i_11-1-rgb_front you might want to right that down and go through those sequences together
2az2h4i1v2i_12-1-rgb_front we are going to show you what it looks like at full speed here
2az2h4i1v2i_13-1-rgb_front all right here we go
2az2h4i1v2i_14-1-rgb_front good shot fake takes it to the hole and scores it
2az2h4i1v2i_15-1-rgb_front and that is called the up and under move
2az2h4i1v2i_16-1-rgb_front that move alone right there will separate good players from the lower players
2az2h4i1v2i_17-1-rgb_front so if you can learn that move you are going to be at the higher caliber of all the centers
2az2h4i1v2i_2-1-rgb_front one move we are going to talk about right now is called the up and under move
2az2h4i1v2i_3-1-rgb_front and usually this is used when the defender is playing on the bottom side and he is forcing this guy to turn into the middle because he knows that he is already got a good drop step so we are trying to take his drop step away and make him one dimensional which means that this post player is going to have to catch the ball and he is going to have to spin inside to face the basket because the bottom side is taken away
2az2h4i1v2i_4-1-rgb_front so we have got a move called the up and under move
2az2h4i1v2i_5-1-rgb_front so what he is going to do this time is he is going to catch the ball we are going to kind of walk through this together
2az2h4i1v2i_6-1-rgb_front he is going to catch the ball he is going to spin first of all and face up the basket
2az2h4i1v2i_7-1-rgb_front now when he does that this guy is going to jump out to block his shot
2az2h4i1v2i_8-1-rgb_front what he is going to do then with the same foot that he pivoted with he is going to pivot around he is going to shot fake him as this guy shot fakes and gets off balance then he is going to step through with the same foot and he can power dribble now power dribble get that other foot and a hop so that he can face up and he can make that shot
2az2h4i1v2i_9-1-rgb_front it is kind of a complicated move but if you work at it slow and then speed it up you become much better at it
2eapbarsm8c_0_1_2-5-rgb_front lots of vodkas lots of decisions but what is the best how are you my name is jeff klein and i am a vodka connoisseur and bartender here at beak is old florida in st pete
2eapbarsm8c_10-5-rgb_front but if you are thinking what is the best without going too high but i still want to spend some money great flavor very important to me mixes with anything i am going to say belvedere
2eapbarsm8c_11-5-rgb_front belvedere to me is a great vodka little on the higher end but very distinct crisp flavor
2eapbarsm8c_12-5-rgb_front and if to you the best vodka is getting no hangover i am going to say stick with absolute
2eapbarsm8c_13-5-rgb_front absolute and water guaranteed no hangover the next day
2eapbarsm8c_14-5-rgb_front so my name is jeff klein vodka connoisseur bartender here at beak is old florida and that those are the best vodkas
2eapbarsm8c_3-5-rgb_front and i am here to tell you what is the best vodka
2eapbarsm8c_4-5-rgb_front now that in and of itself is a bit of a loaded question
2eapbarsm8c_5-5-rgb_front for me the best vodka flavor taste if money is no issue would be chopin vodka
2eapbarsm8c_6-5-rgb_front a beautiful potato vodka from poland
2eapbarsm8c_7-5-rgb_front but if that is not what you consider the best then maybe you are thinking what is the best for the price
2eapbarsm8c_8-5-rgb_front to me best for the price is going to be skyy vodka
2eapbarsm8c_9-5-rgb_front inexpensive very flavorful easily accessible
2eg_qnmuafu_0_1-1-rgb_front the question was asked how to create a bat speed in hitting well one of the things we need to do then to make sure that we have the strongest body possible so we need to get in the workout room and work on our body to make sure that we have all the strength that we can muster with the body that the good lords given us
2eg_qnmuafu_10-1-rgb_front to do that we are going to take a toe touch and once the heel is planted this back knee is going to start to turn
2eg_qnmuafu_11-1-rgb_front as the bat knee turns it is still ahead of the bat and as we start the bat to the ball it is going to be we are going to be completely rotated by the time we get the knob to the ball in a position of bat lag
2eg_qnmuafu_12-1-rgb_front we need to have this back foot perpendicular with the ground on our toe this front side firm and straight with our front knee and this back knee bent in the knee behind knee position
2eg_qnmuafu_13-1-rgb_front this extra use of our lower body and core section will help us with our bat velocity our bat speed
2eg_qnmuafu_14-1-rgb_front so make sure that you use your lower half and your core section throughout your swing and you get in the appropriate sequence
2eg_qnmuafu_15-1-rgb_front but we are basically going to go we are going to take a negative move to gain some momentum we are going to make a toe touch heel plant bat lag contact palm up palm down with our arms still slightly flexed throw the bat to position of extension about chest high and finish above our shoulder
2eg_qnmuafu_16-1-rgb_front the lower the pitch the higher we are going to finish the higher the pitch the lower we are going to finish
2eg_qnmuafu_17-1-rgb_front but make sure that when you are trying to create bat speed that you make sure that you use your lower section of your body to create extra force and extra bat speed
2eg_qnmuafu_18-1-rgb_front the combined use of your entire body especially getting this back knee turned and your back hip through will create more bat velocity
2eg_qnmuafu_19-1-rgb_front and that is how you create more bat speed in hitting
2eg_qnmuafu_2-1-rgb_front the other thing that we need to do is be able to use our entire body during the swing
2eg_qnmuafu_3-1-rgb_front that creates more velocity in the bat and also creates more force
2eg_qnmuafu_4-1-rgb_front the force and the velocity combined makes the ball go further
2eg_qnmuafu_5-1-rgb_front there is several things to note when we consider batting speed and that is the use of our core section and the lower part of our body
2eg_qnmuafu_6-1-rgb_front one of the things we are going to need through the swing is balance
2eg_qnmuafu_7-1-rgb_front to create that balance we need the nice triangle that keeps the knees inside our feet throughout the swing
2eg_qnmuafu_8-1-rgb_front the knees need to stay in this position inside our feet
2eg_qnmuafu_9-1-rgb_front the other thing that we need to do is to make sure that we use our hips and our legs to get through the swing before the bat gets there because that helps with bat velocity
2fgg0qarpuc_0-8-rgb_front hi i am art malov from your dating coach in new york city
2fgg0qarpuc_1-8-rgb_front and i am the author of park bench dating
2fgg0qarpuc_10-8-rgb_front but until you spend some time with the girl and for let is say fifteen minutes twenty minutes then you can actually say hey listen can i get you a drink

2fgg0qarpuc_17-8-rgb_front cause wh as soon as the girl hears hey can i buy you a drink she thinks what a wuss
2fgg0qarpuc_18-8-rgb_front and we do not want that

2fgg0qarpuc_2-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about how to buy someone a drink
2fgg0qarpuc_20-8-rgb_front and so do not buy a drink in five minutes but buying a drink you know in fifteen twenty minutes is fine
2fgg0qarpuc_21-8-rgb_front as long as you do it in correct way
2fgg0qarpuc_22-8-rgb_front this is art malov and this has been how to buy someone a drink
2fgg0qarpuc_3-8-rgb_front and there is few different elements
2fgg0qarpuc_4-8-rgb_front you see most guys think they wanna they should buy a drink right away
2fgg0qarpuc_5-8-rgb_front the first opening line for them is hey can i buy you a drink
2fgg0qarpuc_6-8-rgb_front and that is not the right way to do it
2fgg0qarpuc_7-8-rgb_front because what it tells the girl is you are just trying to buy her attention
2fgg0qarpuc_8-8-rgb_front you are just trying to make buying a drink for her sort of bargaining for her attention
2fgg0qarpuc_9-8-rgb_front so do not buy a drink in the first five minutes
2fq1vwh06us_0-5-rgb_front in this video i am going to be talking about what i call over under
2fq1vwh06us_1-5-rgb_front now this is a pretty difficult crystal stick stick trick
2fq1vwh06us_10-5-rgb_front now i am not sure if i can actually break this down into parts and execute it but what happens i will spin like this spin it under and then because of the way my wrists and arm work together i will be over for one rotation and back down to under
2fq1vwh06us_11-5-rgb_front again this is something you just need to try and see if you can work out for yourself
2fq1vwh06us_12-5-rgb_front to switch into it you are doing horizontal circles catch in the center follow the crystal stick out over under over under
2fq1vwh06us_13-5-rgb_front if you see i am always keeping my control stick ninety degrees perpendicular to the crystal stick just following the stick around with my wrist like that
2fq1vwh06us_2-5-rgb_front it will take some practice and it will take some thinking just to figure out what exactly you are trying to do
2fq1vwh06us_3-5-rgb_front first off i will just show you what it looks like
2fq1vwh06us_4-5-rgb_front this is over under
2fq1vwh06us_5-5-rgb_front you are going to start from horizontal circles and go over under just like that
2fq1vwh06us_6-5-rgb_front now it might be hard to figure out what i am doing from how it looks
2fq1vwh06us_7-5-rgb_front what i am actually doing is i am in a horizontal circle i catch the crystal stick in the center of it with my control stick
2fq1vwh06us_8-5-rgb_front now i am going to follow the crystal stick as it spins
2fq1vwh06us_9-5-rgb_front i am going to keep my control stick ninety degrees to the crystal stick follow it as it spins
2g29ijspvxi_0-5-rgb_front hi if you have ever wondered how to massage away a stiff calf i can show you how
2g29ijspvxi_1-5-rgb_front i am sundae with natural sundae
2g29ijspvxi_10-5-rgb_front now that that is clear you are free to move to the calf so what you want to do is start at the ankle and move all the way up to the calf and your fingers can trace that muscle and actually hold that muscle right in your hand just like that
2g29ijspvxi_11-5-rgb_front you want to apply a little bit more oil and actually your palm is the best part of your hand
2g29ijspvxi_12-5-rgb_front to massage a calf you can go from your palm all the way up to your forearm and even your elbow as long as you are careful just like that and of course on the other side using that forearm very gently getting that ankle being very careful of that ankle area
2g29ijspvxi_13-5-rgb_front massaging that calf with that forearm
2g29ijspvxi_14-5-rgb_front you can rotate your forearm like this and really get in between those two muscles
2g29ijspvxi_15-5-rgb_front you have got your gastrock right here and your soleus
2g29ijspvxi_16-5-rgb_front those are your two calf muscles
2g29ijspvxi_17-5-rgb_front you want to really get in between there
2g29ijspvxi_18-5-rgb_front separate those muscles and create a lot of room for the blood to flow and that is a very basic way to soothe a sore calf muscle
2g29ijspvxi_19-5-rgb_front i am sundae with natural sundae
2g29ijspvxi_2-5-rgb_front now the first thing you want to do is make sure your client is relaxed and the best way to do this is just rock your client a little bit
2g29ijspvxi_20-5-rgb_front thanks
2g29ijspvxi_3-5-rgb_front you just rock that client
2g29ijspvxi_4-5-rgb_front you just shake them a little bit gently of course
2g29ijspvxi_5-5-rgb_front make sure they are not holding any tension and that they are fully relaxed
2g29ijspvxi_6-5-rgb_front then what you want to do actually before you massage the calf you want to massage up in the hamstrings because if there is any congestion in here
2g29ijspvxi_7-5-rgb_front if this is congested this congestion is not going to go anywhere so you need to get the congestion out of the hamstring first and then work the calves so real quick just work the calf
2g29ijspvxi_8-5-rgb_front you can do some basic strokes gliding all the way up the leg using the fingers and the palms very gently and kneading is also a wonderful way to massage the hamstrings
2g29ijspvxi_9-5-rgb_front just do some kneading
2ggrx5bccbe_1-5-rgb_front every school has to decide what kind of school their going to be
2ggrx5bccbe_2-5-rgb_front are they going to be tournament school or mostly a kids school mostly adults are they going to be a tournament school where they teach you how to score points and bring home a trophy
2ggrx5bccbe_3-5-rgb_front when i first started martial arts i thought i was a really good fighter
2ggrx5bccbe_4-5-rgb_front i joined the army and went to germany where i could not find a school that was the same style and i suddenly found out that i was not nearly as good as i thought i was when the rules changed
2ggrx5bccbe_5-5-rgb_front through the years i discovered that it is very important to have a curriculum that is well rounded addresses stand up fighting and ground fighting
2huxyz-qpt4_1-8-rgb_front today we are at chapel ledges in ashville massachusetts trustees of the reservation property and in this series i am going to be talking about rock climbing gear
2huxyz-qpt4_10-8-rgb_front bad climber etiquette is to fill your chalk bag with all kinds of loose chalk sit down have it dumped out and leave a big mess behind so a nice concise chalk bag that meets your style with a chalk ball inside that is going to give your hands a little powdery coating to keep the sweat down makes you grip the rock a little bit better maybe it gives you a little psychological advantage too while you are up there so choose what fits you
2huxyz-qpt4_2-8-rgb_front we are going to talk about rock climbing chalk and chalk bags
2huxyz-qpt4_3-8-rgb_front it use to be a contentious issue back in the is or so people thought it was cheating to use chalk
2huxyz-qpt4_4-8-rgb_front nowadays most of everyone uses it still makes since to think about of how you use it how much you use what it does for you
2huxyz-qpt4_5-8-rgb_front the bag that you are going to carry it in here is a couple of variations they come in all sorts of styles shapes and colors
2huxyz-qpt4_6-8-rgb_front generally speaking something about this size is big enough
2huxyz-qpt4_7-8-rgb_front if you are going to be bouldering and hanging out in one place for a while you might buy a big bucket to just sit on the ground but if you are carrying it with you this is plenty big enough
2huxyz-qpt4_8-8-rgb_front inside the bag you have got chalk in one form or another i want to recommend to you a chalk ball because this contains the chalk inside a fabric covering
2huxyz-qpt4_9-8-rgb_front you can see my hands are still getting chalky but it is not going to spill
2jm303de1t8_0-3-rgb_front before you go in a cave do not go alone and do not go without a guide
2jm303de1t8_1-3-rgb_front it is very important
2jm303de1t8_2-3-rgb_front it is dangerous
2jm303de1t8_3-3-rgb_front if you are staying to wait on each other you just sit on your feet and maybe it is not so comfortable but it protects you from the cold clay or stone where you would sit or you just stay like this because in this way your bottom is not on the floor on the cold floor
2jm303de1t8_4-3-rgb_front it can get cold even if you are warm and you are not cold at all your bottom can be and the cold temperature is bad so just sit like this but do not fall asleep
2jm303de1t8_5-3-rgb_front this light is going up through this tube and it is very good because when this movement is on it is very warm
2jm303de1t8_6-3-rgb_front for example i am the injured person and i am in this plastic thing and the carbide light is here because this is the tricky part because it is here and the warm temperature gives the biggest power of warmness in your body if you are in danger of getting cold
2jpumnlren4_0-5-rgb_front so i want to talk for a second about what to do with your throwing water
2jpumnlren4_1-5-rgb_front once you have thrown for all day and you have got some pretty muddy water going the bottom of this bucket is going to have a sludge on it
2jpumnlren4_10-5-rgb_front but that gives me a little more space to add
2jpumnlren4_11-5-rgb_front and now once you have done this for a while and you have drained off the water several times once you get to the point where you can not add in anything else i take that off and i let the bucket dry
2jpumnlren4_12-5-rgb_front and you can either reuse that clay if you have a pug mill or if you really like wedging or you can do what i do which is i let that dry completely knock it out of the bucket into the trashcan and put the bucket back in the sink
2jpumnlren4_2-5-rgb_front you do not want this going down your drain
2jpumnlren4_3-5-rgb_front so i have got a really simple way of keeping this part of the clay out of my drain
2jpumnlren4_4-5-rgb_front what i do is i just keep a couple of buckets here and i will take the sponge out of my water and i will mix that sludge into the water so that it will come out of the bottom of the bucket mostly
2jpumnlren4_5-5-rgb_front and then once it is mixed up i will go ahead and pour it into one of my buckets
2jpumnlren4_6-5-rgb_front now my bucket is ready for clean water for my next throwing
2jpumnlren4_7-5-rgb_front now after a few days or hours or however long it takes the clay will start to settle and the water will rise to the top of the bucket so you can keep using your bucket over and over by just tipping it and letting the water runoff
2jpumnlren4_8-5-rgb_front you can see that everything that is running off is just clear water
2jpumnlren4_9-5-rgb_front and this bucket is almost full
2kgzerm1dt0_0-5-rgb_front my name is ryan wells
2kgzerm1dt0_1-5-rgb_front i am the owner of a local fish store in lindon utah called reef runners
2kgzerm1dt0_10-5-rgb_front once again in order to keep your tank clean the most important thing to do is regular water changes and keeping the cleanliness of your water overall
2kgzerm1dt0_11-5-rgb_front if you have a buildup of nutrients or different types of pollutants this is what will cause a dirty or unclean tank
2kgzerm1dt0_2-5-rgb_front there are various ways to keep a tank clean
2kgzerm1dt0_3-5-rgb_front first of all let is briefly define what clean is
2kgzerm1dt0_4-5-rgb_front a lot of people determine a clean tank by one that has little to no visible algae the water is clear and that your livestock is very healthy looking
2kgzerm1dt0_5-5-rgb_front if you have algae problems this can often be called a dirty tank
2kgzerm1dt0_6-5-rgb_front in order to get rid of algae there is some simple tips you can do in cleaning your tank
2kgzerm1dt0_7-5-rgb_front first of all do not overstock your tank and do not overfeed the livestock that you currently have in your tank
2kgzerm1dt0_8-5-rgb_front another important thing to keep in mind is that you have current livestock in there to help control your algae or the overall cleanliness of your tank
2kgzerm1dt0_9-5-rgb_front a lot of these include hermit crabs different algae eating snails some starfish and even some of your fish may nip at or eliminate different types of algae
2l0cik45vha_0-1-rgb_front hi
2l0cik45vha_10-1-rgb_front so now we can peel the insulation off the wire back to where we started and then the paper comes right off and we can clip it off
2l0cik45vha_11-1-rgb_front the other handy device that we will need when we are stripping the wires is a pair of vike which are just cutters and we can cut the wire
2l0cik45vha_12-1-rgb_front we will cut the insulation off the wire
2l0cik45vha_13-1-rgb_front so now we have got it down to this point and we have insulation on the wire that we want stripped off
2l0cik45vha_14-1-rgb_front so we have these little strippers
2l0cik45vha_15-1-rgb_front the wire strippers we have different sizes
2l0cik45vha_16-1-rgb_front now you can see some of them are larger than others
2l0cik45vha_17-1-rgb_front we just line up for the proper size wire
2l0cik45vha_18-1-rgb_front this is a gage wire so we put it right in here clamp it down
2l0cik45vha_19-1-rgb_front that actually cuts through insulation so we got to cut right down and now we pull them apart
2l0cik45vha_2-1-rgb_front now we are going to use a couple of basic tools to help strip some romex wire if you are doing any wiring
2l0cik45vha_20-1-rgb_front so what we have essentially done is severed insulation without touching the wire and the insulation will pull off as we slide these to the side
2l0cik45vha_3-1-rgb_front the first thing we have to do is get the sheathing off outside of it and to do that we have this stripper
2l0cik45vha_4-1-rgb_front there is a water gage meter on this stripper
2l0cik45vha_5-1-rgb_front if you need to know what size wire you have and inside there is a little razor that is used to cut through that wire
2l0cik45vha_6-1-rgb_front you see it hanging down from here a little bit
2l0cik45vha_7-1-rgb_front so that when we actually put a wire in here it will cup right down the center of the wire so that it will not cut either of the conductors in it it might touch the ground wire
2l0cik45vha_8-1-rgb_front so we just put it in here squeeze it down
2l0cik45vha_9-1-rgb_front now that little razor has gone down into the wire and as we pull the wire through it it cuts through
2l2hhr4nmlm_1-5-rgb_front and today we are building a campfire in my backyard in the snow
2l2hhr4nmlm_2-5-rgb_front and besides roasting marshmallows which is a lot of fun to do you can actually do some other really really good food in a campfire
2l2hhr4nmlm_3-5-rgb_front i mean there is more complicated things that are really fun like dutch oven cooking but we are not going to get into that right now
2l2hhr4nmlm_4-5-rgb_front hotdogs are great things to be able to cook in a campfire and you are going to be using a stick just similar to this and just kinda skewing it and cooking it
2l2hhr4nmlm_5-5-rgb_front also you can make a little hobo dinner
2l2hhr4nmlm_6-5-rgb_front you can have tin foil and you can wrap potatoes and carrots and some really good things like that and put it all inside the tin foil and put it right inside of a campfire
2l2hhr4nmlm_7-5-rgb_front so besides having a campfire for warmth and survival skills it is also a great way to cook food and to be able to enjoy some really really tasty food on a campfire or in a campfire setting that you would not be able to do inside
2l8ktoopbru_0-5-rgb_front another way to make these trailing vines and ivies is to use glue
2l8ktoopbru_1-5-rgb_front you can take your pipe cleaner and add a few branches by twisting
2l8ktoopbru_2-5-rgb_front just twisting them on like that and then we will glue our leaves on with a nice thick kraft glue and set that to dry
2l8ktoopbru_3-5-rgb_front then you can bend the pipe cleaner to the shape that you want
2l8ktoopbru_4-5-rgb_front so you just take the glue and put some good dots of glue nice and thick because the glue sort of soaks into the fuzz on the pipe cleaner
2l8ktoopbru_5-5-rgb_front so you want to use a good amount and put that glue all the way up in different spots like this and then just put your leaves on there and let that dry
2lmjgqzmc64_0-8-rgb_front so before we start the message we might want to get a little bit of oil and again in this case i have grape seed oil and i am going to get a little bit get a little bit oily because we are working on the face and the ears and the neck only a tiny bit
2lmjgqzmc64_1-8-rgb_front you can always add more but we do not want to put a lot of oil on her face but we do need a little bit because we will be working on some of the neck muscles we need that gliding motion which oil can help provide
2lmjgqzmc64_10-8-rgb_front o k
2lmjgqzmc64_11-8-rgb_front want to check in and if you are not sure if you get oil and you have had it for a little bit of time please smell it first
2lmjgqzmc64_12-8-rgb_front if it smells a little unusual throw it away and get more
2lmjgqzmc64_13-8-rgb_front now you definitely do not want to put oil on a child that might be a little bit rancid a little bit tainted at all
2lmjgqzmc64_14-8-rgb_front it is very inexpensive just throw it away if you are unsure and get more
2lmjgqzmc64_15-8-rgb_front and just again put a little bit of oil you can always add more and warming your hands before you actually make contact through touch
2lmjgqzmc64_2-8-rgb_front so i add oil to my hands and i am warming them up
2lmjgqzmc64_3-8-rgb_front warming them up weather i am using oil or not so warming it up with oil
2lmjgqzmc64_4-8-rgb_front how is that smell does it smell o k
2lmjgqzmc64_5-8-rgb_front yeah should not have a lot of smell at all
2lmjgqzmc64_6-8-rgb_front so natalie is just probably smelling my hands
2lmjgqzmc64_7-8-rgb_front so warming up the oil and i am going to double check in with you before i even touch you at all
2lmjgqzmc64_8-8-rgb_front is it o k
2lmjgqzmc64_9-8-rgb_front if i give you a message with oil
2oumczapt_m_0-8-rgb_front a question is asked how to pick a youth baseball bat
2oumczapt_m_1-8-rgb_front this happens to be a wooden bat most youth players in this day and age use a metal bat because they are tend to be lighter and more manageable
2oumczapt_m_10-8-rgb_front when choosing a bat there is two things that you can do to help to make sure that you are choosing the right bat
2oumczapt_m_11-8-rgb_front number one is go get a demo or borrow a bat and let the player swing the bat to make sure that it feels right for him
2oumczapt_m_12-8-rgb_front but another test you might do is to grip the bat at the top of the handle and if you can with one hand cast the bat this way and not let the bat drop below parallel then that would be a good test to make sure that he can handle the bat with two hands
2oumczapt_m_13-8-rgb_front i might suggest that you get the heaviest and largest bat possible that he can still control because the extra density in the bat will make the ball go further
2oumczapt_m_14-8-rgb_front do the heaviest and the longest bat he can swing comfortably or do this test with would be an appropriate bat for that player and that is a good tip on how to choose the right bat for your player
2oumczapt_m_2-8-rgb_front the bat is measured both in inches and in ounces
2oumczapt_m_3-8-rgb_front so if a bat is a thirty two thirty one or a minus three that is means that the length of the bat is a thirty two inch bat and it is a twenty nine ounce bat so that would be a minus three bat
2oumczapt_m_4-8-rgb_front most players especially young in age from six or eight on up until ten or twelve would tend to use bats that have a larger drop in the ounces
2oumczapt_m_5-8-rgb_front a minus eleven bat for instance would be if it were a thirty inch bat would be a nineteen ounce bat
2oumczapt_m_6-8-rgb_front so when you hear minus three minus ten minus eleven that means it is the differential between the length of the bat and the ounces of the bat
2oumczapt_m_7-8-rgb_front usually the smaller the player the more minus there is the lighter the bat is and usually the larger the player the heavier the bat would be
2oumczapt_m_8-8-rgb_front most players in the high school level on up until they start using wood and get into professional baseball use minus three exclusively because it is a rule for high school and college
2oumczapt_m_9-8-rgb_front so a minus three bat would a thirty two twenty nine or a thirty three thirty because it is three ounces lighter than the length
2qe61mte5v4_1-8-rgb_front ok for our next point now we need to decide about the hair style whatever the customer has decided how he would like his hair to go
2qe61mte5v4_10-8-rgb_front so with the customer having a parting he obviously is not going have the hair going straight forward or going back
2qe61mte5v4_11-8-rgb_front so we still need to give some indication to our wig maker on what kind of style the customer is going to have
2qe61mte5v4_12-8-rgb_front so what i am going to do now is actually put the indication of the flow of the hair so we want the hair to go around like this
2qe61mte5v4_13-8-rgb_front now the reason i am putting this slight curve into this is that any good wig maker will actually out each individual hair into the hair piece so it gradually starts to go back
2qe61mte5v4_14-8-rgb_front same with this point of parting
2qe61mte5v4_15-8-rgb_front we do not want the hair being put into the base of the piece pointing this way what we want is for the hair to be slightly pointed this way in the hair piece
2qe61mte5v4_16-8-rgb_front when the customer has a parting the hair is going to flow backwards and not forwards pushing itself onto the face
2qe61mte5v4_17-8-rgb_front a real head of hair tends to act differently than a hair piece so you really do have to give the hair piece direction which way to go
2qe61mte5v4_18-8-rgb_front so as i say giving the hair direction like so
2qe61mte5v4_19-8-rgb_front so the hair piece is going to sweep around like this the hair will come over the forehead and sweep around
2qe61mte5v4_2-8-rgb_front so we are going to say for instance that this customer wants a parting
2qe61mte5v4_3-8-rgb_front now a parting should never begin higher that where the hairline begins on the hair piece
2qe61mte5v4_4-8-rgb_front so you can see the hair through here this is where we want to begin the parting
2qe61mte5v4_5-8-rgb_front if we began the parting here then what would happen is when we get the hair piece back we are going to have hair going over skin
2qe61mte5v4_6-8-rgb_front and unfortunately even though these hair pieces are good they are not so good that it does not actually show the hair going over the skin it tends to give the hair piece away
2qe61mte5v4_7-8-rgb_front so my suggestion for that is always to have the parting to begin wherever the hairline begins
2qe61mte5v4_8-8-rgb_front so that would be at this point
2qe61mte5v4_9-8-rgb_front so the customer wants a parting so what i am going to do is put a dotted line here and all the way back to about just the tip of the crown
2shrot4rypk_0-5-rgb_front hi i am lori schneider with figs catering in austin texas
2shrot4rypk_10-5-rgb_front it is a lot of fun to work with and it tastes great
2shrot4rypk_2-5-rgb_front today i am going to show you how to make a spaghetti squash casserole with a pink and almond crust
2shrot4rypk_3-5-rgb_front i have been in the culinary industry for about years
2shrot4rypk_4-5-rgb_front one of my favorite things to cook with in the fall time and it is fall where we are right now is spaghetti squash
2shrot4rypk_5-5-rgb_front spaghetti squash is really unique and different because it really absorbs the flavors of things that you put with it
2shrot4rypk_6-5-rgb_front so for this casserole we have first off baked our spaghetti squash and then we made kind of a cream egg and rosemary sun dried tomato mixture that we mixed in with our cooked spaghetti squash in a casserole dish
2shrot4rypk_7-5-rgb_front on top of that we went ahead and made some buttered pink crumbs along with some almonds and that is going to provide the really nice crust that you see there
2shrot4rypk_8-5-rgb_front i really like serving this dish because not a lot of people have tried spaghetti squash because it is a unique product
2shrot4rypk_9-5-rgb_front so go ahead and give it a try
2sk_fki9zog_0-3-rgb_front hi my name is dave andrews
2sk_fki9zog_1-3-rgb_front today i am going to tell you how to turn off calendar reminders in microsoft outlook
2sk_fki9zog_10-3-rgb_front as you can see it is very easy to turn off calendar reminders in microsoft outlook
2sk_fki9zog_11-3-rgb_front my name is dave andrews and i have just showed you how to turn off calendar reminders in microsoft outlook
2sk_fki9zog_2-3-rgb_front let is begin by opening up outlook by clicking on the start button on the bottom
2sk_fki9zog_3-3-rgb_front go into all programs under microsoft office let is select outlook
2sk_fki9zog_4-3-rgb_front now that we are in outlook let is go to tools and options and on this default reminder check box under calendar it is by default it is checked with a reminder of fifteen minutes
2sk_fki9zog_5-3-rgb_front just it and that turns off the default reminder to be set for all new calendar entries
2sk_fki9zog_6-3-rgb_front select apply
2sk_fki9zog_7-3-rgb_front let is open up our calendar and create a new item today at eleven of the clock
2sk_fki9zog_8-3-rgb_front you will notice that the reminder at the top is set to none
2sk_fki9zog_9-3-rgb_front since we that check box they will all be none from now on
2vaciospiwc_0-8-rgb_front hi
2vaciospiwc_10-8-rgb_front another thing to consider is on this toy it needs batteries
2vaciospiwc_11-8-rgb_front this has a screw making it so that the batteries can not pop out so this toy would be safe
2vaciospiwc_12-8-rgb_front however if it did not have the screw it would be dangerous for children because the batteries could pop out and they could put them in their mouth
2vaciospiwc_13-8-rgb_front you also need to make sure that the screw does stay in place and is tightened at all times
2vaciospiwc_14-8-rgb_front another thing to consider is checking to make sure there are not any sharp edges on the toy
2vaciospiwc_15-8-rgb_front this one has several sharp edges making it a dangerous toy for younger children
2vaciospiwc_16-8-rgb_front if you used for the appropriate age it would probably be okay
2vaciospiwc_2-8-rgb_front in this video clip i will show you how to check for dangerous parts on toys
2vaciospiwc_3-8-rgb_front one thing that can make a toy dangerous if it is part come off the toy
2vaciospiwc_4-8-rgb_front right here we have a pretend cake
2vaciospiwc_5-8-rgb_front this candle for instance pops right off so that could cause a choking hazard making it a dangerous toy
2vaciospiwc_6-8-rgb_front this toy has a cord on it making it a dangerous toy
2vaciospiwc_7-8-rgb_front the cord can cause the child to strangle them self
2vaciospiwc_8-8-rgb_front this toy would be okay for the appropriate age
2vaciospiwc_9-8-rgb_front however the cord would make it a dangerous toy for younger children
2wtwos8bf7a_0-3-rgb_front we have done the red lipstick on amalia in this little clip we are going to talk about the lip gloss
2wtwos8bf7a_1-3-rgb_front red lipstick is back in fashion but still i love lip gloss and i do not like to put the lip gloss right on the lips
2wtwos8bf7a_2-3-rgb_front so i try to clean everything really clean here i have these special that are tightly wound and so no fibers will get onto my lip gloss because you know lip gloss is really sticky
2wtwos8bf7a_3-3-rgb_front so once i get it on the little thing i am going to go ahead and put a little bit on her lips
2wtwos8bf7a_4-3-rgb_front it is okay to just kind of glob it on because i am going to go on again with the brush and even it out so i kind of apply it like that
2wtwos8bf7a_5-3-rgb_front then i get my lip brush and just lightly push it around the lips nice and even
2wtwos8bf7a_6-3-rgb_front you want to kind of keep it you do not want to push down too much you are basically just pushing that gloss around the lips
2wtwos8bf7a_7-3-rgb_front there you go so now she has the super glossy lips
2wtwos8bf7a_8-3-rgb_front we are going to almost be done with this makeup
2wt91-j_ddi_1-5-rgb_front as in the federal motor vehicles safety standard requires manufactures to put in some kind of locking magnetism on there seat belts so they can be used with child safety seats
2wt91-j_ddi_10-5-rgb_front it may or may not be enough to keep the belt locked on that steep in that case we have a thing known as a locking clip
2wt91-j_ddi_11-5-rgb_front the locking clip is always applied within a inch of a latch plate and a locking clip could be used with a belt that has no locking magnetism that is older then
2wt91-j_ddi_2-5-rgb_front the belt that i am holding here is a lap only belt this belt locks with a bar inside it that pulls when the belt buckle is parallel to the belt path itself
2wt91-j_ddi_3-5-rgb_front when it is turned perpendicular it releases and allows the belt to slide freely this is important because using it with a child is restraint
2wt91-j_ddi_4-5-rgb_front if you tighten it this way but in some cases depending on this starts and where this lines up if it actually lines up in the belt path like this it is not going to lock
2wt91-j_ddi_5-5-rgb_front so it is important that it will be the belt needs to be above the locking magnetism
2wt91-j_ddi_6-5-rgb_front another form of the belt that you would find is a lap shoulder belt most of these are freely and again as i said as in they made a prevision in these belts that would allow them to lock
2wt91-j_ddi_7-5-rgb_front the prevision on this belt is that you pull the belt slowly all the way out the belt then switches and if you can hear that it is ranching back in it remains lock until it retracts fully
2wt91-j_ddi_8_9-5-rgb_front you would find this on general motors product ford products and most imported cars chrysler uses what is known as a cinching latch plate the plate itself here at the latch has a siding number that locks it
2xnihz9qbsi_0-5-rgb_front okay the last curve we are going to look at is called the masse shot
2xnihz9qbsi_1-5-rgb_front now that is probably what you have heard other curve shots termed as masse shots i like to make a difference between a natural curve shot like those that we have already explored and what is really a full masse
2xnihz9qbsi_10-5-rgb_front so to do that we have to have an elevation on the cue that is pretty much vertical and know exactly where to hit the cue ball and exactly what speed to stroke it at in order to get it to do that
2xnihz9qbsi_11_12_13_14-5-rgb_front let is see what we can do with it whoo actually that is close enough as you can see i missed the shot which might give you an indication as to just how difficult they are to make
2xnihz9qbsi_15-5-rgb_front but once again i do want to reiterate that this is not a shot that you really need to try to practice a whole lot because it is not a dependable shot when you are using it in competition
2xnihz9qbsi_16-5-rgb_front it was just really here for demonstration purposes to show you what can be done with a cue ball
2xnihz9qbsi_17-5-rgb_front but this shot you really you need to leave that up to the trick shot artists that you see on tv
2xnihz9qbsi_2-5-rgb_front masse is just a french word as i said earlier this is a this game was derived by the french years and years ago
2xnihz9qbsi_3-5-rgb_front but the masse shot now is one where we are using a radical curve
2xnihz9qbsi_4-5-rgb_front we are going to take a full half circle around the ball
2xnihz9qbsi_5-5-rgb_front and i have got to tell you this is not a good shot for pool
2xnihz9qbsi_6-5-rgb_front it would be a very very rare occasion that you would have to use it
2xnihz9qbsi_7-5-rgb_front but the only reason that i would like to demonstrate it or at least how it is suppose to be make is just to show you again the difference between the level cue rule what we have to do to make this particular shot and some of the extreme action you can get on a cue ball if you know how to stroke it properly
2xnihz9qbsi_8-5-rgb_front so with our masse shot here
2xnihz9qbsi_9-5-rgb_front what we want to do is we would like to be able to curve this ball or masse this cue ball completely around that ball right there and pocket the ball
2xzcmikrn8y_0-5-rgb_front the next type of collar that you can use in your drawings would be a short point collar
2xzcmikrn8y_1-5-rgb_front what that means is literally the points are short short collar
2xzcmikrn8y_2-5-rgb_front the part of the collar that folds over there is the fold and then here is your collar
2xzcmikrn8y_3-5-rgb_front there short it is short as opposed to regular sized standard shirt collar
2xzcmikrn8y_4-5-rgb_front this is going to be used on if you are looking for a real world example of this it would be like in a woman is blouse that is leaning towards a more feminine look than the regular unisex oxford shirt that has a collar
2xzcmikrn8y_5-5-rgb_front hence this type of button i showed you before that this kind of button is going to be more of a feminine look too
2xzcmikrn8y_6-5-rgb_front when you have the actual button hole going vertically as opposed to horizontally it is always going to be horizontal on your regular button down collared shirts but when you turn it vertically it gives it a little bit more style not style it gives it another look to the whole overall design
2yrcf37jyli_0-8-rgb_front hi we are here to help you find great new colors for your skin tone
2yrcf37jyli_1-8-rgb_front so you have come to the right place
2yrcf37jyli_10-8-rgb_front remember if you can find a pallet like mine here that gives you an option of several different colors
2yrcf37jyli_11-8-rgb_front you have some warms you have some cools you have some darks
2yrcf37jyli_12-8-rgb_front test these products out on your skin and find the right colors to help you achieve the look that you want
2yrcf37jyli_13-8-rgb_front my name is sylvia russell and this is how you can choose colors for your skin tone
2yrcf37jyli_2-8-rgb_front my name is sylvia russell
2yrcf37jyli_3-8-rgb_front as you can see our model has fair skin very beautiful skin
2yrcf37jyli_4-8-rgb_front so we are not going to use colors that are over powering on the skin
2yrcf37jyli_5-8-rgb_front now when you have a light skin or cool tones think cool and when you think cool i think blue green colors that will help to compliment your skin tone
2yrcf37jyli_6-8-rgb_front it is important to know what your skin tone is so that you can choose the right color
2yrcf37jyli_7-8-rgb_front now again if you have cool skin or light skin then you can apply colors that are blue green nothing very very orange or warm
2yrcf37jyli_8-8-rgb_front if you have medium skin you may want to go with your taupes your peaches your creamy oranges nothing too too orange
2yrcf37jyli_9-8-rgb_front and if you have dark skin then you will want to go ahead and enhance the color with a brighter more vibrant shade
2z3cpaluo9o_0-8-rgb_front this is anthony and we are going to talk about cleaning photo negatives
2z3cpaluo9o_1-8-rgb_front first thing you want to do when your cleaning a negative is wear a glove
2z3cpaluo9o_10-8-rgb_front i want to clean this negative
2z3cpaluo9o_11-8-rgb_front right here is what is called a anti static cloth
2z3cpaluo9o_12-8-rgb_front in my opinion it is the best tool to use to clean negatives
2z3cpaluo9o_13-8-rgb_front i personally do not like using caned air
2z3cpaluo9o_14-8-rgb_front it is bad for the environment and a lot of times
2z3cpaluo9o_15-8-rgb_front i find out that can air almost spits out condensation and that can actually ruin my negative
2z3cpaluo9o_16-8-rgb_front so that is not good in my opinion
2z3cpaluo9o_17-8-rgb_front so i am going to use this cloth very simply i am going to fold the cloth over and clean the negative
2z3cpaluo9o_18-8-rgb_front negatives usually have water marks dust murks to some degree
2z3cpaluo9o_19-8-rgb_front scratches on them
2z3cpaluo9o_2-8-rgb_front it is kind of annoying
2z3cpaluo9o_20-8-rgb_front you want to avoid the scratches
2z3cpaluo9o_21-8-rgb_front everything else you can pretty much get off
2z3cpaluo9o_22-8-rgb_front if this does not work with the cloth i go to anti static film cleaner
2z3cpaluo9o_23-8-rgb_front the number one ingredient in all film cleaner
2z3cpaluo9o_24-8-rgb_front is isopropyl alcohol
2z3cpaluo9o_25-8-rgb_front in my studio i just have a bit vat of isopropyl alcohol that i use
2z3cpaluo9o_26-8-rgb_front i have had it for years a little alcohol isopropyl alcohol
2z3cpaluo9o_27-8-rgb_front on a cotton ball will clean almost any negative but i do like the film cleaner sometimes
2z3cpaluo9o_28-8-rgb_front there is a little bit extra ingredient in it
2z3cpaluo9o_29-8-rgb_front that just seems to work as a solvent a little bit better on my negatives
2z3cpaluo9o_3-8-rgb_front looks kind of silly but you know what
2z3cpaluo9o_30-8-rgb_front there are two sides to a negative
2z3cpaluo9o_31-8-rgb_front you have the emulsion side non emulsion side
2z3cpaluo9o_32-8-rgb_front you want be extremely careful with the emulsion side of your negative
2z3cpaluo9o_33-8-rgb_front that is the negative where layer of emulsion is on
2z3cpaluo9o_34-8-rgb_front that actually gets exposed to light and makes your image
2z3cpaluo9o_35-8-rgb_front if you scratch that
2z3cpaluo9o_36-8-rgb_front your basically going to have a negative that is going to have a scratch on it for life and your only going to be able to get that scratch off
2z3cpaluo9o_37-8-rgb_front via photo shop or a retouching job and that is starts to get very time consuming and very expensive
2z3cpaluo9o_38-8-rgb_front so always treat your negatives with the utmost care and again this is really the first step that i like to use
2z3cpaluo9o_39-8-rgb_front it is just this cloth
2z3cpaluo9o_4-8-rgb_front it really helps
2z3cpaluo9o_40-8-rgb_front they sell them at any photography store
2z3cpaluo9o_41-8-rgb_front it is an anti static cloth they cost about ten bucks max
2z3cpaluo9o_42-8-rgb_front so it is pretty affordable if you keep them in the little bag
2z3cpaluo9o_43-8-rgb_front they will last for years
2z3cpaluo9o_5-8-rgb_front you do not want to start cleaning something while your putting more dirt on what your cleaning
2z3cpaluo9o_6-8-rgb_front makes sense
2z3cpaluo9o_7-8-rgb_front this is a negative i have
2z3cpaluo9o_8-8-rgb_front two and a quarter black and white negative
2z3cpaluo9o_9-8-rgb_front has a fine layer of filth on the negative
2zosvpnbx5m_0-3-rgb_front the next thing i am going to talk about is fire safety
2zosvpnbx5m_1-3-rgb_front as you will see later on this grinder does throw quite a bunch of sparks
2zosvpnbx5m_10-3-rgb_front the sparks do end up on the floor sometimes they shoot out the back
2zosvpnbx5m_11-3-rgb_front you want to make sure there is no oily rags or paper that is going to catch on fire because the sparks that come off of here are pretty hot and if there is something to catch on fire it will catch on fire
2zosvpnbx5m_12-3-rgb_front and another thing you want to remember is this if you are doing this in an enclosed area like a garage or a shop make sure that it is properly ventilated and that you do not have cans of gasoline around where the fumes can accumulate on the floor because the sparks will end up down there
2zosvpnbx5m_13-3-rgb_front and it will start a massive fire and create a lot of destruction
2zosvpnbx5m_2-3-rgb_front that is why i have this bucket here
2zosvpnbx5m_3-3-rgb_front it allows the sparks most of the sparks to go into the water and settle to the bottom
2zosvpnbx5m_4-3-rgb_front also if for some reason a fire does start out and you do not have access to your fire extinguisher right close by though i do suggest that you have a fire extinguisher close by at all times
2zosvpnbx5m_5-3-rgb_front a good fire extinguisher to have is one that says abc so that it is good for trash and paper and wood as well as liquids and electrical fires
2zosvpnbx5m_6-3-rgb_front so it covers all the generals that you need
2zosvpnbx5m_7-3-rgb_front but also you have this bucket of water so that if something happens you have a bunch of water here that you can use
2zosvpnbx5m_8-3-rgb_front this water is also used to cool down the knives so that you do not burn your hands
2zosvpnbx5m_9-3-rgb_front the other thing that you want to make sure of is that you are not grinding next to flammable liquids
2_2wh7cfjlm_0-5-rgb_front quaker parakeets to catch in the wild is now basically illegal
2_2wh7cfjlm_1-5-rgb_front quakers are not native to the united states and import of wild life birds to the united states has been banned
2_2wh7cfjlm_2-5-rgb_front this is because that people who were catching the birds in the wild were using very cruel and inhumane manners to catch the these birds
2_2wh7cfjlm_3-5-rgb_front they would rob the birds nest and and while feeding the baby birds they did not know how to feed them or was not doing it properly and they were aspirating them
2_2wh7cfjlm_4-5-rgb_front over fifty percent of the birds died
2_2wh7cfjlm_5-5-rgb_front many of the birds that was caught in the wild were stressed and they also died
2_2wh7cfjlm_6-5-rgb_front the people that were catching the birds were doing it for the money
2_2wh7cfjlm_7-5-rgb_front they cared nothing about the bird
2_2wh7cfjlm_8-5-rgb_front nor about their longevity into a society
2_kmuauftxu_0-3-rgb_front here we have an off the shoulder sleeve
2_kmuauftxu_1-3-rgb_front which i guess technically may not be an actual sleeve
2_kmuauftxu_10-3-rgb_front which makes it not technically a sleeve
2_kmuauftxu_11-3-rgb_front but just go with it
2_kmuauftxu_12-3-rgb_front and we have it going off the shoulder
2_kmuauftxu_13-3-rgb_front and then remember always when you are trying to show dimension and show that it is to add that little back flip right there to show the back of the garment
2_kmuauftxu_14-3-rgb_front because if you are looking at an actual person you will be able to see parts of the backs of their clothes from the fronts three dimensional
2_kmuauftxu_15-3-rgb_front and then create the curve wherever you want it
2_kmuauftxu_16-3-rgb_front lower or higher
2_kmuauftxu_17-3-rgb_front whatever you want
2_kmuauftxu_2-3-rgb_front it might just be part of the shirt
2_kmuauftxu_3-3-rgb_front because i have my drawing as almost a rollover style
2_kmuauftxu_4-3-rgb_front like think bodysuits with the jean shorts that are cuffed
2_kmuauftxu_5-3-rgb_front and they come off the shoulders
2_kmuauftxu_6-3-rgb_front they are spandex
2_kmuauftxu_7-3-rgb_front that is what i was trying to represent here
2_kmuauftxu_8-3-rgb_front but the sleeve is whatever part of the fabric is or the garment is on the arms
2_kmuauftxu_9-3-rgb_front so therefore part of your sleeve is attached in here to the bodice of the actual shirt
2b7ogpplaum_0-5-rgb_front hi im geeta a beauty therapist and hairdresser from india
2b7ogpplaum_10-5-rgb_front now let us take martha clay masks
2b7ogpplaum_11-5-rgb_front these are great for the oily type of skin as this absorbs the excess oil from the skin without disturbing the moisture level of the skin which is very important in using any type of mask
2b7ogpplaum_12-5-rgb_front now this also blurt the shiness from the oily skin apart from this it constrict the pores and also remove the dead skin cells from the skin
2b7ogpplaum_13-5-rgb_front now let us come to the exfoliating mask
2b7ogpplaum_14-5-rgb_front now the exfoliation action itself suggests that it removes the surface debris from the skin which means the dead layers of the skin are remove with the help of the exfoliating actions and this gives the skin in their difficult condition
2b7ogpplaum_15-5-rgb_front this mask are also helpful in enormous skin types as enormous skin also sometimes suffer from dullness and sometimes with blackheads
2b7ogpplaum_16-5-rgb_front now comes the peel off mask which are great for any type of skin as they refresh the oily areas and nourish the dry skin
2b7ogpplaum_2-5-rgb_front now let us say the easily available products in the market are the face packs
2b7ogpplaum_3-5-rgb_front now these masks are very easy to get ready from the market and use at home
2b7ogpplaum_4-5-rgb_front let us talk about the moisturizing mask
2b7ogpplaum_5-5-rgb_front the moisturizing name itself suggests that it moisturizes the skin and is meant for dry type of skin
2b7ogpplaum_6-5-rgb_front as dry skin has patchiness dullness on the skin and dead cells on the skin
2b7ogpplaum_7-5-rgb_front so this mask gives moisture retention to the skin
2b7ogpplaum_8-5-rgb_front apart from this it also removes dry flakes from the skin and the fine lines
2b7ogpplaum_9-5-rgb_front in short it helps in the cell metabolism of this type of skin
2bmqgjtwp3g_0-8-rgb_front hi i am richard fields and in this clip we are going to talk about how to buy a back packing sleeping bag
2bmqgjtwp3g_1-8-rgb_front there are two basic kinds of bags in terms of how they are built
2bmqgjtwp3g_10-8-rgb_front you are certainly going to want to buy a bag that will completely cover your shoulders and over your head
2bmqgjtwp3g_11-8-rgb_front if you are a side sleeper it is not as critical if you tend to sleep on your back or your stomach then you definitely have to have a bag that is long enough for you
2bmqgjtwp3g_12-8-rgb_front when purchasing a sleeping bag it is to your advantage to go to a pro shop
2bmqgjtwp3g_13-8-rgb_front they can help you get the right bag and the right fit at the right temperature for you and that is how to buy a sleeping bag
2bmqgjtwp3g_2-8-rgb_front one is made with synthetic material and the other is made with down
2bmqgjtwp3g_3-8-rgb_front the down bag is lighter warmer but if you are going to be in any kind of wet climate or in any danger of getting that bag wet wet down is useless and takes forever to dry
2bmqgjtwp3g_4-8-rgb_front the synthetic bag will continue to keep you warm even when wet although it is not as compressible and it is a little heavier
2bmqgjtwp3g_5-8-rgb_front mummy bags those are the form fitted bags have less air space in them and therefore will keep you warmer
2bmqgjtwp3g_6-8-rgb_front they are more restrictive but they tend to be warmer and lighter
2bmqgjtwp3g_7-8-rgb_front things to consider of course is what kind of temperatures are you going to be encountering
2bmqgjtwp3g_8-8-rgb_front it is better to buy a bag that is a little too warm than one that is not warm enough
2bmqgjtwp3g_9-8-rgb_front an additional thing to consider is how tall you are
2c0pn0egeja_1-5-rgb_front this step i am going to talk to you about making the bail on your pendant
2c0pn0egeja_2-5-rgb_front now to make the bail on your pendant you need to have your cold seal attached here to the bottom of the pendant and take your i am going to use a clear borosilicate rod you can use any sort of rod color or clear but it has to be a solid rod
2c0pn0egeja_3-5-rgb_front now i am going to get the tip of this started and get it hot then i am going to connect it towards the front side of the pendant that i want
2c0pn0egeja_4-5-rgb_front this will be the front therefore i am going to connect it to closer to this side
2c0pn0egeja_5-5-rgb_front we will get this hot and we will connect it
2c0pn0egeja_6-5-rgb_front now we are going to try and work that in with the glass so it is got a nice and solid connection with the pendant
2c0pn0egeja_7-5-rgb_front now now that that is connected as you can see there we are going to get the glass hot and gradually we are going to pull out towards the front of the pendant a little bit of twisting with my right hand there now we are going to heat the rod and try and arc it backwards into the bail
2c0pn0egeja_8-5-rgb_front a little twisting we connect it with the back of the pendant now we are going to detach the clear rod
2c0pn0egeja_9-5-rgb_front now we are going to heat this up and i am going to use my mashers again to get the bail in the position that i want
2ckgjvdgnye_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is elliot
2ckgjvdgnye_10-8-rgb_front take a piece of tape tear it off and tape them together
2ckgjvdgnye_11-8-rgb_front if it is too short you can get more tape
2ckgjvdgnye_12-8-rgb_front so what is so important about getting the tape at the end of the straws
2ckgjvdgnye_13-8-rgb_front well let me tell you
2ckgjvdgnye_14-8-rgb_front if you put the tape in the middle then the ends of the straws can sway back and forth and therefore you do not get as better aiming when you are shooting your straw
2ckgjvdgnye_15-8-rgb_front so make sure that you put the tape near the end and near the other end okay
2ckgjvdgnye_16-8-rgb_front next what you want to do is chew two spit balls for the double cannon
2ckgjvdgnye_17-8-rgb_front i have two in my mouth
2ckgjvdgnye_18-8-rgb_front so load the first one and load the second one in the other cannon
2ckgjvdgnye_19-8-rgb_front it is getting a little tough
2ckgjvdgnye_2-8-rgb_front this is how you can make a double barrel gun
2ckgjvdgnye_20-8-rgb_front next you aim and you shoot
2ckgjvdgnye_21-8-rgb_front and let is see how this goes
2ckgjvdgnye_22-8-rgb_front wow they are so close together
2ckgjvdgnye_23-8-rgb_front that shows how accurate they can be
2ckgjvdgnye_3-8-rgb_front okay so what you are going to need is two straws preferably the same kind
2ckgjvdgnye_4-8-rgb_front and you are also going to need tape
2ckgjvdgnye_5-8-rgb_front what you will want to do first is take the two straws and try to align them about the same
2ckgjvdgnye_6-8-rgb_front next what you want to do put your finger on that place take the tape and take a bit of tape
2ckgjvdgnye_7-8-rgb_front go back to where you aligned them and try to tape them together
2ckgjvdgnye_8-8-rgb_front it is important that you tape them up close to the end
2ckgjvdgnye_9-8-rgb_front and you switch it to the other side
2ftokltjdmm_1-1-rgb_front we are going to talk about what happens when your car battery dies how to select a new battery and how to see what the problem is
2ftokltjdmm_10-1-rgb_front the side post terminal will be a round flat piece of copper like a washer with a cable extending from it and bolt through into the battery on the side or the top
2ftokltjdmm_11-1-rgb_front most newer cars have a bolt in terminal
2ftokltjdmm_12-1-rgb_front most older cars have a clamp style
2ftokltjdmm_13-1-rgb_front the clamp style is more prone to rust and corrosion
2ftokltjdmm_14-1-rgb_front but just by wiggling this i found the loose terminal
2ftokltjdmm_15-1-rgb_front and that is going to cause a problem
2ftokltjdmm_16-1-rgb_front and if a terminal is loose it will also encourage corrosion to grow
2ftokltjdmm_17-1-rgb_front and if corrosion starts it starts corroding the battery tray under the car and it will eat down into the wire
2ftokltjdmm_18-1-rgb_front sometimes you can find corrosion inside one of your battery cables by using a razor and slicing open the rubber shielding on the cable
2ftokltjdmm_19-1-rgb_front and you will recognize a greenish color to the copper wire strands
2ftokltjdmm_2-1-rgb_front okay here is the car battery in this particular car
2ftokltjdmm_20-1-rgb_front and you will see a white powdery stuff
2ftokltjdmm_21-1-rgb_front and if you flex the cable we can bend the cable once we take the terminal off
2ftokltjdmm_22-1-rgb_front and if it feels crunchy inside that is a sign that the cable needs to be replaced or maybe just cut off a few inches to where there is clean copper inside and then clamp a new terminal end on it
2ftokltjdmm_23_24-1-rgb_front the corrosion does not look too bad on the battery terminals or in the wire strands if you notice any corrosion on the battery such as this white powdery stuff or rusty looking stuff you can clean it off and neutralize it neutralize the acid with a mixture of water and baking soda
2ftokltjdmm_25-1-rgb_front you simply pour it over the battery and it will foam up and then you can rinse it off with clean water
2ftokltjdmm_26-1-rgb_front a little water around the battery will usually drain off onto the ground without causing any problem to under hood components
2ftokltjdmm_27_28-1-rgb_front but make sure you do not pour it into the fuse box so first let is clean these terminals and reconnect the battery nice and tight and then see if we get any power out of the car see if the headlights come on see if the starter will turn the engine
2ftokltjdmm_29-1-rgb_front i am going to get a wire brush and clean these terminals
2ftokltjdmm_3-1-rgb_front some cars will have the battery in different locations
2ftokltjdmm_4-1-rgb_front a volkswagon beetle will have a car battery under the seat in the back of the car
2ftokltjdmm_5_6-1-rgb_front most cars now have them under the hood easiest to service out of the passenger compartment we are going to check for dirty terminals rust and maybe loose connections
2ftokltjdmm_7_8-1-rgb_front and we are going to see if we can get this battery to work first thing i am looking for is white corrosion in the connecting areas where the cable terminal next to the battery itself
2ftokltjdmm_9-1-rgb_front so some batteries have a side post which means that the connecting contact point is on the side of the battery
2fthetryq7c_1-3-rgb_front i am going to be talking about different gift ideas for a
2fthetryq7c_2-3-rgb_front another gag gift that you could get a would be a dart board with a picture of say your boss on it if you do not like him very much
2fthetryq7c_3-3-rgb_front or you can even get that gift for your boss
2fthetryq7c_4-3-rgb_front if he is a very humorous guy he would probably think that was a very funny gift
2fthetryq7c_5-3-rgb_front it would be even funnier if you had your picture on it
2fthetryq7c_6-3-rgb_front now a way you can actually make this gag gift would be just buy a dart board from the nearest store that you can find it from and get the picture made
2fthetryq7c_7-3-rgb_front tag it on there and just do whatever you can do make it stay on there and it would be just a very humorous gift to give to everyone
2hpqumoiuu8_0-5-rgb_front okay first we are going to need a lump of clay for the house itself
2hpqumoiuu8_1-5-rgb_front i used between two and a half and three pounds of clay on that one so i am going to cut another piece about that size
2hpqumoiuu8_2-5-rgb_front that is right at about three pounds and that is perfect
2hpqumoiuu8_3-5-rgb_front pat this into a nice good ball
2hpqumoiuu8_4-5-rgb_front it always helps centering to make your piece into a nice good ball before you start
2hpqumoiuu8_5-5-rgb_front now next the lid it is a similar amount of clay probably closer to two and a half pounds and look there we happen to have it
2hpqumoiuu8_6-5-rgb_front so we will pat that into a ball as well
2hpqumoiuu8_7-5-rgb_front and finally we need some clay for this knob that we are going to make
2hpqumoiuu8_8-5-rgb_front i do not weigh clay for the knobs
2hpqumoiuu8_9-5-rgb_front i usually just take my hand and make a fist into the clay and that is the perfect amount of clay for a knob like that and we are ready to start throwing
2i72vxkujas_0-5-rgb_front then we have another oblong brush
2i72vxkujas_1-5-rgb_front again it is the wooden variety
2i72vxkujas_10-5-rgb_front a large pin brush is not a problem but this might be a large brush if we are working on a havanais or a yorkie
2i72vxkujas_11-5-rgb_front so if this comfortably in your hand remember that the handle is going to be shorter as well
2i72vxkujas_12-5-rgb_front you can see that here but if this fits comfortably in your hand this is a nice brush to use on a smaller breed dog
2i72vxkujas_13-5-rgb_front how do you use a pin brush on a long coated dog
2i72vxkujas_14-5-rgb_front pin brush is a great finishing type of brush
2i72vxkujas_15-5-rgb_front it goes right over nicely over the coat
2i72vxkujas_16-5-rgb_front it is not a really tough brush
2i72vxkujas_17-5-rgb_front it does not pull out a lot of hair you can see there is not a lot of hair
2i72vxkujas_18-5-rgb_front it is really better to be used as a finishing brush
2i72vxkujas_19-5-rgb_front it is not a good brush to take mats out
2i72vxkujas_2-5-rgb_front it is in a padded base as well
2i72vxkujas_20-5-rgb_front so if you are trying to get undercoat out and trying to take mats out this is not the brush you would want to use
2i72vxkujas_21-5-rgb_front you would wind up bending the pins and pulling them out
2i72vxkujas_22-5-rgb_front this is a brush you would use after you have gone over the entire dog with your slicker type brush and then you would use your pin brush as a finishing type brush
2i72vxkujas_3-5-rgb_front this is a shorter brush so it is shorter than the other oblong i was showing you
2i72vxkujas_4-5-rgb_front this is a great brush if you are just showing your dog and you need to take a brush into the ring
2i72vxkujas_5-5-rgb_front this is smaller
2i72vxkujas_6-5-rgb_front this is a great brush to take into the ring with you
2i72vxkujas_7-5-rgb_front this is also a nice brush to work on a small breed dog
2i72vxkujas_8-5-rgb_front again we are using an example here of a large breed dog
2i72vxkujas_9-5-rgb_front we are still working on pin brush with a large breed dog
2ifx_ur3gbq_0-1-rgb_front hi my name is guillermo gomez i coach soccer
2ifx_ur3gbq_1-1-rgb_front have you ever seen a goalie kick the ball
2ifx_ur3gbq_11-1-rgb_front the ball is going to touch the ground
2ifx_ur3gbq_12-1-rgb_front and as soon as that ball touches the ground you are going to kick that ball making your body lean backwards and not forward
2ifx_ur3gbq_13-1-rgb_front you want to look at the area of the ball which is basically the lower section of the ball
2ifx_ur3gbq_14-1-rgb_front that is the area you are going to be kicking and it needs to be right about the middle o k
2ifx_ur3gbq_15-1-rgb_front you want to lock your ankles that is very important lock the ankle point your toes down and kick it with your shoelace
2ifx_ur3gbq_16-1-rgb_front alright so to summarize it we do it again
2ifx_ur3gbq_17-1-rgb_front you want to put the ball with one hand o k right about the waist size of the waist elevation or area of your body
2ifx_ur3gbq_18-1-rgb_front put the ball in front of you take about three steps with it drop the ball o k
2ifx_ur3gbq_19-1-rgb_front and as soon as the ball touch the ground o k your supporting leg comes right next to it a little bit behind it so bring your body back shoelaces and toes pointing down kick the ball underneath and send it nice along
2ifx_ur3gbq_2-1-rgb_front well he actually bounces on the ground first and then he kicks it far away to his teammates towards the middle of the soccer field
2ifx_ur3gbq_20-1-rgb_front and that is how you can do a drop kick a goalie drop kick
2ifx_ur3gbq_21-1-rgb_front so fun out there with your friends while you practice this kick
2ifx_ur3gbq_3-1-rgb_front that is what you call a goalie drop kick
2ifx_ur3gbq_4-1-rgb_front o k
2ifx_ur3gbq_5-1-rgb_front so today i am going to be explaining how to do that
2ifx_ur3gbq_6-1-rgb_front first if all you know you are the goalie
2ifx_ur3gbq_7-1-rgb_front you normally want to get comfortable with the ball so what you can do is just take a few bounces on the ball with your hands so bounce the ball down about two or three times o k
2ifx_ur3gbq_8-1-rgb_front then you want to put the ball with one hand right about in the west in your west area waist i am sorry in the waist area
2ifx_ur3gbq_9_10-1-rgb_front o k now put the ball in front of you o k you are going to take about three steps going forward and then you are going to be dropping the ball o k
2iooczfiwwu_1-5-rgb_front now that we have got our first three strings on our low e string a string and d string
2iooczfiwwu_10-5-rgb_front now we are going to put our g string on same thing as before put it in that slot on the tail piece
2iooczfiwwu_11-5-rgb_front the string goes through the saddle the groove in the saddle there
2iooczfiwwu_12-5-rgb_front we are going to take this up to the top tuning peg once again you want to hole ninety degrees and we are going to slide it in from the inside
2iooczfiwwu_13-5-rgb_front it is the same as this side just kind of the opposite motion
2iooczfiwwu_14-5-rgb_front leave a little slack wrap it around and underneath pull it tight hold it tight pull it up make sure it is sitting in the groove with the nut and tighten
2iooczfiwwu_15-5-rgb_front i am going to finish up these strings and then i will take you to the next step
2iooczfiwwu_2-5-rgb_front i am going to show you i am going to have to flip the guitar around to do this side
2iooczfiwwu_3-5-rgb_front it is almost the same it is kind of the opposite motion
2iooczfiwwu_4-5-rgb_front some guitars you do not have to worry about this problem
2iooczfiwwu_5-5-rgb_front on this guitar which is a gibson typically the tuning pegs there s three on one side and three on the other side of the headstock
2iooczfiwwu_6-5-rgb_front on a fender guitar they will all be on one side so you really will not have to worry about this step
2iooczfiwwu_7-5-rgb_front to do the g string b string and high e string i am going to move to this side because it just makes it a little easier
2iooczfiwwu_8-5-rgb_front i am going to start with the g string by the way it is important to know in case you do not that from the top of the guitar down you want to make sure you get the right strings in the right spot
2iooczfiwwu_9-5-rgb_front it is low e string a string d string g string b and high e string
2koozjewaky_0-8-rgb_front coming into palming her arm and this is the one the side poses
2koozjewaky_1-8-rgb_front so first thing i want to do is get her on her side
2koozjewaky_10-8-rgb_front and i am not what i am kind of doing is pressing down down down give her a little stretch and still leaning against her slightly keep that connection and again palming towards the middle out out
2koozjewaky_11-8-rgb_front here walk it out and literally hand to the wrist hand to the shoulder lengthen that arm
2koozjewaky_12-8-rgb_front perfect
2koozjewaky_2-8-rgb_front pillow about middle of the hip right here move your hand in the garment just a little bit so you would be comfortable grab a hold of the back of the leg gently twist her over and we want her to come all the way on to her side
2koozjewaky_3-8-rgb_front oh her neck looks very uncomfortable
2koozjewaky_4-8-rgb_front so what we are going to do ask her to lift her head place something underneath the head a blanket a pillow anything that you have got to help your client feel comfortable
2koozjewaky_5-8-rgb_front i am going to come in to a nice kneeling diamond here and i am rarely leaning into her give her a little bit of control lengthening that arm
2koozjewaky_6-8-rgb_front now if you have got someone that is really really tiny and you got a nice little gap right here you want to place a pillow or blanket right there too to keep your client comfortable
2koozjewaky_7-8-rgb_front i want to start right here towards the elbows gently press down with the palm and work it way up
2koozjewaky_8-8-rgb_front you can give about three times
2koozjewaky_9-8-rgb_front start right back towards the elbow and again palming

2lxxvitxhms_5-5-rgb_front what really does not look good though is when you are in the process of doing your audition if you stop yourself in the middle then entire audition stops
2lxxvitxhms_6-5-rgb_front that is something that you do not want to do so please make sure when you are in the process of your actual audition you just keep going
2lxxvitxhms_7-5-rgb_front if you make a little mistake it is okay we understand it is not for production it is only an audition

2nocltvz-0w_0-8-rgb_front okay great
2nocltvz-0w_1-8-rgb_front hi my name is sylvia russell and today we are going to give you some tips on how to make home remedies for circles and puffiness
2nocltvz-0w_11_12_13-8-rgb_front did you stay up late last night did you have fun at a party these are all ways to have to wake up with a puffy eye
2nocltvz-0w_14-8-rgb_front so remember if you have eye puffiness make sure and use cold compresses cucumbers great things that you can find at home
2nocltvz-0w_15-8-rgb_front my name is sylvia russell and this is how you can use home remedies to get rid of eye puffiness and under eye circles
2nocltvz-0w_2-8-rgb_front now the first thing you want to remember is you want to always be careful about what you use on your eye area
2nocltvz-0w_3-8-rgb_front the eye area is very sensitive so we do not want to use anything that is going to damage or irritate the eye
2nocltvz-0w_4_5-8-rgb_front one tip for circles or puffiness is to use a cold compress take a washcloth wet it down with some water and put it in your freezer for a few minutes
2nocltvz-0w_6-8-rgb_front then once it is done lay it on your eyes for five to ten minutes giving yourself a little mini eye mask
2nocltvz-0w_7_8-8-rgb_front this is a great way to take any puffiness that has accumulated around the eye another great way to reduce eye puffiness is to cut some cucumbers that have been in the refrigerator and place these on the eye
2nocltvz-0w_9_10-8-rgb_front these are a great way to reduce eye puffiness but it also looks very another remedy is to make sure that you analyze the eye very well and figure out the reason why you may be puffy or why you may have circles
2oiji5k0n44_0_1-5-rgb_front we are continuing now with the traveling step all of these variations has a little bit of a of a traveling to two sides
2oiji5k0n44_10-5-rgb_front walking back up forward sweep
2oiji5k0n44_11-5-rgb_front walk back sweep
2oiji5k0n44_12-5-rgb_front walk up sweep
2oiji5k0n44_13-5-rgb_front sweep
2oiji5k0n44_14-5-rgb_front walk to the right look right look forward sweep and sweep
2oiji5k0n44_15-5-rgb_front walking back forward easy walk relaxed continuing to breath deeply as you sweep that leg across and sweep
2oiji5k0n44_16-5-rgb_front and walking back last one ahh
2oiji5k0n44_17-5-rgb_front traveling walk knee sweep
2oiji5k0n44_2_3-5-rgb_front traveling front to back and traveling to the side adding in the knee sweep so we begin drawing all the attention to your right side and we walk up and we sweep the left knee and we walk back sweep the right knee
2oiji5k0n44_4-5-rgb_front now we walk to the right look right sweep the left knee
2oiji5k0n44_5-5-rgb_front walk back sweep the right knee
2oiji5k0n44_6-5-rgb_front come back up sweep the right
2oiji5k0n44_7-5-rgb_front walk back three steps sweep
2oiji5k0n44_8-5-rgb_front walk sweep
2oiji5k0n44_9-5-rgb_front sweep
2ou9ea0ggsa_0-8-rgb_front now in this segment we are going to talk about doing a front roll but instead of having the frisbee right side up it is actually going to be upside down
2ou9ea0ggsa_1-8-rgb_front we call that inverted
2ou9ea0ggsa_10-8-rgb_front the inverted roll can also be done with a lot of angle this way or it also can be done from a front roll to an inverted roll
2ou9ea0ggsa_2-8-rgb_front now there is several different ways you can do that
2ou9ea0ggsa_3-8-rgb_front actually some people find this roll to be easier than the right side up roll
2ou9ea0ggsa_4-8-rgb_front with this one now the weight is on the bottom of the frisbee
2ou9ea0ggsa_5-8-rgb_front so you have to be kind of aware of that and again you want to start out by holding the frisbee here
2ou9ea0ggsa_6-8-rgb_front do a half a roll first and then you can do three quarters of a roll and then you can do a full roll
2ou9ea0ggsa_7-8-rgb_front now again you have to be nice and loose and have that frisbee touch every single part of your arm
2ou9ea0ggsa_8-8-rgb_front you can also do the inverted roll coming up your arms and then back down the other side and if you notice i am leaning back and then coming forward again leaning back coming forward again leaning back coming forward again
2ou9ea0ggsa_9-8-rgb_front that is the inverted roll
2p_xej6ul5u_0-5-rgb_front are you trekking around eastern europe
2p_xej6ul5u_1-5-rgb_front is bulgaria your main destination
2p_xej6ul5u_10-5-rgb_front what do you have to do
2p_xej6ul5u_11-5-rgb_front it is really easy
2p_xej6ul5u_12-5-rgb_front first of all you have to dial the international access code which is
2p_xej6ul5u_13-5-rgb_front secondly the country code of bulgaria going to be follow this number which is
2p_xej6ul5u_14-5-rgb_front and thirdly remove the zero from the city code and dial the remaining numbers
2p_xej6ul5u_15-5-rgb_front and last but not least you should dial the four to eight digits which remain which is your personal phone number
2p_xej6ul5u_2-5-rgb_front then you really have to make a phone call to make reservations there
2p_xej6ul5u_3-5-rgb_front first of all i have to tell you that you are really lucky in case you get a fairly clear connection with bulgaria and you are not disconnected while talking
2p_xej6ul5u_4-5-rgb_front secondly we have to admit that the westernization has not brought much modernization to bulgaria yet
2p_xej6ul5u_5-5-rgb_front so that is why they do not really have a developed phone system
2p_xej6ul5u_6-5-rgb_front but all in all first of all the thing you have to do in order to call bulgaria is to determine what time it is in bulgaria
2p_xej6ul5u_7-5-rgb_front bulgaria is two hours ahead of greenwich mean time
2p_xej6ul5u_8-5-rgb_front it means that it is seven hours later in bulgaria than it is on the east coast of the united states
2p_xej6ul5u_9-5-rgb_front and ten hours later than it is on the west coast of the united states
2q5qgvs_7wo_0-8-rgb_front ok so now that you know your set up you got it all written down maybe to help you remember
2q5qgvs_7wo_1-8-rgb_front the next thing that would not be a bad idea for you to write down a list of questions or concerns that you have with your fish tank
2q5qgvs_7wo_10-8-rgb_front it does not cause any unnecessarily bad things
2q5qgvs_7wo_11-8-rgb_front in fact it can help keep the tank a little bit more cleaner
2q5qgvs_7wo_12-8-rgb_front but you do want to watch out for any diseased fish
2q5qgvs_7wo_13-8-rgb_front take a close look
2q5qgvs_7wo_14-8-rgb_front see if anybody has any strange fungus or bumps growing on them if they are swimming erratically or strangely
2q5qgvs_7wo_15-8-rgb_front these are all clues to fish tanks or a fish store that maybe is not keeping their fish in the toppest condition
2q5qgvs_7wo_2-8-rgb_front and then we are going to head off to our local fish dealer
2q5qgvs_7wo_3-8-rgb_front i would also suggest you take along a water sample a small container with your water out of your tank so that your local fish dealer can test that water for you and let you know some of the parameters in it like your ph your ammonias and your nitrites and things like that
2q5qgvs_7wo_4-8-rgb_front that way they can help you pick a fish a little bit more clearly
2q5qgvs_7wo_5-8-rgb_front now when you are in your local fish store and maybe you only have one but hopefully you will have a couple to choose from you want to make sure you are looking at the tanks and you are seeing tanks that are clean and well cared for
2q5qgvs_7wo_6-8-rgb_front what we are looking for here is dead fish or builds up of grime in the aquarium
2q5qgvs_7wo_7-8-rgb_front algae i would not worry about too much about
2q5qgvs_7wo_8-8-rgb_front algae is part of an aquarium
2q5qgvs_7wo_9-8-rgb_front it is just a plant
2qyc4paw72o_0-8-rgb_front hi this sean hobson and right now we are working with our centers
2qyc4paw72o_1-8-rgb_front one important thing that we want our centers to learn is they are not always going to stand down on the low block and post
2qyc4paw72o_10-8-rgb_front flash to the high post now he turns and faces up
2qyc4paw72o_11-8-rgb_front he is either now got the option if he turns and no defenders on him or if they just close out like this he can either shoot it he can drive it or he can pass to the additional players
2qyc4paw72o_12-8-rgb_front but that is how we effectively flash up to the high post
2qyc4paw72o_2-8-rgb_front some point in time the high post area which is all this post area up here is going to be open
2qyc4paw72o_3-8-rgb_front a lot of times in the zone this whole entire area up here opens up or sometimes within the motion offense people vacate this area and if a post player will step up here they can get a pass
2qyc4paw72o_4-8-rgb_front now if you have got a good shooting center that can come up and flash in the high post get the ball turn and score
2qyc4paw72o_5-8-rgb_front so what we are going to have ben show and demonstrate right now is how it looks first of all when you flash to the high post then when you get the ball in the high post you want to catch and immediately turn and face the basket to see if you are either going to dump down off a pass or if you are going to shoot the ball
2qyc4paw72o_6-8-rgb_front this is what it looks like to flash to the high post
2qyc4paw72o_7-8-rgb_front go
2qyc4paw72o_8-8-rgb_front ball ball ball ball
2qyc4paw72o_9-8-rgb_front good
2qocwx8znpc_0-5-rgb_front now one of the very last things that you want to do and possibly the very last thing you want to do is to go and check your mailbox to make sure that you do not have any mail
2qocwx8znpc_1-5-rgb_front so i found this in my mailbox
2qocwx8znpc_2-5-rgb_front so make sure you check your mailbox and then and then also if you are renting a place make sure that you return the key
2qocwx8znpc_3-5-rgb_front so i have an agreement with my landlord that i am just going to put the key in an envelope and i have already paid my rent for the month
2qocwx8znpc_4-5-rgb_front although that is something else that you might need to include depending on what the what your agreement with your landlord is
2qocwx8znpc_5-5-rgb_front and then i will just we he knows that i am going to be leaving this in his mailbox which is right next to mine
2qocwx8znpc_6-5-rgb_front so that is that is probably the last thing that you need to do at this place
2qocwx8znpc_7-5-rgb_front at at your old place is just make sure that you have gotten all of your mail and your landlord has his or her key back
2sj9mg1qsbs_0-5-rgb_front his this is liz muller from liz is hair design in hollywood florida
2sj9mg1qsbs_1-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to show you how to select hair care products
2sj9mg1qsbs_10-5-rgb_front this one is really light i do not like anything too hard on the hair
2sj9mg1qsbs_11-5-rgb_front you can comb it out
2sj9mg1qsbs_12-5-rgb_front and if you have really fine hair and you want something to stay hard then you might want to use a firm hold
2sj9mg1qsbs_13-5-rgb_front this is liz muller and this is how you select hair care products
2sj9mg1qsbs_2-5-rgb_front we have all different types of hair care products and this does not only have to do with shampoo and conditioner ok you might want to use a hydrating cream for your hair
2sj9mg1qsbs_3-5-rgb_front it is like a leave in and the moroccan oil company has a beautiful and brilliant hair styling cream that puts the shine and it actually treats the hair while you roll or set it or blow dry it and it conditions that hair really nicely also
2sj9mg1qsbs_4-5-rgb_front you have also singdellino that has crystalli liquid and this is fabulous actually
2sj9mg1qsbs_5-5-rgb_front this liquid right here actually adds shine to the hair leaving the hair soft and it is wonderful
2sj9mg1qsbs_6-5-rgb_front you can actually put a little bit in the damp hair sometimes
2sj9mg1qsbs_7-5-rgb_front i do when i blow dry but you can use it for every day and it does not leave the hair oily
2sj9mg1qsbs_8-5-rgb_front you can actually use it on straight hair they have a spray that is really light and that you can spray on the hair and it leaves a shine in the hair
2sj9mg1qsbs_9-5-rgb_front we have wonderful hair sprays
2sautzuaqhg_0-5-rgb_front hi i am amelia and i am going to show you how to cut hair with clipper over comb technique
2sautzuaqhg_1-5-rgb_front first you take your comb and you figure out exactly what angle you want cause how you angle the comb is how much is going to come off so if you angle it out towards you you are only going to take a little bit less hair if you bring it straight up you will be taking a lot more hair and of course if you angle it in you are going to be taking quite a bit of hair
2sautzuaqhg_2-5-rgb_front you do not need a guard on your comb on your clipper so you can take your guard off
2sautzuaqhg_3-5-rgb_front clipper over comb is mostly used to get those little stragglies where it is uneven
2sautzuaqhg_4-5-rgb_front so you just take the comb i like to angle it towards me most of the time because you can always take more hair off you can not put it back on
2sautzuaqhg_5-5-rgb_front and just run it as straight as you can steady hands and just run it right over as close to the comb as you need to get it the closer you get to the comb of course the shorter the hair
2sautzuaqhg_6-5-rgb_front and that is how you use clipper over comb technique
2t0by_re108_0-8-rgb_front now i want to talk to you a little bit about your microwave
2t0by_re108_1-8-rgb_front a lot of people know how to use their microwave but there is a bunch of i guess little settings in there that some people just may not know how to use
2t0by_re108_10-8-rgb_front that is why some things come out dry in the microwave
2t0by_re108_11-8-rgb_front then we have our start and we have our clear of course if anything was timed onto our microwave
2t0by_re108_12-8-rgb_front a lot of microwaves on the top which is right here on this unit is we have a bunch of presets
2t0by_re108_13-8-rgb_front these are things that of course will be used the most
2t0by_re108_14-8-rgb_front if you are going to make popcorn go ahead and throw your popcorn in there and just press the popcorn button
2t0by_re108_15-8-rgb_front it will actually adjust to your popcorn and try to pop it perfect
2t0by_re108_16-8-rgb_front of course you want to reheat some coffee or things like that
2t0by_re108_17-8-rgb_front your reheat you can go ahead and go in and it will be timed for things that are either frozen or for things that just want to be reheated like if you just have a pizza that you have had i guess what is on your kitchen counter for a day or two and you just want to reheat it
2t0by_re108_18-8-rgb_front that is for all the college guys out there
2t0by_re108_19-8-rgb_front and then of course you have your time cook
2t0by_re108_2-8-rgb_front of course this is just a standard microwave right here
2t0by_re108_20-8-rgb_front this one you will click here and this is where you can actually type in how long you want it to be
2t0by_re108_21-8-rgb_front so i want it to be minute and seconds long for instance
2t0by_re108_22-8-rgb_front so i will go ahead and hit clear
2t0by_re108_23-8-rgb_front we have potato
2t0by_re108_24-8-rgb_front this is good for your baked potatoes and so on and so forth
2t0by_re108_25-8-rgb_front if you hit auto defrost it will ask you to enter the weight of the item that you are going to be defrosting
2t0by_re108_26-8-rgb_front if your clock is not working right now it is here if it is not working you can click that and then you will go ahead and type in what time it is
2t0by_re108_27-8-rgb_front some other good features the inside of every single microwave there is usually a sticker whether it is on the top or the side wherever it may be these are all your other settings
2t0by_re108_28-8-rgb_front these will let you know exactly how long your presets are going to be and any other major settings you are allowed to change with your microwave
2t0by_re108_29-8-rgb_front so go ahead and open your microwave
2t0by_re108_3-8-rgb_front we have of course all of our buttons on the outside
2t0by_re108_30-8-rgb_front check inside look around see what you can find
2t0by_re108_31-8-rgb_front go ahead and play around with it
2t0by_re108_32-8-rgb_front like i said just to make sure that you do cook things properly to avoid things drying
2t0by_re108_33-8-rgb_front that is the basic uses of your microwave
2t0by_re108_4-8-rgb_front we have our numeric buttons of course if we want to type in how long we want something to be in there
2t0by_re108_5-8-rgb_front most microwaves will have a second thing so if you just want something to be in there for seconds or to add seconds to whatever you have
2t0by_re108_6-8-rgb_front a good thing about this one is you actually have a power setting
2t0by_re108_7-8-rgb_front whenever you see something that is microwavable it will say to microwave it on a medium high or low of course this is the button that you want to press to adjust that
2t0by_re108_8-8-rgb_front do listen to those because if you microwave something on high that needs to be low it will dry it out completely
2t0by_re108_9-8-rgb_front you got to remember a microwave actually speeds up the water molecules inside of your food to cause heat so if you evaporate all those water molecules you will have no more moisture inside of your food
2t9guhwlcqq_0-5-rgb_front get down on one knee is going to illustrate to your dog the process of learning the leave it command
2t9guhwlcqq_1-5-rgb_front not every dog can simple see the item and not eat it
2t9guhwlcqq_2-5-rgb_front so what i want you to practice with your dog is bait them with a treat get down on one knee and lightly hold their collar
2t9guhwlcqq_3-5-rgb_front this is going to show them just a light resistance and they are going to learn to be still before you put the object down that they should not be eating
2t9guhwlcqq_4-5-rgb_front it is good to always have a collar on your dog because it always illustrates dominance with you the human and it teaches your dog to be more submissive
2t9guhwlcqq_5-5-rgb_front as your dog learns the leave it command better you will no longer have to be down on one knee
2t9guhwlcqq_6-5-rgb_front but it is important in the beginning to get down on the knee lightly hold your dog so they learn not to eat the object on the floor
2t9guhwlcqq_7-5-rgb_front good dog
2tf0eh_6nfe_0-3-rgb_front another offensive move that can come in handy when you need a fast one is the flick
2tf0eh_6nfe_1-3-rgb_front the flick can be hard to master and i recommend that you practice on someone other than a person because flicking hurts
2tf0eh_6nfe_10-3-rgb_front and even in play when you are doing it correctly flicks are not comfortable so be aware that someone if you begin flicking excessively those are probably what those dirty looks are about that you have been getting
2tf0eh_6nfe_2-3-rgb_front proper flicking technique does not land on the flat of the blade it actually engages the tip because of course that is the only way you are going to land that touch
2tf0eh_6nfe_3-3-rgb_front a flick is exactly what it sounds like though where you actually you engage the wrist to do a fast flicking motion with your foil
2tf0eh_6nfe_4-3-rgb_front the foil is the lightest and most flexible weapon so it actually bends quite easily and you can see there is a little bit of curve in the blade as i flick
2tf0eh_6nfe_5-3-rgb_front which is as it turns out perfect for reaching over an opponent s back and landing a hit a touch on that hard to reach hard to parry target area
2tf0eh_6nfe_6-3-rgb_front so from the side a flick looks something like this
2tf0eh_6nfe_7-3-rgb_front so again a fast attack it darts out it does engage that straight arm but you can flick an opponent in the back from in front of them very quickly with the proper technique
2tf0eh_6nfe_8-3-rgb_front so practice on a wall like the padded walls we have here practice on a dummy
2tf0eh_6nfe_9-3-rgb_front practice on something besides a person until you master that technique
2um9vdo_ulq_0-8-rgb_front this koshinage hip throw is going to be from an overhead strike shomen uchi
2um9vdo_ulq_1-8-rgb_front right here
2um9vdo_ulq_10-8-rgb_front he is not on my upper back he is not twisted
2um9vdo_ulq_11-8-rgb_front he is centered on my back
2um9vdo_ulq_12-8-rgb_front so daniel comes in i am here to the side catch that leg and load him up on your hips
2um9vdo_ulq_13-8-rgb_front let is do that one more time
2um9vdo_ulq_14-8-rgb_front i am here protect myself load him on the hips load him up just like this
2um9vdo_ulq_15-8-rgb_front let is go ahead and do the throw now
2um9vdo_ulq_16-8-rgb_front here
2um9vdo_ulq_17-8-rgb_front and we will do that one more time
2um9vdo_ulq_18-8-rgb_front and that is koshinage or hip throw from an overhead shomen uchi strike
2um9vdo_ulq_2-8-rgb_front this is a very dynamic throw
2um9vdo_ulq_3-8-rgb_front as daniel is coming in i need to close the gap to him
2um9vdo_ulq_4-8-rgb_front and i use his cut as he is cutting down as part of the technique
2um9vdo_ulq_5-8-rgb_front it is very difficult just to heave him off the ground so i want him to do most of the work
2um9vdo_ulq_6-8-rgb_front because you are going to come in and enter the gap close to him and cut him down over my back
2um9vdo_ulq_7-8-rgb_front i am here i have loaded him in my hips here
2um9vdo_ulq_8-8-rgb_front literally load him up onto my body and i would use my hip flip motion to turn him over
2um9vdo_ulq_9-8-rgb_front as you notice it is pretty easy for me to turn around with daniel because he is on my hips
2ufka0bzgsy_0-8-rgb_front hi
2ufka0bzgsy_1-8-rgb_front i am travis corpering and here we are at carolina beach recreation center and i am about to teach you how to tomahawk dunk a basketball
2ufka0bzgsy_10-8-rgb_front the harder you bring it down the less likely they are going to be willing to try it again
2ufka0bzgsy_11-8-rgb_front so try that tomahawk dunk
2ufka0bzgsy_12-8-rgb_front finish it with authority the first time so the next time you come into paint they will have second thoughts
2ufka0bzgsy_13-8-rgb_front there you have it the tomahawk dunk
2ufka0bzgsy_2-8-rgb_front now first of all you want to actually be able to dunk before you get into trying to do anything complex or fancy
2ufka0bzgsy_3-8-rgb_front but if you are already at that level and you are ready to move on up to the next level here is how you get started
2ufka0bzgsy_4-8-rgb_front what you want to do is you want to take off just like a regular dunk feet out and once you take off you want to raise up and actually bring the ball behind your head
2ufka0bzgsy_5-8-rgb_front bringing the ball behind your head actually can be effective during the game
2ufka0bzgsy_6-8-rgb_front a tomahawk can actually be effective during the game if you are trying to dunk and finish strong on somebody underneath the basket because bringing the ball back makes them have to actually reach for the ball
2ufka0bzgsy_7-8-rgb_front you are more prone to get a foul call and complete the dunk
2ufka0bzgsy_8-8-rgb_front so you want to bring it up behind your back
2ufka0bzgsy_9-8-rgb_front touch your numbers if you can and bring it down over the rim with authority so that no one can block your shot
2uw1mv-n3ec_0-3-rgb_front hey my name is addison from captain bill is and i am going to show you how to do a pancake in volleyball
2uw1mv-n3ec_1-3-rgb_front pancake in volleyball is when you take your hand and put it onto the ground like a pancake and the ball lands on top
2uw1mv-n3ec_2-3-rgb_front so when you are try to do a pancake what you want to do is you want to lay all the way out extend your body to its fullest ability and try to aim for your hand to be under the ball so the ball pops straight up
2uw1mv-n3ec_3-3-rgb_front in indoor volleyball it is very effective because you have a hard ground and a lot of times you need to sprawl out for a ball so when you are sprawling out for a ball you want to dive and like i said stretch out your body and stretch out your arm and make sure your hand is under flat on the ground and underneath the ball so the ball pops straight up
2uw1mv-n3ec_4-3-rgb_front and beach volleyball is used every once and a while but not a whole lot because the sand is very unstable and you can not get a good you can not get your hand on the ground and have a flat surface to get up the volleyball
2uw1mv-n3ec_5-3-rgb_front and that is how to pancake a volleyball
2vdx6po-ucq_0-8-rgb_front hi i am james dix from reptile rescue service in salt lake city utah
2vdx6po-ucq_1-8-rgb_front and we are discussing how to take care of your painted turtle or either an aquatic turtle or painted turtle
2vdx6po-ucq_2-8-rgb_front pretty much the same thing just a different species
2vdx6po-ucq_3-8-rgb_front this particular one here is an asian leaf turtle but you would give them a habitat that would be in your house a twenty gallon tank filtration system
2vdx6po-ucq_4-8-rgb_front make sure that you have a log or a rock that they can climb up out of the water cause they do like to basque under a heat lamp
2vdx6po-ucq_5-8-rgb_front you need to put in a zoom in heat lamp depending on what size tank would be the wattage they can tell you how deep your tank is what you would need at the pet store
2vdx6po-ucq_6-8-rgb_front most of the time it is seventy five watt and up
2vdx6po-ucq_7-8-rgb_front it is very critical that you keep their water clean that you have a good filtration pump because if you do not the pump will plug up and they can get fungus and other diseases
2vdx6po-ucq_8-8-rgb_front it is also very important to let your children know or whoever is handling the turtle that always wash your hands afterwards cause aquatic turtles carry a lot of pin worms and salmonella
2vdx6po-ucq_9-8-rgb_front so make sure that you do follow these procedures and these little tips on keeping your hands clean and you will have a healthy turtle and also nobody will catch anything from your turtle
2zpzfyzkzf0_0-5-rgb_front ok to start off your nail art if the person that you are doing nail art on or if you are doing it on yourself you are going to need to remove any nail polish that is on the natural nail or on the acrylic nail
2zpzfyzkzf0_1-5-rgb_front to do that you start by getting a lint free cotton ball
2zpzfyzkzf0_10-5-rgb_front it just makes it easier if you have a little system to go through
2zpzfyzkzf0_11-5-rgb_front and as you take it off make sure that there is not any polish left over on the fingernail itself
2zpzfyzkzf0_12-5-rgb_front you may also have to actually go underneath the nail to get any excess polish off
2zpzfyzkzf0_13-5-rgb_front and then once you have removed the polish from all ten nails you will be ready to start your nail art design
2zpzfyzkzf0_14-5-rgb_front and this is how you just take off the polish
2zpzfyzkzf0_15-5-rgb_front off of all ten nails
2zpzfyzkzf0_2-5-rgb_front you prefer lint free just because you do not want any little hairs or any little pieces of anything getting into the polish to mess up your design
2zpzfyzkzf0_3-5-rgb_front you are going to take your polish remover also known as acetone
2zpzfyzkzf0_4-5-rgb_front saturate your cotton ball with it and then you are going to start removing the polish from all ten nails
2zpzfyzkzf0_5-5-rgb_front when you use a lint free cotton ball it tends to make clean up a little less messy
2zpzfyzkzf0_6-5-rgb_front you can get into all the crevices a little easier
2zpzfyzkzf0_7-5-rgb_front and you are just going to start taking the polish off one nail at a time
2zpzfyzkzf0_8-5-rgb_front if you happen to see any fuzz left over just pull it off
2zpzfyzkzf0_9-5-rgb_front i like to start by starting with the pinkie nail and working into the thumb
3-fare8grc0_0-8-rgb_front okay the next exercise we are going to do with the medicine ball and we are going to work again in tandem two people it is called the kick toss
3-fare8grc0_1-8-rgb_front it is not as easy as it looks
3-fare8grc0_10_11_12-8-rgb_front he is going to toss it up into the air and i am going to catch it okay he is going to load it and he is going to toss it straight up okay
3-fare8grc0_13-8-rgb_front as high as we can get it
3-fare8grc0_14-8-rgb_front there we go
3-fare8grc0_15-8-rgb_front so i toss it back to him
3-fare8grc0_16-8-rgb_front he loads it
3-fare8grc0_17-8-rgb_front he tosses it back up to me
3-fare8grc0_18-8-rgb_front i toss it to him he loads it
3-fare8grc0_19-8-rgb_front toss it back
3-fare8grc0_2-8-rgb_front what we are going to do is we are going to have guy get down on his back
3-fare8grc0_20-8-rgb_front kick toss
3-fare8grc0_21-8-rgb_front there we go
3-fare8grc0_22-8-rgb_front okay guy
3-fare8grc0_23-8-rgb_front what do you feel that that is working for you
3-fare8grc0_24-8-rgb_front it is working my ab it is getting my inner thigh calves
3-fare8grc0_25-8-rgb_front it is pretty good
3-fare8grc0_26-8-rgb_front full lower body work out
3-fare8grc0_27-8-rgb_front the kick toss
3-fare8grc0_3-8-rgb_front what i am going to do is i am going to actually toss it to guy
3-fare8grc0_4-8-rgb_front guy is going to load it up on to his ankle area of his feet and toss it back up to me
3-fare8grc0_5-8-rgb_front whereas i am going to catch it and then return it back to him again
3-fare8grc0_6-8-rgb_front so this is building his calves his eye hand coordination while he is catching it he is loading it he is tossing it back up to me
3-fare8grc0_7-8-rgb_front so we are getting quite a bit of different work outs here
3-fare8grc0_8-8-rgb_front so i am tossing it to guy
3-fare8grc0_9-8-rgb_front he is going to load it
3-zqahvxtsi_1-8-rgb_front in this segment we are going to discuss the tools that you use working with glass
3-zqahvxtsi_10-8-rgb_front if you do it good enough you can do a mobber
3-zqahvxtsi_11-8-rgb_front here is just a big graphite paddle this is used for all sorts of dimensions and to shape things with your glass
3-zqahvxtsi_12-8-rgb_front the last one we are going to discuss here are the bead masher which would give you parallel edges whenever you are working which can finish out any kind of project
3-zqahvxtsi_13-8-rgb_front any or all combination with these tools you can also make sweet glass art
3-zqahvxtsi_2-8-rgb_front so first off obviously is to start your torch you are going to need the igniter
3-zqahvxtsi_3-8-rgb_front now this is just your average igniter for your grill or whatever starts a little bit the flame
3-zqahvxtsi_4-8-rgb_front from beyond that we carry on to some tweezers which comes in many different sizes some big guys some smaller ones here we got ones with different edges and tips
3-zqahvxtsi_5-8-rgb_front here we have a pick to is for picking and dragging color through your glass art
3-zqahvxtsi_6-8-rgb_front here we have a graphite rimer
3-zqahvxtsi_7-8-rgb_front a graphite is very important with glass because the glass does not stick to the graphite when the glass is blown
3-zqahvxtsi_8-8-rgb_front beyond that we are going to use glass shears which we can cut glass in high temperature
3-zqahvxtsi_9-8-rgb_front here we have a marble mobber which is a hand held mobber hand you can round off ends off whatever you are working on
305bkbyrzfk_0-8-rgb_front nathan mccullough hi
305bkbyrzfk_10-8-rgb_front i will take my thermostat housing itself and slip it down into position over my thermostat
305bkbyrzfk_11-8-rgb_front and once i have it in place i am going to go ahead and start my bolts
305bkbyrzfk_12-8-rgb_front it is a good idea to start all of your bolts before tightening any of them down
305bkbyrzfk_13-8-rgb_front that way you can ensure that all of the bolts will be lined up correctly
305bkbyrzfk_14-8-rgb_front if you were to tightened one bolt down just throw the bolt in and tighten one down then you may not be able to start any of the other ones
305bkbyrzfk_15-8-rgb_front for some of the bolts you may find it necessary to take and just remove the ratchet from your socket end extension assembly and slip the bolt into it
305bkbyrzfk_16-8-rgb_front and from there you can go ahead and get a little bit better reach down into some very remote locations
305bkbyrzfk_17-8-rgb_front okay once you have all three of them or two of them depending upon your particular case start it and hand tight
305bkbyrzfk_18-8-rgb_front it is okay to go ahead and torque them
305bkbyrzfk_19-8-rgb_front you are going to want to use the start pattern when you are torquing down any kind of gaskets including a thermostat gasket
305bkbyrzfk_2-8-rgb_front in these clips we are going to talk about the proper way to remove and replace your vehicle is thermostat
305bkbyrzfk_20-8-rgb_front and the concept is pretty much to go from one bolt you just have to pick one and start with it to going to the next farthest one away
305bkbyrzfk_21-8-rgb_front so from there we are going to hop right up to here and we are going to run this one down
305bkbyrzfk_22-8-rgb_front all right
305bkbyrzfk_23-8-rgb_front and that is the proper way to install your vehicle is thermostat and the thermostat housing
305bkbyrzfk_3-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about the proper way to reinstall your vehicle is thermostat and the engine thermostat housing
305bkbyrzfk_4-8-rgb_front i have my thermostat right here in hand i am going to sit it on top of my intake plenum and i have my thermostat housing
305bkbyrzfk_5-8-rgb_front what i am going to do is take and seat my thermostat into the lower intake manifold where it goes and sits right in there
305bkbyrzfk_6-8-rgb_front the location is going to vary widely depending upon the make and model
305bkbyrzfk_7-8-rgb_front generally however they are in the intake manifold
305bkbyrzfk_8-8-rgb_front you will see it is seated right there
305bkbyrzfk_9-8-rgb_front you want to make sure it is seated good and flushed and that there is no debris on the intake side that will affect your sealing surface
30y7o8anntq_1-5-rgb_front so a week before when you start your training physical training for the marathon you really need to know what your city requires in order for you to be able to compete in the marathon
30y7o8anntq_2-5-rgb_front so usually this happens way in advance for example here in new york city you have to actually run races the previous year with road runners in order to qualify for next years marathon
30y7o8anntq_3-5-rgb_front so you need to get all the details you do not want to do the training and then be disappointed it if you do not meet the deadlines and applications to get in
30y7o8anntq_4-5-rgb_front so it all depending where you are and what does requirements are
311bwitlg-i_0-8-rgb_front today we are going to learn how to make coiling
311bwitlg-i_1-8-rgb_front the coiling style is really interesting because you can make many different things out of it
311bwitlg-i_10-8-rgb_front with the industrial wire you are going to want to keep in mind that unless you clean it with steel wool there may be some residue that comes off of that
311bwitlg-i_11-8-rgb_front that may be on your hands
311bwitlg-i_12-8-rgb_front wrapping that with your hands is very simple or you can use your pliers to wrap it
311bwitlg-i_13-8-rgb_front holding it into to place and wrapping it around
311bwitlg-i_14-8-rgb_front you will end up with something like this
311bwitlg-i_15-8-rgb_front this can be used as an accent to bracelets jewelry and any type of earrings
311bwitlg-i_16-8-rgb_front you can hang things off of it or you can just keep that really cool style that makes it a great accent to any piece of jewelry
311bwitlg-i_17-8-rgb_front that is how you coil around a larger wire
311bwitlg-i_2-8-rgb_front to start you are going to want to use different kinds of wires
311bwitlg-i_3-8-rgb_front down here we are going to start with a piece of industrial wire
311bwitlg-i_4-8-rgb_front this is kind of a larger thicker piece of wire that you are actually going to want to use professional wire cutters to cut
311bwitlg-i_5-8-rgb_front otherwise if you use your pliers or your smaller wire cutters you are going to probably damage them
311bwitlg-i_6-8-rgb_front using the industrial wire you are going to cut off a piece of this and you are going to want very pliable wire
311bwitlg-i_7-8-rgb_front this easily bendable and this is going to coil very nicely around the wire
311bwitlg-i_8-8-rgb_front you can actually do this just with your hands or you can do with the pliers
311bwitlg-i_9-8-rgb_front i am going to start with my hands just wrapping the bendable wire around the very firm industrial wire
34n8w-sdic4_0-5-rgb_front hi i am casey i am with elements university
34n8w-sdic4_2-5-rgb_front in this segment i am going to give you a few tips on clipper cutting
34n8w-sdic4_3-5-rgb_front before you start cutting the one thing you want to make sure as when you come up with the clippers upside the head you want to make sure that you rock it out at the top
34n8w-sdic4_4-5-rgb_front right at the line where you are ready to end
34n8w-sdic4_5-5-rgb_front if you come in and pull it straight out what will end up happening is you will get lines right in this section of the head
34n8w-sdic4_6-5-rgb_front you will actually see the lines of your clipper blade so again it is extremely important as you are coming up to rock out with the clipper blade
34n8w-sdic4_7-5-rgb_front stay tune for our next segment and i am going to give you one more tip on clipper cutting
362n8qec4bg_0-3-rgb_front okay in order to have successful gimbap you have to have good successful sticky rice
362n8qec4bg_1-3-rgb_front and i got about a cup of rice that i have already washed in this bowl
362n8qec4bg_2-3-rgb_front i am going to add about cups of water
362n8qec4bg_3-3-rgb_front now i am just using the bowl so i can get the rest of the rice out of it
362n8qec4bg_4-3-rgb_front cups of water and i like to add a little extra to make sure the rice is nice and sticky and it would hold the gimbap together
362n8qec4bg_5-3-rgb_front i am going to move it over put it onto a flame on high flame
362n8qec4bg_6-3-rgb_front oops on the other burner and then what you want to do is let this come to a boil
362n8qec4bg_7-3-rgb_front as soon as it comes to a boil put a lid on it and in minutes you have a perfect pot of rice
36xbmaznzrg_0-5-rgb_front in this segment we are going to cover a bet called daily double
36xbmaznzrg_1-5-rgb_front this is one of the more complicated bets that you can actually place at a racing establishment
36xbmaznzrg_10-5-rgb_front and we would actually have to stop it after the second line because there is no third and fourth place that we are going to worry about
36xbmaznzrg_11-5-rgb_front and in this wheel it is not first place and it is not second place it is first race second race so again if we go back to our example let is say we wanted to do one two three and four five six we would do ok i want to do a daily double at this i want to go to this track do a one dollar daily double
36xbmaznzrg_12-5-rgb_front i want to wheel the one two three that is dog horse or dog one two or three coming in first place on race two
36xbmaznzrg_13-5-rgb_front and then four five six would be the wheel for the second race to come in first
36xbmaznzrg_14-5-rgb_front so we want one two or three to come in first for race two or four fix and six to come in for race three
36xbmaznzrg_15-5-rgb_front it is not interchangeable if you box it you would have to box a one two three four five six and the reason it gets really expensive is it starts putting one two three four five six for race two
36xbmaznzrg_16-5-rgb_front and then one two three four five six for race three
36xbmaznzrg_17-5-rgb_front so you are basically paying one dollar for each of those bets in every single combination that there is and trust me there is a lot of them especially with that many numbers you are basically taking those six positions and writing out every single combination of those numbers in every single way
36xbmaznzrg_18-5-rgb_front and that is basically a daily double
36xbmaznzrg_2-5-rgb_front a daily double is basically an exacta with a really big twist
36xbmaznzrg_3-5-rgb_front you are betting on what is coming in first for the race in which that bet starts and then the next race after that on which number is going to come in first
36xbmaznzrg_4-5-rgb_front so to explain that in a little better way
36xbmaznzrg_5-5-rgb_front let is say that the daily double starts in race two and ends in race three
36xbmaznzrg_6-5-rgb_front so for race two we are picking what number we think is going to come in first and that is the very first number we put in a daily double
36xbmaznzrg_7-5-rgb_front the second number is what is going to come in for the second race in the first position
36xbmaznzrg_8-5-rgb_front we can wheel this and we can also box it but boxing gets really complicated on this bet and it is also really expensive
36xbmaznzrg_9-5-rgb_front if we were to wheel this the first half of our wheel if you remember back to our wheel was a one

39koitcem_g_0-3-rgb_front proper fit for a baggier jersey is really a lot of it is just personal preference
39koitcem_g_1-3-rgb_front obviously you do not want things to be so long that they get caught on things on the side of the trail and stuff like that
39koitcem_g_2-3-rgb_front but at the same time you do not want things to be tight enough that you can not accomplish the things that you are trying to accomplish by wearing a looser jersey
39koitcem_g_3-3-rgb_front like you can see when i put this one on it is loose enough that if i wanted to wear some padding on my chest or on my arms i would have that option
39koitcem_g_4-3-rgb_front it is not super constricting and it would be pretty comfortable for going out and riding
39koitcem_g_5-3-rgb_front for a warmer jersey this is a really nice wool jersey
39koitcem_g_6-3-rgb_front i love wool as a fabric for a cyclist because it does not smell after a while like acrylic fabrics cans and it is also really good at removing moister
39koitcem_g_7-3-rgb_front my wool jersey has a similar fit to i had with my more traditional road fit jersey
39koitcem_g_8-3-rgb_front a little bit looser in the elbows and a much looser hem which makes it work a lot better with a baggy short
3az3qdtv1bm_0-5-rgb_front alright the drink we are about to make is called cowboy killer
3az3qdtv1bm_1-5-rgb_front first thing we will do is put our ice in a glass and add one shot of tequila
3az3qdtv1bm_10-5-rgb_front set up a glass and give it a pour
3az3qdtv1bm_11-5-rgb_front and we get a nice frothy beverage
3az3qdtv1bm_12-5-rgb_front there we go
3az3qdtv1bm_13-5-rgb_front and do not be afraid to kick the cowboy boots and the shit kickers and enjoy a cowboy killer
3az3qdtv1bm_14-5-rgb_front bottoms up
3az3qdtv1bm_2-5-rgb_front there we go
3az3qdtv1bm_3-5-rgb_front follow that up with a half a shot of bailey is
3az3qdtv1bm_4-5-rgb_front and also a half a shot of butterscotch schnapps
3az3qdtv1bm_5-5-rgb_front and finally we will just fill it up the rest of the way with half and half
3az3qdtv1bm_6-5-rgb_front there we go
3az3qdtv1bm_7-5-rgb_front and we will go ahead and mix this up real well
3az3qdtv1bm_8-5-rgb_front and if you would had a long day of raising and roping broncos just make yourself a cowboy killer

3aq_kjzr-2w_0-5-rgb_front cindy mastry a really great way to stretch your shoulders and even help if you have a rotator cuff injury is gomukasana working on the upper body
3aq_kjzr-2w_1-5-rgb_front so i am going to ask faith to just turn back on the diagonal and come in to her gomukasan legs cow face
3aq_kjzr-2w_10-5-rgb_front she is going to bring that hand down and just pat herself right in between her shoulder blades
3aq_kjzr-2w_11-5-rgb_front good
3aq_kjzr-2w_12-5-rgb_front it might even take time to take a little triceps stretch right here
3aq_kjzr-2w_13-5-rgb_front good
3aq_kjzr-2w_14-5-rgb_front then she is going to take her left arm extended out to the side and rotate forward internally rotate with her shoulder and then bend her elbow and bring her other arm around and approach grabbing onto her hands
3aq_kjzr-2w_15-5-rgb_front this is where the strap really comes in handy
3aq_kjzr-2w_16-5-rgb_front so if you do not have a strap you could also just grab on to your shirt or a scarf or maybe you have a belt
3aq_kjzr-2w_17-5-rgb_front good
3aq_kjzr-2w_18-5-rgb_front so this strap is going to allow her to gently walk her fingers closer as her body as she holds and breathes into the stretch
3aq_kjzr-2w_19-5-rgb_front she is just going to be able to release just a little bit more and with each inhale lengthening with each exhale opening up her shoulders opening up through her heart and bringing her hands just a little bit closer together
3aq_kjzr-2w_2-5-rgb_front good
3aq_kjzr-2w_20-5-rgb_front till eventually she can hold each other is hands
3aq_kjzr-2w_3-5-rgb_front stacking her knees on top of each other
3aq_kjzr-2w_4-5-rgb_front good
3aq_kjzr-2w_5-5-rgb_front sitting square on both her sit bones
3aq_kjzr-2w_6-5-rgb_front good
3aq_kjzr-2w_7-5-rgb_front she is going to take her right arm out to the side and reach it up over her head and internally rotate
3aq_kjzr-2w_8-5-rgb_front good
3aq_kjzr-2w_9-5-rgb_front so her palm faces as far back as possible
3bmkbpgned0_0-3-rgb_front so once your lid has had a chance to set up and dry just a little bit set it into your bottle and make sure that it fits nicely
3bmkbpgned0_1-3-rgb_front that is about just exactly what i wanted
3bmkbpgned0_10-3-rgb_front and once you have got it on there you can make it into whatever shape you want it to be
3bmkbpgned0_11-3-rgb_front you can carve you can let it sit to leather hard and then carve a form into it if you want or you can just make a little pointy knob which is what i am going to do
3bmkbpgned0_12-3-rgb_front and i am pushing in here so that i have somewhere to grab
3bmkbpgned0_13-3-rgb_front so there we go
3bmkbpgned0_14-3-rgb_front it has a nice little organic looking knob
3bmkbpgned0_2-3-rgb_front and then take i am not going to throw a knob i am just going to make a little knob
3bmkbpgned0_3-3-rgb_front so i am just going to take a little bit of clay and roll it up
3bmkbpgned0_4-3-rgb_front and then just kind of pinch it with my fingers into a cone
3bmkbpgned0_5-3-rgb_front and that is a little bigger than i want so i am just going to cut a little bit of the base off there
3bmkbpgned0_6-3-rgb_front now i will take my scoring tool again and score the top of the knob
3bmkbpgned0_7-3-rgb_front score the top of the stopper that is
3bmkbpgned0_8-3-rgb_front score the bottom of the knob and then just push it right on there
3bmkbpgned0_9-3-rgb_front and i am going to smooth it in all the way around just gently with my finger
3buvrajdzyk_1-3-rgb_front now that our butter and sugar have been fully mixed
3buvrajdzyk_10-3-rgb_front and then we are going to do what we did with the first one we are going to mix it in fully before going to the next step
3buvrajdzyk_2-3-rgb_front it is time to add the eggs we are going to add two eggs but one at a time
3buvrajdzyk_3-3-rgb_front we are going to mix each one fully before we add the second
3buvrajdzyk_4-3-rgb_front be careful when adding each egg make sure you do not get any shell in there
3buvrajdzyk_5-3-rgb_front start mixer off slowly before speeding it up a bit the important thing when mixing it is that the egg yolk breaks before you speed it up this will help ensure you are not splattering the egg
3buvrajdzyk_6-3-rgb_front let is speed it up
3buvrajdzyk_7-3-rgb_front and when we need to scrape down the side a bit before adding the next egg
3buvrajdzyk_8-3-rgb_front right now there is lots of sugar in there compared to the amount of egg so it is not really changing the consistency very much but making it a bit wet
3buvrajdzyk_9-3-rgb_front now we are going to add our second egg
3c3mfkmny-y_1-5-rgb_front so what we want to do is put a little oil into the pan you can use corn oil or canola oil or peanut oil whatever you like just to coat the bottom of the pan cause we are going to be cooking our beef and our pork and we even added some ground beef to it
3c3mfkmny-y_1-8-rgb_front so what we want to do is put a little oil into the pan you can use corn oil or canola oil or peanut oil whatever you like just to coat the bottom of the pan cause we are going to be cooking our beef and our pork and we even added some ground beef to it
3c3mfkmny-y_2-5-rgb_front you can use lean but i do not use the one fat because it is going to add a lot of flavor to chili it is not a low cal dish anyway so go ahead and put it on your heated high
3c3mfkmny-y_2-8-rgb_front you can use lean but i do not use the one fat because it is going to add a lot of flavor to chili it is not a low cal dish anyway so go ahead and put it on your heated high
3c3mfkmny-y_3-5-rgb_front get the sizzling really well and we will start to put in our beef right in little cubes of beef you will see it going to be really meaty and chewy it is going to be awesome
3c3mfkmny-y_3-8-rgb_front get the sizzling really well and we will start to put in our beef right in little cubes of beef you will see it going to be really meaty and chewy it is going to be awesome
3c3mfkmny-y_4-5-rgb_front and then we will put in our ground beef as well this will start sizzling very shortly here is our ground beef just kind of break it off and move it around there
3c3mfkmny-y_4-8-rgb_front and then we will put in our ground beef as well this will start sizzling very shortly here is our ground beef just kind of break it off and move it around there
3c3mfkmny-y_5-5-rgb_front then we are going to season this up this is about a pound of ground beef too so depending on how many your going to be making this for this is probably going to feed around people easily you can start to hear that sizzle come up
3c3mfkmny-y_5-8-rgb_front then we are going to season this up this is about a pound of ground beef too so depending on how many your going to be making this for this is probably going to feed around people easily you can start to hear that sizzle come up
3croubbvrkq_0-5-rgb_front somebody did somebody wrong song
3croubbvrkq_1-5-rgb_front how to say you are sorry
3croubbvrkq_10-5-rgb_front oh right did you have a couple of drinks and sit there and cry and slobber and say i am sorry
3croubbvrkq_11-5-rgb_front well that is not going to get it is it
3croubbvrkq_12-5-rgb_front when you say you are sorry you must do it quietly do not scream it i have heard that before

3croubbvrkq_15-5-rgb_front i feel horribly sorry
3croubbvrkq_16-5-rgb_front use something more than just sorry i am sorry no means nothing
3croubbvrkq_17-5-rgb_front if you are going to do it mean it do not do it very often
3croubbvrkq_18-5-rgb_front it loses its impact
3croubbvrkq_19-5-rgb_front if you have to do it very often it means you are obviously doing something wrong and that goes for man or woman
3croubbvrkq_2-5-rgb_front this is doctor paul author of boomer girls a boomer woman is guide to men and dating and host of ask doctor paul
3croubbvrkq_20-5-rgb_front okay
3croubbvrkq_21-5-rgb_front i am sorry is not good enough

3fjsnfupila_12-8-rgb_front you pretend that this elbow is glued to your hip
3fjsnfupila_13-8-rgb_front from the back foot you feel the energy come up and you pivot the back foot and push it out and back
3fjsnfupila_14-8-rgb_front that is where the power comes is you put your whole body behind it

3in4ll2emjg_0-5-rgb_front in the western print making tradition the brayer is an essential element to the printmaking process
3in4ll2emjg_1-5-rgb_front the brayers come in several different sizes as you can see i have several different brayers here and the size of the brayer is going to be dependent upon the size of the block
3in4ll2emjg_10-5-rgb_front if i was to keep rolling over the block without putting more ink onto my brayer i would simply be taking the ink back off of the block of wood
3in4ll2emjg_11-5-rgb_front now the first time that you print the block is going to be very thirsty
3in4ll2emjg_12-5-rgb_front the more successive prints that you make the less amount of ink that you will need to use
3in4ll2emjg_13-5-rgb_front but when you first print you are going to need to put on quite a bit of ink onto that block in order to get a nicely printed image
3in4ll2emjg_14-5-rgb_front luckily since i my block so that i could see my carve marks i am not working on a surface that does not have any ink on it whatsoever
3in4ll2emjg_15-5-rgb_front so it will not it will not take as many layers of ink on it as it would if it were just a thin block of wood
3in4ll2emjg_16-5-rgb_front but still it is going to need quite a bit
3in4ll2emjg_2-5-rgb_front but also where the imaginary is concentrated and how much space is carved away
3in4ll2emjg_3-5-rgb_front i have chosen this size brayer for this proof that we are about to pull
3in4ll2emjg_4-5-rgb_front and it is also very important for me to get a really nice sheet of ink that is not too gloppy but is not too thin
3in4ll2emjg_5-5-rgb_front and it does take a little bit of time to get used to knowing how much ink you need and how to get that nice layer of ink
3in4ll2emjg_6-5-rgb_front but it will become obvious once you start laying the ink onto your block of wood
3in4ll2emjg_7-5-rgb_front if there is too much ink on your brayer you are going to get spots
3in4ll2emjg_8-5-rgb_front if there is not enough ink on your brayer than you are not going to get very much ink onto the block of wood
3in4ll2emjg_9-5-rgb_front now every time i lay ink onto the wood i am going to my brayer of ink
3jizryxz-aa_0-8-rgb_front many people just love to pair wine and chocolate and i do too they are two of my best friends and a match made in heaven
3jizryxz-aa_1-8-rgb_front but wine and chocolate is a very complicated match up
3jizryxz-aa_10-8-rgb_front if we can find that wine it is just perfect
3jizryxz-aa_11-8-rgb_front there is a lot of different types of chocolate out there and each of them have their own method of pairing up with wine
3jizryxz-aa_12-8-rgb_front but let is say for chocolate the perfect match is a rich sweet red wine that can match on the taste and the flavor and the texture
3jizryxz-aa_13-8-rgb_front in my opinion the best wine in the world for chocolate would be a nice ruby port perhaps a late harvest zinfandel or even a sparkling shiraz from australia
3jizryxz-aa_14-8-rgb_front try any of those wines with chocolate and you will have a great match
3jizryxz-aa_2-8-rgb_front here is why
3jizryxz-aa_3-8-rgb_front chocolate has just about everything going for it
3jizryxz-aa_4-8-rgb_front it is very high in fat which is mouth coating and makes the wine taste a little thinner
3jizryxz-aa_5-8-rgb_front chocolate can also have a little bit of bitterness in it which is something we have to be careful with
3jizryxz-aa_6-8-rgb_front chocolate has lots and lots of sugar which can also make a wine pairing kind of tough
3jizryxz-aa_7-8-rgb_front and chocolate is the most intense flavor on the face of the earth in my opinion
3jizryxz-aa_8-8-rgb_front that can make it a little bit difficult for a wine to match up with chocolate
3jizryxz-aa_9-8-rgb_front so what we need to do is find a wine that can stand up to the sweetness stand up to the flavor not have any bitterness and not manage the onslaught of all that fat from chocolate
3jqwncrx0wo_0-5-rgb_front setting up a new room for your cat should be fairly straight forward
3jqwncrx0wo_1-5-rgb_front if you have cats already you will know some of the basic things that they need
3jqwncrx0wo_10-5-rgb_front and then once they are allowed to come out into the rest of the house you can bring this bed out to their favorite spot they will already have a place that is familiar to them that they feel safe and comfortable in
3jqwncrx0wo_2-5-rgb_front if this is your first cat then let me go over everything you will need to have a happy healthy cat in its own isolation room
3jqwncrx0wo_3-5-rgb_front the first thing you will need is a litter box you want to make sure it is nice and big and has a type of litter that the cat is already use to
3jqwncrx0wo_4-5-rgb_front this is a litter
3jqwncrx0wo_5-5-rgb_front if you can find out what your cat has had before its come to you it will be great to have the same litter that its had all along for it to have an easier transition
3jqwncrx0wo_6-5-rgb_front the next thing you want to have is you want to have a scratching area for your cat it can be a sisal scratching post or a scratching pad it does not have to be something this big just something that the cat can have so that it can fulfill its need to scratch things
3jqwncrx0wo_7-5-rgb_front next you want to have some toys in place
3jqwncrx0wo_8-5-rgb_front this is a great little bouncy toy it does not take up very much room and the cat can play with this in all different ways it can grab it and pull it down or bat it around and it will give your kitty something to do while it is in its new room
3jqwncrx0wo_9-5-rgb_front also you want to have some kind of a bed for your kitty a little hammock like this on this condo is great or you can have a free standing cat bed that has a little bit of a covering so they can really hunker down in there and feel like they are hiding this will give them a place where they are very safe
3kn3x7ygpqs_0-5-rgb_front okay here showing that shoulder shrug to the wrist lock again
3kn3x7ygpqs_1-5-rgb_front okay this is a bit theoretical it takes a lot of practice to do
3kn3x7ygpqs_10-5-rgb_front here and to do it fast i am going to rotate the other foot back for power
3kn3x7ygpqs_11-5-rgb_front you can break his wrist here but i will not cause of my partner but i could easily just break his wrist on the throw and then go to neon belly to finish
3kn3x7ygpqs_12-5-rgb_front and do some punches elbows whatever you want to do
3kn3x7ygpqs_13-5-rgb_front soccer kicks right there and then go in with the arm bar okay
3kn3x7ygpqs_14-5-rgb_front so full speed your shoulder shrug from the collar tie
3kn3x7ygpqs_15-5-rgb_front so here is full speed shoulder shrug to the wrist lock to your arm bar shrug it off
3kn3x7ygpqs_16-5-rgb_front a little fun technique you guys should practice safely of course under professional supervision
3kn3x7ygpqs_17-5-rgb_front hope you had fun with it
3kn3x7ygpqs_2-5-rgb_front but if you practice it be surprised i pulled this off on pretty decent grapplers from blue belts and what not when grappling live so if you are grappling live you could pull it off a lot of ways
3kn3x7ygpqs_3-5-rgb_front i mean there is other options i would do self defense but this you know when full punches are going i will probably just come in and go to something else
3kn3x7ygpqs_4-5-rgb_front but this is a technique that you should put in your repertoire
3kn3x7ygpqs_5-5-rgb_front so this is a shoulder shrug to the wrist lock take down and possibly an arm bar follow up if you get good at it
3kn3x7ygpqs_6-5-rgb_front so you are going to shoulder shrug that off and then come over the top for the wrist lock
3kn3x7ygpqs_7-5-rgb_front shoulder shrug it off boom and in this the elbow comes right to the hand
3kn3x7ygpqs_8-5-rgb_front boom right there thumb on top thumbs together pair all your fingertips together you are making here is the wrist lock
3kn3x7ygpqs_9-5-rgb_front you are making motion here and you want to take the hand and separate the shoulder
3lhpyq2ovrc_0-3-rgb_front this style of sunglasses is almost a little reminiscent of the blue blockers those sunglasses that block everything
3lhpyq2ovrc_1-3-rgb_front but with the coat lapels coming up and the hair being busy i wanted to have something that was simple a standard traditional silhouette for sunglasses i definitely want sunglasses that was part of the collection but i wanted to have something that was effortless and simple and that did not make a statement and did not detract from the jacket
3lhpyq2ovrc_2-3-rgb_front so i made sunglasses
3lhpyq2ovrc_3-3-rgb_front and they are very very simple to draw
3lhpyq2ovrc_4-3-rgb_front start at your midpoint there is no bridge here because they are one piece of material plastic
3lhpyq2ovrc_5-3-rgb_front so make your midpoint and then draw the top edge and then make sure you go back to the nose to the midpoint and draw your curved out one side and then draw your curved out other side
3lhpyq2ovrc_6-3-rgb_front and then fill in and there you have it
3ltxtl6px0q_0-5-rgb_front hi
3ltxtl6px0q_10-5-rgb_front it is really about what the asparagus itself looks like
3ltxtl6px0q_11-5-rgb_front you want to make sure you have a consistent color from the top almost to the bottom knowing that you are going to trim the bottom end here
3ltxtl6px0q_12-5-rgb_front when you look at pieces like this you can see there is much more of a difference in the color
3ltxtl6px0q_13-5-rgb_front you are going to get one or two within a bunch that are going to have that variation
3ltxtl6px0q_14-5-rgb_front but you want to avoid large bunches that all look like this
3ltxtl6px0q_15-5-rgb_front this is not going to be very tender not going to be very flavorful
3ltxtl6px0q_16-5-rgb_front the other thing that you want to look at and i have two bunches here
3ltxtl6px0q_17-5-rgb_front this is a more fresh set and you can look at the tips and they are pretty much all together they are a little fluffy they have got a little spring to them
3ltxtl6px0q_18-5-rgb_front and when you look over here you are going to see that these have sort of started to kind of decay
3ltxtl6px0q_19-5-rgb_front they are soft and mushy at the top
3ltxtl6px0q_2-5-rgb_front ever wonder how to pick good asparagus in a grocery store
3ltxtl6px0q_20-5-rgb_front some of them are worse than others
3ltxtl6px0q_21-5-rgb_front let is see
3ltxtl6px0q_22-5-rgb_front that kind of gives you a good idea
3ltxtl6px0q_23-5-rgb_front this is usually what you get when you take it out of your crisping drawer in your refrigerator after a week
3ltxtl6px0q_24-5-rgb_front this is not what you should be taking home from the grocery store
3ltxtl6px0q_25-5-rgb_front now one thing you need to consider when picking up asparagus at the store is how are the vegetables stored
3ltxtl6px0q_26-5-rgb_front and every grocery store is a little bit different
3ltxtl6px0q_27-5-rgb_front this particular bunch was actually piled up on top of crushed ice
3ltxtl6px0q_28-5-rgb_front and i know if you go to grocery stores early in the morning they are piling crushed ice on the vegetable and produce area and then they are just stacking their vegetables on top
3ltxtl6px0q_29-5-rgb_front this is one instance where pulling from the bottom may not be so smart
3ltxtl6px0q_3-5-rgb_front most people look at it and think the skinniest ones are going to be the most tender
3ltxtl6px0q_30-5-rgb_front if you look at this piece here this has been pushed against the ice
3ltxtl6px0q_31-5-rgb_front so what is happening is it is actually freezing the asparagus along the edge and it is causing it to decay
3ltxtl6px0q_32-5-rgb_front it is going to create ice crystals within the asparagus which is going to basically make that mushy
3ltxtl6px0q_33-5-rgb_front the more that happens the worst product you have in the end
3ltxtl6px0q_34-5-rgb_front so in this case just take a look
3ltxtl6px0q_35-5-rgb_front open it up make sure you are getting the freshest nicest asparagus you can have
3ltxtl6px0q_36-5-rgb_front it is going to last longer
3ltxtl6px0q_37-5-rgb_front it is going to taste better at home
3ltxtl6px0q_4-5-rgb_front to a degree that is true
3ltxtl6px0q_5-5-rgb_front but there are actually different varieties of asparagus that many people do not necessarily know about
3ltxtl6px0q_6-5-rgb_front there is pencil size there is this size here and then there is the larger thicker chunkier size which are typically depending on what you are doing a little more tough
3ltxtl6px0q_7-5-rgb_front but depending on how you cook it you can tenderize it
3ltxtl6px0q_8-5-rgb_front today we are really talking about picking fresh asparagus
3ltxtl6px0q_9-5-rgb_front it does not really matter what variety you are picking
3mxwlcktspu_0-5-rgb_front oh oh excuse me just having a little liquid refreshment
3mxwlcktspu_1-5-rgb_front this here is a mug
3mxwlcktspu_10-5-rgb_front now let is take a look at the common yucky japan mugs that you find these everywhere
3mxwlcktspu_11-5-rgb_front you do not want to buy these if you find them because they are pretty much worth nothing but everybody thinks they are great
3mxwlcktspu_12-5-rgb_front if you want to put them away for years do not count on this for retirement
3mxwlcktspu_14-5-rgb_front okay
3mxwlcktspu_15-5-rgb_front then let is talk about this is an interesting concept here
3mxwlcktspu_16-5-rgb_front this is one of my favorites because i like las vegas collectibles
3mxwlcktspu_17-5-rgb_front this is a japan and that is a whole other topic a whole other documentary las vegas collectibles
3mxwlcktspu_18-5-rgb_front this is an old casino that used to be downtown that no longer is
3mxwlcktspu_19-5-rgb_front but is not it cute
3mxwlcktspu_2-5-rgb_front and it says on here in german words or something
3mxwlcktspu_20-5-rgb_front and it is a made in japan mug
3mxwlcktspu_21-5-rgb_front so made in japan
3mxwlcktspu_22-5-rgb_front many uses
3mxwlcktspu_23-5-rgb_front some are more collectible than others given the topic or who it is or what it does
3mxwlcktspu_24-5-rgb_front so remember japan bottoms up
3mxwlcktspu_3-5-rgb_front and on the bottom it says avon
3mxwlcktspu_4-5-rgb_front i do not know if you saw one of mine but we talked about avon once
3mxwlcktspu_5-5-rgb_front and this is has got a tag that is in that remember i mentioned it was the foil tag
3mxwlcktspu_6-5-rgb_front this is a made in japan avon mug
3mxwlcktspu_7-5-rgb_front so it is still cute
3mxwlcktspu_8-5-rgb_front i am not big on mugs but this is a newer made in japan avon mug
3mxwlcktspu_9-5-rgb_front i would say i do not know probably the is is

3nfvqaqdgxe_3-5-rgb_front purpose is very important
3nfvqaqdgxe_3-8-rgb_front purpose is very important
3nfvqaqdgxe_4-5-rgb_front the purpose of the essay would be the aim of the essay or the plan of the essay
3nfvqaqdgxe_4-8-rgb_front the purpose of the essay would be the aim of the essay or the plan of the essay
3nfvqaqdgxe_5-5-rgb_front for instance if you are doing this for a professor or a high school teacher and they are telling you to write an imforative essay and you write a perssuasive
3nfvqaqdgxe_5-8-rgb_front for instance if you are doing this for a professor or a high school teacher and they are telling you to write an imforative essay and you write a perssuasive
3nfvqaqdgxe_6-5-rgb_front as far as me being an english teacher for years i would have given an f to that student

3nfvqaqdgxe_8-8-rgb_front if you do not meet your purpose nothing else matters
3nfvqaqdgxe_9-5-rgb_front let me give you an example of what i am talking about
3nfvqaqdgxe_9-8-rgb_front let me give you an example of what i am talking about
3nxjaqtjt4a_0-5-rgb_front the other types of intervals that you will find on the violin are half steps so i am going to play a half step on each of the four strings
3nxjaqtjt4a_1-5-rgb_front on the g string an a to a b flat would be a half step
3nxjaqtjt4a_2-5-rgb_front on a d string a e to a f would be a half step
3nxjaqtjt4a_3-5-rgb_front on the a string a b to a c is a half step
3nxjaqtjt4a_4-5-rgb_front and on the e string an f sharp to a g is a half step
3nxjaqtjt4a_5-5-rgb_front and there is other half steps but this is again to just familiarize yourself so you know what half steps are
3nxjaqtjt4a_6-5-rgb_front typically the the best way to to remember a whole step and a half step is that when you are playing a whole step your fingers are not touching
3nxjaqtjt4a_7-5-rgb_front but when you are playing a half step you fingers should be right next to each other
3nxjaqtjt4a_8-5-rgb_front and that is a half step
3pnhgu8nvwa_1-5-rgb_front my name is alexson
3pnhgu8nvwa_10-5-rgb_front so what we are going to do first is we are going to work on the upper body and we are going to work on pretty much the shoulders and the joints attributed to the shoulders and the arms
3pnhgu8nvwa_2-5-rgb_front i will be your therapist for today
3pnhgu8nvwa_3-5-rgb_front this is my series on massage therapy
3pnhgu8nvwa_4-5-rgb_front i am a massage therapist
3pnhgu8nvwa_5-5-rgb_front i have been studying body work and massage therapy for eight years now
3pnhgu8nvwa_6-5-rgb_front i went to englewood school of massage in newark new jersey and now i practice at paypony nail and day spa
3pnhgu8nvwa_7-5-rgb_front so we are going to begin today on sports massage
3pnhgu8nvwa_8-5-rgb_front and sports massage is generally related to athletes or weekend warriors or people who kinda like workout and then they might have problems affiliated with their workout or maybe joint issues
3pnhgu8nvwa_9-5-rgb_front because in this particular massage there is a lot of movement there is a lot stretching and there is a lot of passive range of motion that we are going to kinda contribute to the therapeutic part of this massage
3pl9efpwxwi_0-3-rgb_front when you display your iron stone you can display it on cabinets like this or open cabinets is a really subjective thing depends on how much room you have in your house and how you want to use it
3pl9efpwxwi_1-3-rgb_front if you want to use it for just display your going to put it on the shelf and not take it out or if your going to put it in your cupboard and use it everyday
3pl9efpwxwi_2-3-rgb_front on some of this iron stone is durable enough to put in your dishwasher i highly recommend that people do not use them that is just my from my experience i find that there is less chipping and the breaking down on the porcelain from the heat is not exactly the most ideal thing to do
3pl9efpwxwi_3-3-rgb_front so washing them by hand is what i recommend but for displaying them you can it is pretty much a subjective thing you can display all your iron stone in one
3pl9efpwxwi_4-3-rgb_front if you have one pattern or your just collecting cups and saucers you can display just the cups and saucers its really a subjective thing so it is whatever what you decide to collect
3pl9efpwxwi_5-3-rgb_front and however much room you have to display these things is really up to you
3quvjuyypfc_0-5-rgb_front here to talk about how to choose a motorcycle for a beginner
3quvjuyypfc_1-5-rgb_front i am standing over a dirt bike cause i feel it is a great idea to learn how to ride on a off road bike or dirt bike reason being is because they are they are smaller displacement their smaller in size but yet they mimic a street bike exactly as far as the way the clutch operates the gear shifter operates and where the brake and control locations are
3quvjuyypfc_2-5-rgb_front this so it is a great bike to learn how to ride on and if you simple accidents or if a layover is just minor plastic repair and opposed to a street motorcycle which can cost thousands of dollars for a simple layover
3quvjuyypfc_3-5-rgb_front other things that you can do is check with your local dealer and your local state sponsored motorcycle safety riding courses which may be able to provide a motorcycle for you to learn on
3quvjuyypfc_4-5-rgb_front when choosing to buy a motorcycle after you have learned how to ride already you simply need to ask yourself what type of ride am i going to be doing if i am going to be doing touring riding highway riding simple commuting or just around town all of these will factor into what type of motorcycle you would want to purchase
3quvjuyypfc_5-5-rgb_front obviously starting off you would want a smaller displacement motorcycle that you know you can get comfortable on learn how to ride that one properly and then of course you can always upgrade to a larger displacement motorcycle once you are comfortable on that particular model
3rqjnxownym_0-8-rgb_front laura banford now i am going to show you some miscellaneous knives and their uses
3rqjnxownym_1-8-rgb_front this is a cheese knife and it is used not for a soft but for a or hard cheese to make slices
3rqjnxownym_10-8-rgb_front now for something completely different i am going to make some segments in a piece of citrus this is an orange
3rqjnxownym_11-8-rgb_front not special in any way but i peeled it
3rqjnxownym_12-8-rgb_front i have my nice long pointy vegetable knife
3rqjnxownym_13-8-rgb_front and i want to make segments which means i want to get the fruit out from between the white pith
3rqjnxownym_14-8-rgb_front i am just going to go along the pith as you would to go along the skin of something to to lose any flesh but to separate the segment
3rqjnxownym_15-8-rgb_front there you go
3rqjnxownym_16-8-rgb_front look at that beautiful
3rqjnxownym_17-8-rgb_front let is do it again
3rqjnxownym_18-8-rgb_front let is pick a nicer one right here
3rqjnxownym_19-8-rgb_front got to go just inside the white pith and all you want is the flesh
3rqjnxownym_2-8-rgb_front this is a jarlsberg cheese nice switzerland swiss cheese
3rqjnxownym_20-8-rgb_front now you are going to make a fruit cocktail or an ambrosia you know that old fashioned retro dish with marshmallows and fruit
3rqjnxownym_21-8-rgb_front are not that beautiful
3rqjnxownym_22-8-rgb_front and you want to separate the segments
3rqjnxownym_23-8-rgb_front here we go
3rqjnxownym_3-8-rgb_front i am going to cut the rind of the top of it
3rqjnxownym_4-8-rgb_front just get rid of it and show you how i would make a nice slice
3rqjnxownym_5-8-rgb_front nice nice thin slice with my cheese knife
3rqjnxownym_6-8-rgb_front there are other kinds of cheese knives but this is for a block cheese like a cheddar or a swiss
3rqjnxownym_7-8-rgb_front like a nice uniform cut
3rqjnxownym_8-8-rgb_front now you can slap that on a sandwich and make a grilled cheese with it or just add a cheese plate out of it
3rqjnxownym_9-8-rgb_front still one more and you are basically doing a downward movement a fluid downward movement no rocking no sawing with your cheese knife
3rzgph5hg3i_1-5-rgb_front what we want to talk about now is once the running back takes the hand off he first wants to go through the hole that he is assigned
3rzgph5hg3i_10-5-rgb_front they want to get the running back to go as far outside as possible so they can make the tackle outside
3rzgph5hg3i_11-5-rgb_front so he has to make a decision either he goes through the hole he is assigned or he tries to cut it back up inside on the left or right
3rzgph5hg3i_12-5-rgb_front he has to make a quick decision
3rzgph5hg3i_13-5-rgb_front the main thing is we want to get the ball north and south not east and west
3rzgph5hg3i_2-5-rgb_front every time in the huddle the running back will get an assignment of which hole he is supposed to go through
3rzgph5hg3i_3-5-rgb_front is he supposed to go through the three is he supposed to go up the zero hole right behind the center or is he supposed to go around the outside off tackle
3rzgph5hg3i_4-5-rgb_front once he has that assignment that is always his first option once he takes the ball
3rzgph5hg3i_5-5-rgb_front however sometimes the linemen do not get their jobs done and that is to open up that hole
3rzgph5hg3i_6-5-rgb_front sometimes if the running back is assignment was to go up the three hole and he finds out once he starts to step up and that three hole is closed
3rzgph5hg3i_7-5-rgb_front he can not start dancing around and try to run outside and sweep around
3rzgph5hg3i_8-5-rgb_front usually if this hole is not open he can usually find another one close by but he has to get the ball up field instead of stretching it out
3rzgph5hg3i_9-5-rgb_front that is what the defense wants to do
3s3cgwiqgvk_0-5-rgb_front now i am ready to make the backing of our picture frame
3s3cgwiqgvk_1-5-rgb_front we are going to be using a second piece of cardboard of carton for this
3s3cgwiqgvk_10_11-5-rgb_front so make sure you left enough room around the edges the outer edges of your picture frame so now once i have drawn the outlines on the back of the picture frame i go ahead and cut around the edges being left with a square piece of cardboard that is going to sit right onto the back of the picture and make up the backing of the picture frame
3s3cgwiqgvk_12-5-rgb_front we see now that the backing that we have cut fits right over the picture frame and we have left enough border so that it does not fall through and it also does not show over the edges of the picture frame
3s3cgwiqgvk_13-5-rgb_front and now we go ahead and place the picture in between both pieces of cardboard and cover it with the plastic and we will have a nice seal for our picture frame
3s3cgwiqgvk_14-5-rgb_front so now i have shown you how to make a backing for the picture frame
3s3cgwiqgvk_2-5-rgb_front the way i get the size of the backing is i measure the space in the picture frame the hole that is in the middle that i have cut for the picture and i increase the size by a quarter of an inch
3s3cgwiqgvk_3-5-rgb_front so whatever the size is i add a quarter of an inch around the entire border first on the left side and the right side then i measure the top and the bottom
3s3cgwiqgvk_4-5-rgb_front and i also add a quarter of an inch whatever the size is
3s3cgwiqgvk_5-5-rgb_front and once i have those measurements i go and take my second piece of cardboard and make my points using the same measurements that i just took from the inside of the picture frame
3s3cgwiqgvk_6-5-rgb_front and i make a line
3s3cgwiqgvk_7-5-rgb_front so once i have drawn my lines and i have the outline of the back that i want to use for the picture frame i can go ahead and start cutting it down to size
3s3cgwiqgvk_8-5-rgb_front of course when making the image of your picture frame the actual drawing you have to make sure that you leave this quarter of an inch around all sides of the picture without getting too close to the end of the picture frame
3s3cgwiqgvk_9-5-rgb_front because you are going to need that extra space so that it hangs over and actually covers the picture from the back
3sdn4slso7g_1_2-5-rgb_front in this segment we are going to talk about avoiding a lemon you want to get stuck with a car that breaks down a lot so finding out about any service records and finding out whether the car has been in an accident finding out how the car was before you got it is a real good indicator of whether or not you will purchase yourself a lemon
3sdn4slso7g_3-5-rgb_front forget to look for all those issues and small little things that could cause your car to break down continuously
3sdn4slso7g_4-5-rgb_front in some states they offer a lemon law warranty on a new car so if there are problems with that car when it was new it should have been taken off the market before it comes to you as a used car but that is not true in all states
3sdn4slso7g_5-5-rgb_front so buyer beware make sure that you really do some investigative work to find out whether or not your car is the quality that you are looking for or is it just another lemon
3sd2krf-fvo_0-5-rgb_front okay so maybe you noticed when we were doing that very simple arpeggiated fingerpicking that the first beat of every measure is actually the low note in the chord
3sd2krf-fvo_1-5-rgb_front what we call that in music is the root note of the chord
3sd2krf-fvo_10-5-rgb_front your thumb is playing the root notes of the chords that you are fingering with your left hand
3sd2krf-fvo_11-5-rgb_front so but the thing with the root notes is when you are playing a chord on a guitar that root might be on the low e string it might be on the a string or it might be on the d string
3sd2krf-fvo_12-5-rgb_front and so that is why for fingerpicking style i like to kind of dedicate my thumb to all three of those strings because the root could depending on the chord could kind of be in any one of them
3sd2krf-fvo_13-5-rgb_front so for example for an e chord the root is on the low e so if i was to arpeggiate that you know i would pluck the low e with my thumb
3sd2krf-fvo_14-5-rgb_front but for an a the root is on the a string which is one string up
3sd2krf-fvo_15-5-rgb_front okay
3sd2krf-fvo_16-5-rgb_front well i still want to use my thumb for that because kind of one of the basics of fingerpicking is that you kind of dedicate your thumb to the low notes
3sd2krf-fvo_17-5-rgb_front so for an a the root is here
3sd2krf-fvo_18-5-rgb_front so just kind of keep that in mind as you are learning to fingerpick is where is the root of the chord what note is that and you might want to have your thumb dedicated to those roots
3sd2krf-fvo_2-5-rgb_front and so what that means is is if you are playing a c chord the root is of the low c of that chord or it is basically the first note in a c scale that that chord is based on
3sd2krf-fvo_3-5-rgb_front so the root of the c chord is the c the root of an e chord is e and etcetera
3sd2krf-fvo_4-5-rgb_front it is kind of elementary
3sd2krf-fvo_5-5-rgb_front but musically you want to play that root note kind of at the beginning of any fingerpicking sequence
3sd2krf-fvo_6-5-rgb_front so if we go back to the blue moon every sort of chord starts with the root
3sd2krf-fvo_7-5-rgb_front so if i am going right so that is going c a f g those are the actual chords i am playing and that is actually the note that is being played as that low note that root with each of those picking sequences
3sd2krf-fvo_8-5-rgb_front okay
3sd2krf-fvo_9-5-rgb_front so that is really what your thumb is doing when you are fingerpicking
3tkksl9oyag_0-5-rgb_front now that the eyes and skin are done the finishing touch is the lips
3tkksl9oyag_1-5-rgb_front i am going to use one of the pink powders which was the same kind of mauve color i used on her lid
3tkksl9oyag_10-5-rgb_front that is completely up to you
3tkksl9oyag_11-5-rgb_front for her she is got nice big plump lips so i am just going to do the lip gloss without the lip liner
3tkksl9oyag_12-5-rgb_front look how pretty that is
3tkksl9oyag_13-5-rgb_front very very neutral
3tkksl9oyag_14-5-rgb_front take any of these powders
3tkksl9oyag_15-5-rgb_front this would be good a blush too a really sheer pink blush
3tkksl9oyag_16-5-rgb_front if you have a pink gloss you love but you just want to add some oomph to it you do not have to use a clear
3tkksl9oyag_17-5-rgb_front you can use any color
3tkksl9oyag_18-5-rgb_front if you have a nude lip gloss that you want a little more pink this is the time where you can experiment and mix and match
3tkksl9oyag_19-5-rgb_front i just want it a little more glossy so i am going to add a little more gloss
3tkksl9oyag_2-5-rgb_front i am going to mix that with a clear lip gloss and we are going to use that as lip gloss or lipstick
3tkksl9oyag_20-5-rgb_front i really used very little powder
3tkksl9oyag_21-5-rgb_front just enough to give a bit of a color
3tkksl9oyag_22-5-rgb_front look how pretty that is
3tkksl9oyag_23-5-rgb_front we just invented a new lip gloss
3tkksl9oyag_3-5-rgb_front again you can use the back of your hand
3tkksl9oyag_4-5-rgb_front you can use a petri dish a plate anything just to mix it
3tkksl9oyag_5-5-rgb_front you just want to take a little bit of powder at a time and mix it with the clear gloss until you get your desired color
3tkksl9oyag_6-5-rgb_front this is a natural look so i do not want it too pinky
3tkksl9oyag_7-5-rgb_front i just want it really natural
3tkksl9oyag_8-5-rgb_front i am going to add a little more lip gloss
3tkksl9oyag_9-5-rgb_front you can use lip liner if you want also
3tmrgnyryqw_0-5-rgb_front joe wiles we are coming in with which is the house of the rising sun by the animals
3tmrgnyryqw_1-5-rgb_front let is take a lot at the guitar
3tmrgnyryqw_10-5-rgb_front now get very familiar with those chords
3tmrgnyryqw_11-5-rgb_front make sure you can switch between them with some fluency okay
3tmrgnyryqw_12-5-rgb_front in the next segment we are going to put them altogether in order in the progression of this song with kind of an interesting strumming pattern okay
3tmrgnyryqw_13-5-rgb_front i will see you in that segment
3tmrgnyryqw_2-5-rgb_front now before we begin this song you are going to want to be familiar with a few chords
3tmrgnyryqw_3-5-rgb_front the first one is an a minor chord
3tmrgnyryqw_4-5-rgb_front it is an open a string fret on the d string fret on the g string fret on the b string and the open high e string strum from the a string down okay
3tmrgnyryqw_5-5-rgb_front next one is going to be a c major chord fret on the a string fret on the d string open fret on the b string and the open high e the next one is going to a d major chord
3tmrgnyryqw_6-5-rgb_front open d string fret on the g string fret on the b string and fret on the high e string
3tmrgnyryqw_7-5-rgb_front next one is going to be a f major chord fret on the d string right here fret on the g string and then with your index finger pad both the frets of the b and the e string okay
3tmrgnyryqw_8-5-rgb_front the last one you want to know is an e major chord
3tmrgnyryqw_9-5-rgb_front open low e string fret on the a string fret on the d string index finger with your fret on the g string then open b open e okay
3trdv2ix-cy_1-5-rgb_front on this particular manikin i would not recommend pulling her through a cap
3trdv2ix-cy_10-5-rgb_front you just dip that into your product and you just paint it on where you want it
3trdv2ix-cy_11-5-rgb_front a lot of times it is great to use in the bang area or around your face and you just grab out that piece of hair take the product begin where you want and just bring it back down
3trdv2ix-cy_12-5-rgb_front just remember that around the midshaft of the hair you are going to want to dip the wand back in and reapply
3trdv2ix-cy_13-5-rgb_front because otherwise you are going to get a really bright spot here and not so bright here and it will not look very natural
3trdv2ix-cy_14-5-rgb_front now a days a lot of the highlights are starting to get away from looking natural so you can get away with that
3trdv2ix-cy_15-5-rgb_front another thing that you can consider doing is not so much lightening so close to the scalp
3trdv2ix-cy_16-5-rgb_front try starting just at the ends and just ending just getting your tips light or having it look like it is just grown out highlights from the summer
3trdv2ix-cy_17-5-rgb_front so all you have to do is just take your mascara wand and just paint it on wherever you want it and then let it process
3trdv2ix-cy_18-5-rgb_front and that is one technique for long hair
3trdv2ix-cy_19-5-rgb_front short hair like i said you would want to put the cap on the head and then use your hook and just pull the hair through
3trdv2ix-cy_2-5-rgb_front like let is say this was my head i would be very upset if someone tried to put a cap on me and pull me through because that means this strand of hair to come through this hole all the way
3trdv2ix-cy_20-5-rgb_front and those are a couple of techniques that you can use for different lengths of hair
3trdv2ix-cy_3-5-rgb_front and you tend to get spots because as you are pulling on that cap it is becoming looser on your head so you tend to get spots
3trdv2ix-cy_4-5-rgb_front if you have got super short hair the cap is the way to go
3trdv2ix-cy_5-5-rgb_front but for longer hair i highly recommend using a brush and a bowl
3trdv2ix-cy_6-5-rgb_front and you can just section your hair off grab some hair and you can use foil wax paper you could even just paint it on
3trdv2ix-cy_7-5-rgb_front and you take your product and you just paint it on the hair
3trdv2ix-cy_8-5-rgb_front now let is say you do not have foil you could take a piece of cotton and just lay it underneath so that way it stays off the hair underneath it and let it just process naturally

3uvzt6quuda_0-5-rgb_front so lisa go over some healthier sugar choices
3uvzt6quuda_1-5-rgb_front yeah some sugar alternatives sugar alternatives when cooking or baking or preparing meals for kids exactly well we all know that white sugar is like evil the devil so we have some other nice alternatives that they are out there cause we all have a sweet tooth we all want a little sugar in our life and fine and nothing wrong with that just as long as you do it everyday great even if the healthy alternatives still better to at least every other day at the very most
3uvzt6quuda_2-5-rgb_front we do have right here stevia is going to probably be the best alternative it bake very well unfortunately but you can add to shakes and all that other stuff just sprinkle on cereal or anything like that actually a plant leaf been finely ground and it has zero sugars or anything else like that so it works really really well and it raise your sugar levels at all so probably the best choice
3uvzt6quuda_3-5-rgb_front say probably the next ones that we have are we have the agave syrup and we have the barley malt and then we have muscovado sugar and then of course the molasses these are great sugar substitutes right here obviously they do have sugar in them so they do raise your sugar levels but other nutrients in these it actually helps your body metabolize and digest the sugars much better
3uvzt6quuda_4-5-rgb_front because when you have just white sugar it basically robs and leaches your body of minerals and vitamins that you need and what happens it makes you more tired it gives you that energy and you crash exactly it spikes up the sugar levels gives you the energy but then you crash and if you keep doing that your body is being around constantly
3uvzt6quuda_5-5-rgb_front now barley malt is very good for baking yes this is a good thing to bake with exactly so is the muscovado sugar and muscovado sugar is basically a different way of making the white sugars actually been all the nutrients have been taken away and the muscovado sugar is basically what white sugar would become what this would become would be white sugar this has all its nutrients and minerals and vitamins already with it so way better than the white sugar and it cooks really well too
3uvzt6quuda_6-5-rgb_front black strap molasses has a little iron is this good this is a very good sugar to use for baking especially and if you like those molasses cookies there you go
3uvzt6quuda_7-5-rgb_front yeah and you know what when my daughter was a little anemic i put a little bit of this in her oatmeal oh there you go and mixed it in and that helped her a lot with the hemoglobin and the iron problem there you go so we hope that incorporate some of these sugar alternatives and give them a try
3wewtzhf8ki_0-5-rgb_front well are you in like or are you in love
3wewtzhf8ki_1-5-rgb_front how do you know if you love him
3wewtzhf8ki_10-5-rgb_front or are you in love with him

3ake_fh3jaq_1-8-rgb_front how to grip the racquet is very important it is going to help you in different shots for a specific shot

3bw1rcf2zry_0-3-rgb_front how are you
3bw1rcf2zry_1-3-rgb_front jeff klein here vodka connoisseur and resident bartender here at beak is old florida in st petersburg
3bw1rcf2zry_10-3-rgb_front whether with cranberry juice soda water or just by itself on the rocks or as a martini
3bw1rcf2zry_11-3-rgb_front it gives you that little bit of flavor while keeping that crisp vodka that you like
3bw1rcf2zry_12-3-rgb_front so once again my name is jeff klein vodka connoisseur and bartender here at beak is old florida and that is the best smirnoff vodka
3bw1rcf2zry_2-3-rgb_front and i am going to tell you about the best smirnoff vodka
3bw1rcf2zry_3-3-rgb_front now there is a lot of different flavors and smirnoff has been around for awhile obviously
3bw1rcf2zry_4-3-rgb_front my favorite though is the classic
3bw1rcf2zry_5-3-rgb_front just your red label eighty proof smirnoff vodka
3bw1rcf2zry_6-3-rgb_front it is consistently ranked in the top ten over the past over the past decade
3bw1rcf2zry_7-3-rgb_front and there is a clean crisp flavor to it that can not be beat
3bw1rcf2zry_8-3-rgb_front now if you are somebody who cares for maybe a little something sweeter when they are drinking i would recommend the blueberry flavored smirnoff
3bw1rcf2zry_9-3-rgb_front it is a nice flavor it is not to sweet and it is extremely versatile
3dcgoouxzby_0-8-rgb_front so after you have started with the this pattern some of the most common problems that people have is they might catch a stick too close to the center so it turns over probably would not be as pretty as that or they catch the stick to close to the end so it turns over too fast
3dcgoouxzby_1-8-rgb_front what you really want to do is find the ideal point probably pretty close to the end that knock back and forth and spins the stick just around the center point around this middle point of the stick right there
3dcgoouxzby_10-8-rgb_front then we will move on from there
3dcgoouxzby_2-8-rgb_front now one way to clean up your pattern a lot is use both sticks
3dcgoouxzby_3-8-rgb_front so instead of just controlling the crystal stick at the top of its throw you should also push down on the bottom with your other stick like this
3dcgoouxzby_4-8-rgb_front now if you notices the stick the crystal stick is actually doing the same thing whether i do this or whether i do this
3dcgoouxzby_5-8-rgb_front it really should not change
3dcgoouxzby_6-8-rgb_front all that is happening is that i am getting a little more control over the stick because i have two of my control stick in contact with it instead of just one like this
3dcgoouxzby_7-8-rgb_front now this will definitely help you when you start moving into other patterns because your going to be able to place this bottom stick just correctly and move into other spins and things like that
3dcgoouxzby_8-8-rgb_front so in review i want you to practice this and try to get that timing as close as possible
3dcgoouxzby_9-8-rgb_front get this pattern down and start doing it with both sticks just like this on either side of the center point
3dfkahxy0ki_0-5-rgb_front hi i am gretchen rivas with relax to the max massage therapy and today we are going to talk about how to do a couples foot massage
3dfkahxy0ki_1-5-rgb_front of course you can do this in a number of different ways but you know if you are sitting on the couch watching tv there is no reason why you can not rub each others feet at the same time
3dfkahxy0ki_2-5-rgb_front i personally prefer to get mine rubbed just alone but since we are going to be nice today and share we are both working on each others feet at the same time but it depends on how tall you are and how tall your partner is as to how well it is going to work
3dfkahxy0ki_3-5-rgb_front somebody might have to bend a little bit more than the other but it can be done and the thing is you do not have to have any special massage oil or special stuff to do anything like this you can just use a little bit of vegetable oil from the kitchen and rub each others feet and it will make each other feel really good and you might enjoy the movie just a little bit more
3dfkahxy0ki_4-5-rgb_front that is what we do when we do a couples massage
3dfkahxy0ki_5-5-rgb_front of course you want to massage the bottoms of the feet if you are working with your partner and if you think you are better at it than he is then you can tell him some things that you want him to do
3dfkahxy0ki_6-5-rgb_front massage the toes massage the tops of the feet massage around the ankles a little bit where it feels good especially around the achilles tendon and then when you are done with that foot you can work on the other foot and that is how we do a couples feet massage
3do7bi93adu_0-5-rgb_front the most important thing is probably to know when your team is playing
3do7bi93adu_1-5-rgb_front if you have chosen a team maybe you are new to baseball but you have chosen a team you have got to know where to find their schedule
3do7bi93adu_10-5-rgb_front that is kind of ticketing and scheduling in a nutshell
3do7bi93adu_11-5-rgb_front but obviously keep track of that schedule and it is very important
3do7bi93adu_12-5-rgb_front if you play fantasy sports another great way to keep track of the schedule
3do7bi93adu_2-5-rgb_front and i will say the easiest place is just to go to their team website
3do7bi93adu_3-5-rgb_front be the most up to date if times have changed if venues have changed if for some reason they have got to flop around the schedule a little bit because there is a concert at some stadium they did not expect or there is a national emergency that they did not expect and they have got to switch things around that team website is going to be the most up to date
3do7bi93adu_4-5-rgb_front and also it is very important to look at that schedule because let is say you do have kids you have got to make sure that you have that opportunity to schedule for the summer
3do7bi93adu_5-5-rgb_front maybe you can take a week off and go see a series of four or five games against a great team and have that opportunity to kind of show up
3do7bi93adu_6-5-rgb_front so it is very important to look at the schedule ahead of time and kind of plan it out
3do7bi93adu_7-5-rgb_front and i will say teams like the red sox yankees sell out fast so it is important to look at the schedule ahead of time
3do7bi93adu_8-5-rgb_front if you want to see them you have got to get those tickets early
3do7bi93adu_9-5-rgb_front it will be hard to wait until the last second because most likely it will be sold out
3daeolnr8_a_0-5-rgb_front we are here today to talk about health concerns relating to the litter box
3daeolnr8_a_1-5-rgb_front the number one concern really when it comes to the litter box is usually for pregnant women or people with a compromised immune system
3daeolnr8_a_10-5-rgb_front you still want to handle the litter box with care
3daeolnr8_a_11-5-rgb_front particularly for a person who has any kind of health concern to really want to make sure that you are maintaining an immaculate litter box
3daeolnr8_a_12-5-rgb_front that means like this is a brand new litter box
3daeolnr8_a_13-5-rgb_front i like to change out my litter box about once every six months because even if you are using bleach to disinfect it you still the cat can scratch the plastic and get these little grooves and crevices where bacteria can build up
3daeolnr8_a_14-5-rgb_front so you want to change out that litter box
3daeolnr8_a_15-5-rgb_front in the meanwhile you know there is lots of different kinds of litter that have lots of different claims
3daeolnr8_a_16-5-rgb_front scoopable litters
3daeolnr8_a_17-5-rgb_front lots of scoopable litters will say you do not have to change litter for except for like once a month
3daeolnr8_a_18-5-rgb_front you just want to take a scoop and scoop out the solids and the chunks of that form from the urine
3daeolnr8_a_19-5-rgb_front the problem with that is even though you are getting rid of all the solids they still leave bacteria behind
3daeolnr8_a_2-5-rgb_front the thing that most people are concerned with is toxoplasmosis
3daeolnr8_a_20-5-rgb_front so i strongly recommend that you go ahead and change out the entire litter but you know change out all of the litter at least once a week at the very least every other week
3daeolnr8_a_21-5-rgb_front depending on your cat is usage and how many litter boxes you have in the house
3daeolnr8_a_22-5-rgb_front but mainly to keep down the amount of bacteria that is going to build up in the box
3daeolnr8_a_23-5-rgb_front you are going to want to mix up a ten percent bleach solution
3daeolnr8_a_24-5-rgb_front so that means for every one part bleach you have ten parts water
3daeolnr8_a_25-5-rgb_front and use that
3daeolnr8_a_26-5-rgb_front put that in the bucket
3daeolnr8_a_27-5-rgb_front add some water
3daeolnr8_a_28-5-rgb_front then what you can do is pour that bleach solution into your empty litter box
3daeolnr8_a_29-5-rgb_front have a dedicated brush
3daeolnr8_a_3-5-rgb_front for a pregnant woman the contracts toxolasmosis which they can contract through handling cat feces
3daeolnr8_a_30-5-rgb_front maybe even a dedicated bucket
3daeolnr8_a_31-5-rgb_front that is just for that
3daeolnr8_a_32-5-rgb_front because you certainly do not want to end up doing your dishes with it
3daeolnr8_a_33-5-rgb_front and give it a nice scrub scrub scrub and then you can pour the solution down the sink
3daeolnr8_a_34-5-rgb_front and i sometimes actually do this outside because i am not so crazy about getting and cat feces in my kitchen area
3daeolnr8_a_35-5-rgb_front but anyway then you will have a nice disinfected box
3daeolnr8_a_36-5-rgb_front the other thing you can do is eave it outdoors to dry out in the sun
3daeolnr8_a_37-5-rgb_front and the sun is a great disinfectant
3daeolnr8_a_38-5-rgb_front before you fill it up and bring it back in the house
3daeolnr8_a_39-5-rgb_front and now you have a clean litter box
3daeolnr8_a_4-5-rgb_front the major concerns are still birth a miscarriage birth defects and probably the scariest of all the possibilities is that your child can contract schizophrenia through exposure to toxoplasmosis
3daeolnr8_a_5-5-rgb_front however the good news is that you can have your cat tested for toxoplasmosis
3daeolnr8_a_6-5-rgb_front which means you can take the cat to the vet run a blood test to see if your cat actually has toxoplasmosis
3daeolnr8_a_7-5-rgb_front toxoplasmosis is pretty rare and odds are your cat does not have toxoplasmosis
3daeolnr8_a_8-5-rgb_front and then for the duration of your pregnancy if you keep the cat indoors it is almost impossible that the cat is going contract it
3daeolnr8_a_9-5-rgb_front even if toxoplasmosis is really not a concern for you because your cat is into carrier and your cat is kept indoors
3epphbg88ce_0-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about you know the proper set up procedures when you are inflating your kite and how to really designate whether or not this is the right place to do it and you know just the general procedures about it
3epphbg88ce_1-5-rgb_front each kite all these companies use different specific systems where you know you are going to be inflating the kite
3epphbg88ce_10-5-rgb_front one thing to look for before you start pumping is make sure your bridles these things right here are not wrapped around the wingtips of the kite
3epphbg88ce_11-5-rgb_front sometimes if you inflate the kite all the way and you know for instance this is just totally wrapped up into it you just made this into a rigid structure and it is got a line that is completely just sort of twisted around it and just one little gust in the wrong direction and it can just serrate it right apart
3epphbg88ce_12-5-rgb_front so what we are going to do is we are going to attach our pump leash to the connection point that is provided on the kite
3epphbg88ce_13-5-rgb_front different companies like i said use different systems
3epphbg88ce_14-5-rgb_front this is a slingshot rev and as you can see right here on the dump valve there is a perfect place where you can attach the pump leash right there
3epphbg88ce_15-5-rgb_front so first thing we do right there attach that
3epphbg88ce_16-5-rgb_front and you know sometimes if it is really windy even go the extra step like put the bridle around your leg or just get somebody to hold the kite while you pump it up
3epphbg88ce_17-5-rgb_front you want to make sure because this is a kite all these struts right here that is what these are called these sorts of rib shaped things that are going to provide structure for your kite
3epphbg88ce_18-5-rgb_front you want to make sure those are unclipped and ready to accept air
3epphbg88ce_19-5-rgb_front if they are clipped you are going to pump up your whole kite and then all of a sudden you are going to unclip that and you know you are going to have to repump your kite up
3epphbg88ce_2-5-rgb_front right here these are the dump valve so obviously before you start pumping up your kite you are going to want to put that up
3epphbg88ce_20-5-rgb_front so to make sure this all goes down in one smooth swift motion open up all your valves make sure your dump valve is closed sealed and definitely put this extra velcro strap on it because you do not want that popping off out there
3epphbg88ce_21-5-rgb_front and then you can go ahead insert your nozzle and you can see there is a little ball right down in there so this is technically a nozzle
3epphbg88ce_22-5-rgb_front but sometimes you have got to be a little extra fast and quick when you are plugging this out
3epphbg88ce_23-5-rgb_front you just take it put your finger over and then cut it off velcro down and then now we have this really cool little slingshot patented clip that we can actually stick right here to make sure our valve is going to stay down
3epphbg88ce_24-5-rgb_front i have personally done a five mile swim in from the water because i did not have one of these things and the rubber and the velcro wore off
3epphbg88ce_25-5-rgb_front i am out there and my kite deflated
3epphbg88ce_26-5-rgb_front that is a basic kitemare right there
3epphbg88ce_27-5-rgb_front so make sure when you put your kite together you do it all properly efficiently and you know you do not miss any steps
3epphbg88ce_28-5-rgb_front once you are fully pumped up hit this clip right here to isolate the air in all the struts
3epphbg88ce_29-5-rgb_front that way in the event that you do get into a kitemare out there you know you get a slash in your leading edge even just a slow leak something starts to lose air you are going to isolate air into all these compartments so you are immediately going to have a flotation aid that is going to allow you get back onto shore safely
3epphbg88ce_3-5-rgb_front and something you are definitely need for this whole procedure here is a pump
3epphbg88ce_30-5-rgb_front so
3epphbg88ce_4-5-rgb_front it is definitely a funny thing when you come out to the beach and you see some guy sitting there and he is about to pass out because he is been trying to blow up his kite with his mouth
3epphbg88ce_5-5-rgb_front so first things first you know make sure you have your gear and make sure you have taken a lesson so you know how to do this
3epphbg88ce_6-5-rgb_front but you know get your pump and you are going to want to set your kite up perfectly in orientation to the wind
3epphbg88ce_7-5-rgb_front so right now it feels a little bit windier
3epphbg88ce_8-5-rgb_front i could probably just hold this out and the kite would just unravel on its own and everything would just be immediately swept downwind
3epphbg88ce_9-5-rgb_front so that is the best way to set the kite up
3fizqvmucs4_0-5-rgb_front in this clip on how to audition for a broadway play i am going to talk about how to pick an appropriate monologue for a specific audition that you are going to
3fizqvmucs4_1-5-rgb_front if we continue on this example of three changes by nicky silver and i am going in for steffi mid to late twenties garish somewhat young woman works at the clinique and romantically involved with nate
3fizqvmucs4_10-5-rgb_front can this monologue be turned into this character a little bit
3fizqvmucs4_11-5-rgb_front you know you might have a monologue about washing your clothes but if you do it in a garish romantic somewhat way suddenly you are steffi
3fizqvmucs4_12-5-rgb_front so find that monologue but also transform that monologue into the character
3fizqvmucs4_2-5-rgb_front so i am going to find because it is look at the playwright nicky silver
3fizqvmucs4_3-5-rgb_front this is a comedic contemporary playwright you know very wordy the humor is in the words
3fizqvmucs4_4-5-rgb_front it is very clever and wordy so i would definitely pick a contemporary comedic monologue
3fizqvmucs4_5-5-rgb_front i could even do another nick nicky silver monologue
3fizqvmucs4_6-5-rgb_front it is good to have a nicky silver in your repertoire if it fits you
3fizqvmucs4_7-5-rgb_front so she plays something romantic
3fizqvmucs4_8-5-rgb_front it might be good to pick something that involves a monologue that talks about romance something a little romantic
3fizqvmucs4_9-5-rgb_front even if you have a monologue that is about something completely different i mean open your mind and think outside the box
3frkrywxdho_0-8-rgb_front you have chose the kit that you want to use to highlight your hair to put blond in your hair and each one has a different process
3frkrywxdho_1-8-rgb_front so you want to make sure you have read the directions and in this process when it comes with a bottle like this which there are several brands that come this way when you comb this through your hair you want to do section by section comb it through your hair and do not retouch that hair let it lightly lay on top of the next level and then do the next section of hair and then comb it through the next section
3frkrywxdho_2-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that you have not full coverage it is a very light coverage on this so they actually look like highlights that are laying on your hair
3frkrywxdho_3-8-rgb_front with this process where you have the brush it is a similar process
3frkrywxdho_4-8-rgb_front again with one section not touching the other you want to come it through the hair
3frkrywxdho_5-8-rgb_front go to your next section of your hair comb it through again and do not comb those sections together so they do not touch each other
3frkrywxdho_6-8-rgb_front once they have touched each other and you have combed them or mushed the color together you have actually now have a glob of hair
3frkrywxdho_7-8-rgb_front this process where you have the brush it is better to use the brush at this type of an angle going down your hair like this and then you will have those really pretty blond streaks like the sun would give you
3frkrywxdho_8-8-rgb_front and so those are some little tips on how to get proper highlights so they look more natural
3hohkub8qzs_0-3-rgb_front alright we are talking about medium stiffness boots
3hohkub8qzs_1-3-rgb_front medium stiffness boots are in the range of four to seven pretty much
3hohkub8qzs_2-3-rgb_front boot manufacturers have a rating scale usually one to ten but a lot of them have different ways to rate how soft their boots are
3hohkub8qzs_3-3-rgb_front mid boots are probably best if you are just starting i would say because they are in between soft and hard
3hohkub8qzs_4-3-rgb_front but once again i would say go to your shop try them on ask them how long it takes to break in for that boot manufacturer they will let you know
3hohkub8qzs_5-3-rgb_front try them on make sure they are comfortable
3hohkub8qzs_6-3-rgb_front ask them how long they take before they really start breaking down cause if you ride a lot boots go pretty quickly
3hohkub8qzs_7-3-rgb_front ask them if they are a warm boot or not because your feet will get cold
3hohkub8qzs_8-3-rgb_front and you should find out because you might want to return your boots if they do not keep your feet warm
3hohkub8qzs_9-3-rgb_front there is many different other things but i am discovering the main what type of boot your looking for for what type of riding that you want to do
3i7jj7jll5o_0-5-rgb_front we just cut on our jeans we cut the whole waistline out
3i7jj7jll5o_1-5-rgb_front did not undo the belt loops yet
3i7jj7jll5o_10-5-rgb_front okay we are going to want to do that to every single belt loop
3i7jj7jll5o_11-5-rgb_front try to keep this part of the belt loop on if you cut above this when you try to put a belt through it when you reattach it it is not going to fit
3i7jj7jll5o_12-5-rgb_front so go ahead and undo all your belt loops and we will move on to the next step
3i7jj7jll5o_2-5-rgb_front i am going to undo just the bottom of the belt loops for now
3i7jj7jll5o_3-5-rgb_front we will do that the same way
3i7jj7jll5o_4-5-rgb_front we are going to keep the belt loops because we are going to those on for the last step
3i7jj7jll5o_5-5-rgb_front with your knife take the bottom of all of them and the belt loops they are really kind of tricky so you have got to be really kind of careful
3i7jj7jll5o_6-5-rgb_front just try to pry it a little at a time with the razor blade
3i7jj7jll5o_7-5-rgb_front you want to do this to every single one of them
3i7jj7jll5o_8-5-rgb_front there we go so we have got one side all the way out
3i7jj7jll5o_9-5-rgb_front then turn it back over so you can do the other side
3lexstvqb9m_1-8-rgb_front next thing we want to talk about is we continue to talk about controlling the ball using your chest to do a chest trap
3lexstvqb9m_10-8-rgb_front trap and do not even let the ball hit the ground valley it right back to the person
3lexstvqb9m_11-8-rgb_front nice and in control and nice pass
3lexstvqb9m_2-8-rgb_front what you want to do with the chest trap is as you see the ball coming in you want to get it into your chest and drop it to the ground again so you can step and make a good pass
3lexstvqb9m_3-8-rgb_front so you watch the ball in it traps drops at your feet
3lexstvqb9m_4-8-rgb_front you do not want the ball to fly off you do not want it to hit at your side and let fly that way or that way you want to stay square to the ball as it comes in moving your feet so that you are square to the ball getting a good trap step and pass
3lexstvqb9m_5-8-rgb_front let is watch this demonstration
3lexstvqb9m_6-8-rgb_front ball goes up traps it right to his feet so he has control of the ball
3lexstvqb9m_7-8-rgb_front notice how he leans back allows the ball to come to him and makes that pass
3lexstvqb9m_8-8-rgb_front he even passes it with his right and left foot
3lexstvqb9m_9-8-rgb_front same thing here as you get better at it you can begin to valley the ball
3lekwl-71yg_0-5-rgb_front this is just an extra tip this happens to me a lot when i m hand sewing when i am using regular thread if there is any moisture in the air or if there is any moisture on your hands what going to happen is the thread is going to start to act up and it is going to tangle itself while you are trying to stitch and there is nothing more annoying than tangled up thread and trying to and having to start over because it knotted in the middle
3lekwl-71yg_1-5-rgb_front so this is a trick that i use there is such a thing called tailors wax
3lekwl-71yg_10-5-rgb_front you will have waxed thread and it will just move through your fabric much simpler
3lekwl-71yg_2-5-rgb_front you can get it at any sewing store or this is wax from a candle
3lekwl-71yg_3-5-rgb_front this works as well too
3lekwl-71yg_4-5-rgb_front what you want to do is just kind of run your thread through that wax just coat the thread with wax and that will really prevent your thread from tangling on you
3lekwl-71yg_5-5-rgb_front you can also find it in a lot of sewing stores packages of thread that are specifically for hand sewing only and there all waxed and there all a little thicker
3lekwl-71yg_6-5-rgb_front they do not come in a spool they come like in a tuft
3lekwl-71yg_7-5-rgb_front almost like if you get fake hair or something
3lekwl-71yg_8-5-rgb_front so you get a bunch of threads and their all waxed and you can use those
3lekwl-71yg_9-5-rgb_front but if you have nothing else and your threads bunching up and it is raining outside or your hands are slightly moist go ahead and take some wax from a candle take some wax that is around just drag it through
3mnaab29c7e_0-5-rgb_front the technique we are working on in this series is a higher level threat than the wrist grabs we worked on earlier
3mnaab29c7e_1-5-rgb_front this situation is when i am actually going to be attacking her with my arm around her neck trying to drag her off to a secondary location
3mnaab29c7e_2-5-rgb_front she will be initiating a defense before i have a chance to get her all the way off of her feet
3mnaab29c7e_3-5-rgb_front so the threat she is facing is i am going to have my hand around her neck locking my hands and starting to pull her backwards
3mnaab29c7e_4-5-rgb_front she is going to take her chin into her shoulder so i do not get under her neck reach her hands up stretch as much as possible and rip the hands down making a gap so i do not get under her neck
3mnaab29c7e_5-5-rgb_front she is going to punch back with her shoulder and her feet making a little space extract her head and then follow with any kind of counter attacks a kick and then make as much distance as possible
3mnaab29c7e_6-5-rgb_front that has to be really really strong
3mjtbgsblhe_0-5-rgb_front allison klinger hello my name is allison at western art glass in salt lake city
3mjtbgsblhe_1-5-rgb_front i am the owner of the store here
3mjtbgsblhe_10-5-rgb_front there is fused glass which means it is made in a kiln and you actually fuse the glass together and create your own glass make bowls plates platters
3mjtbgsblhe_11-5-rgb_front there is torched beads you can make out of glass
3mjtbgsblhe_12-5-rgb_front and today i get to play with foiled glass
3mjtbgsblhe_13-5-rgb_front i get to play with stepping stone glass
3mjtbgsblhe_14-5-rgb_front in fact i get to do whatever i want
3mjtbgsblhe_15-5-rgb_front so you should get involved
3mjtbgsblhe_16-5-rgb_front you will fall in love with it and either which way go to your local stained glass store
3mjtbgsblhe_17-5-rgb_front if you do not have one look it up in the phonebook under glass stained and leaded or look up on the phonebook up on the internet for stained glass
3mjtbgsblhe_18-5-rgb_front and if you do not have one locally drive to one
3mjtbgsblhe_19-5-rgb_front it will all be worth it
3mjtbgsblhe_2-5-rgb_front i teach a variety of classes
3mjtbgsblhe_20-5-rgb_front so check it out
3mjtbgsblhe_3-5-rgb_front i carry tons of stained glass lots of fun stuff
3mjtbgsblhe_4-5-rgb_front i carry all types of tools supplies pattern books
3mjtbgsblhe_5-5-rgb_front we teach so many classes
3mjtbgsblhe_6-5-rgb_front working with glasses is so much fun that once you start it leads to another method okay
3mjtbgsblhe_7-5-rgb_front there is beginning stained glass
3mjtbgsblhe_8-5-rgb_front there is leaded glass
3mjtbgsblhe_9-5-rgb_front there is stepping stones
3ntc51p5qji_1-8-rgb_front now we are going into how to describe a character describing a character in the script
3ntc51p5qji_10-8-rgb_front we describe a type of character
3ntc51p5qji_11-8-rgb_front in addition to that we also develop other aspects of a character we describe the actions they do and this is done in the script
3ntc51p5qji_12-8-rgb_front this is also done in how they do something
3ntc51p5qji_13-8-rgb_front so you could say they move briskly across the stage
3ntc51p5qji_14-8-rgb_front in a line of dialog you can reference how they say it
3ntc51p5qji_15-8-rgb_front they can say something ragefully
3ntc51p5qji_16-8-rgb_front now obviously you are probably going to have the line there that is emphasized
3ntc51p5qji_17-8-rgb_front so this is probably not very important to say but there are ways where you can can influence the way a line is said when it is not very specific
3ntc51p5qji_18-8-rgb_front and these are some of the ways where you can describe who you are character is and what they they are doing give people a general outline on what your character is all about
3ntc51p5qji_2-8-rgb_front okay let is start off with this
3ntc51p5qji_3-8-rgb_front how would you go about describing your character
3ntc51p5qji_4-8-rgb_front well you are going to have people talk about your character but you are also going to have to have some kind of introduction to who your character is
3ntc51p5qji_5-8-rgb_front in that you probably want to keep it pretty brief
3ntc51p5qji_6-8-rgb_front occupation what they do maybe might be incorporated in there
3ntc51p5qji_7-8-rgb_front you want age and maybe a brief description of who they are
3ntc51p5qji_8-8-rgb_front so let is say lazy
3ntc51p5qji_9-8-rgb_front so we have a lazy computer salesman who is years old and that way we develop a type of character
3o7onkjwx7c_0-3-rgb_front the next part of the flamingo you are going to do is his beak
3o7onkjwx7c_1-3-rgb_front you are going to take out your striping brush the black one and wipe off as much polish as you can
3o7onkjwx7c_10-3-rgb_front that way it does not get stringy and then mess up your design
3o7onkjwx7c_11-3-rgb_front once you have gotten the v on all four for the beaks you are ready to go to the next part of your design
3o7onkjwx7c_12-3-rgb_front but that is how you do the beak to the flamingo
3o7onkjwx7c_2-3-rgb_front you want to make sure that there is really just enough polish on there to do the beak
3o7onkjwx7c_3-3-rgb_front at the very tip of your head you are going to do very small v shape
3o7onkjwx7c_4-3-rgb_front that is going to give you the beak to your flamingo
3o7onkjwx7c_5-3-rgb_front you are going to do that to each nail
3o7onkjwx7c_6-3-rgb_front does not have to be an open v it can be a little closed
3o7onkjwx7c_7-3-rgb_front just want to kind of go right along the outside of the pink there to kind of give the shape of his beak
3o7onkjwx7c_8-3-rgb_front that is just going to come down into a small point
3o7onkjwx7c_9-3-rgb_front again you want to make sure that your polish is not too dry on your striper brush
3osvyy2f4zq_0-5-rgb_front okay so we have talked a lot about telescopes here and hopefully we are better educated but how about some help you choose telescopes and what you might consider when you are ready to buy a telescope
3osvyy2f4zq_1-5-rgb_front everything that i see here is under seven hundred dollars
3osvyy2f4zq_10-5-rgb_front remember when light is bounced off a mirror there is no lens or prism to come through so you will not experience that false color
3osvyy2f4zq_11-5-rgb_front this is a goto telescope
3osvyy2f4zq_12-5-rgb_front when we start out with goto telescopes you can get an outstanding scope for under five hundred dollars
3osvyy2f4zq_13-5-rgb_front this is millimeter just over five inches and it is a goto telescope
3osvyy2f4zq_14-5-rgb_front once properly aligned it will find objects it will track objects for you
3osvyy2f4zq_15-5-rgb_front it is like having a little tutor with you as you use the goto setup
3osvyy2f4zq_16-5-rgb_front under five hundred dollars
3osvyy2f4zq_17-5-rgb_front now here is something interesting
3osvyy2f4zq_18-5-rgb_front this little guy is six and this ten inch model here is six as well
3osvyy2f4zq_19-5-rgb_front ten inches of aperture ninety millimeters of aperture
3osvyy2f4zq_2-5-rgb_front cost effective and standouts at their price points and i just want to kind of show you a little bit of the differences here
3osvyy2f4zq_20-5-rgb_front what is the difference
3osvyy2f4zq_21-5-rgb_front why the same price point
3osvyy2f4zq_22-5-rgb_front well the ten inch guy here is a dobsonian i said is the best cost effective way to get lots of aperture
3osvyy2f4zq_23-5-rgb_front it is a manual operation
3osvyy2f4zq_24-5-rgb_front you find objects on your own you track them on your own
3osvyy2f4zq_25-5-rgb_front with the little millimeter here this is a goto telescope so it has more bells and whistles
3osvyy2f4zq_26-5-rgb_front it tracks for you it finds objects for you it is almost as simple as going saturn and have your telescope go there for you
3osvyy2f4zq_27-5-rgb_front so the first thing people usually consider other than price when they are coming in looking for a telescope is portability
3osvyy2f4zq_28-5-rgb_front where they are going to use their telescope will they travel with it and whether or not you want to find objects on your own or if you would like to have a computer hand controller to assist you
3osvyy2f4zq_29-5-rgb_front i have talked to people when i tell them about goto telescopes that you have got to know at least two or three bright stars in the sky to set up your telescope
3osvyy2f4zq_3-5-rgb_front what you can expect to realistically spend to get started what you are going to see and if you will be happy or not
3osvyy2f4zq_30-5-rgb_front do not be intimidated by that
3osvyy2f4zq_31-5-rgb_front they will be the same two stars tonight tomorrow night and the next night as you go out to align your telescope
3osvyy2f4zq_32-5-rgb_front one gentleman said i do not think i can find a couple stars to align to
3osvyy2f4zq_33-5-rgb_front i think that had be difficult maybe i should get a telescope like this
3osvyy2f4zq_34-5-rgb_front well if you can not find two stars you got to find everything with a dobsonian telescope
3osvyy2f4zq_35-5-rgb_front so if you love star hopping if you love the thrill of the hunt perhaps a manual operation telescope is for you
3osvyy2f4zq_36-5-rgb_front if you have got an hour is worth of time if you have got kids if you have got people they want to see a goto setup can certainly be a quick and easier setup
3osvyy2f4zq_37-5-rgb_front because you will track down objects you can see forty fifty objects in an hour if you wanted to with something like this rather than having to track them down manually
3osvyy2f4zq_38-5-rgb_front so keep in mind price point portability where you are going to be viewing from and whether or not like i said you like the thrill of the hunt or you want to be able to go saturn
3osvyy2f4zq_4-5-rgb_front this little guy right here at inch reflector on a dobsonian mount is under two hundred dollars and at that price point probably do not have a better telescope to offer you
3osvyy2f4zq_5-5-rgb_front it does need to be up on a pedestal a little bit maybe a picnic table or something and as a dobsonian it is manual operation
3osvyy2f4zq_6-5-rgb_front more than enough to show you the rings of saturn more than messier or galileo had a great introduction for getting started
3osvyy2f4zq_7-5-rgb_front at the price point it is a real telescope
3osvyy2f4zq_8-5-rgb_front the little guy i got back here is just a little bit more money and again enough to see the rings of saturn enough to get started
3osvyy2f4zq_9-5-rgb_front it is a little ed refractor so it will have good color correction and it will not give you much false color as you push the magnification
3qf2ggfmlf4_1-5-rgb_front what we want to talk about now is the proper execution for our running backs and our quarterback while making the exchange in the pitch play
3qf2ggfmlf4_10-5-rgb_front so there are two different ways we can get to the outside
3qf2ggfmlf4_11-5-rgb_front one is to take the hand off
3qf2ggfmlf4_12-5-rgb_front but right here we used the pitch play
3qf2ggfmlf4_13-5-rgb_front that is when the quarterback will pitch it to our tailback so we can get outside and get up the field
3qf2ggfmlf4_2-5-rgb_front the reason we call it the pitch play is because we use the pitch in order to get our speedy backs to the outside
3qf2ggfmlf4_3-5-rgb_front earlier we used a sweep play which is a hand off
3qf2ggfmlf4_4-5-rgb_front this time we are going to use the pitch to get our man to the outside hopefully to exploit the outside after we have set up the middle
3qf2ggfmlf4_5-5-rgb_front our quarterback will take the snap and this time we are not going to fake to the fullback
3qf2ggfmlf4_6-5-rgb_front the fullback will go out and help with the blocking scheme
3qf2ggfmlf4_7-5-rgb_front our quarterback will then open up wide and make a long pitch to the outside to the running back
3qf2ggfmlf4_8-5-rgb_front our running back wants to make sure he does not go too wide after taking the pitch from the quarterback
3qf2ggfmlf4_9-5-rgb_front then he will look to see where the defense is pinned in or the defense is kicked out and he will get through the opening
3rw6wks5ntu_0-5-rgb_front my name is jared todd and i am going to talk to you a little bit about the selection of the steel and why it is important in the style of knife that you choose
3rw6wks5ntu_1-5-rgb_front your steel that you choose needs to be able to become hard
3rw6wks5ntu_10-5-rgb_front it hardens very well
3rw6wks5ntu_11-5-rgb_front it holds an edge very well and it is very durable
3rw6wks5ntu_12-5-rgb_front there is many different types of steel out there there is stainless steel
3rw6wks5ntu_13-5-rgb_front stainless steel is stainless because it has a lot of chromium in it
3rw6wks5ntu_14-5-rgb_front the chromium that is in the steel part of it is absorbed into the iron molecule itself the other part of the chromium is floating around in basically in solution and that is what causes a steel to become stainless
3rw6wks5ntu_15-5-rgb_front stainless steel does not mean that it is not going to rust it means it is stain less it is going to stain less than a high carbon steel
3rw6wks5ntu_16-5-rgb_front technically stainless steel will not hold as good of an edge as a high carbon steel but in certain applications stainless steel is a must in kitchen knives knives that is going to be used extensively in water salt water
3rw6wks5ntu_17-5-rgb_front and then there are certain types of steels that you can select for those type of applications that will be able to hold a decent edge but they are usually quite expensive
3rw6wks5ntu_18-5-rgb_front where a decent high carbon steel you can get for a couple dollars a pound where a good stainless steel you are going to pay anywhere from fifteen to thirty dollars a pound in selecting the type of steel that you need
3rw6wks5ntu_2-5-rgb_front there is mild steel which is usually ten eighteen which means it only has percent of carbon
3rw6wks5ntu_3-5-rgb_front it does not have enough to get hard when you heat treat it so it will not hold any type of an edge which is most steel that you would find at hardware stores
3rw6wks5ntu_4-5-rgb_front in order to get a good edge and retain that edge you are going to need a knife that has at least half of a percent of carbon up to one percent
3rw6wks5ntu_5-5-rgb_front the steel that i choose to make most of my knives out of is what is called sixty i get it in just a long bar
3rw6wks5ntu_6-5-rgb_front i cut it up to the length that i need
3rw6wks5ntu_7-5-rgb_front it has of a percent of carbon along with other type of alloying elements in it to be able to harden deeper
3rw6wks5ntu_8-5-rgb_front it is a very shock resistant steel
3rw6wks5ntu_9-5-rgb_front it is basically the same type of steel that you have in your car leaf springs
3rmlri5lpt8_0-5-rgb_front now that you know a little bit more about adaptive chairs for canoeing one thing we want to talk about is how to attach the canoe or attach the adaptive chair to your canoe
3rmlri5lpt8_1-5-rgb_front most canoes here have a little bar going across it like so
3rmlri5lpt8_2-5-rgb_front and so what we do is we just take a strap we call it a cam strap and we will run it through the slots of the canoe chair like so
3rmlri5lpt8_3-5-rgb_front and then we will also wrap it back behind the bar a little bit also
3rmlri5lpt8_4-5-rgb_front that way the canoe or the chair will not be sliding around and the participant will stay in place
3rmlri5lpt8_5-5-rgb_front one thing to keep in mind when setting the system up is you want it before you fasten down the chair as tight as possible you want to try to get it centered in the canoe as much as possible
3rmlri5lpt8_6-5-rgb_front one caution about canoeing is a canoe you can tell it is pretty narrow and so there is not a very big bottom surface area
3rmlri5lpt8_7-5-rgb_front and so if the weight is off by a little bit your canoe will start leaning a lot and it just creates sort of a more dangerous situation
3rmlri5lpt8_8-5-rgb_front so before you tighten your canoe in place or your chair in place make sure it is centered as much as possible
3tmjbhsx3zy_0-5-rgb_front hello i am kyle brayer and you are next abdominal work out is the scissor kick
3tmjbhsx3zy_1-5-rgb_front the scissor kick is performed on a mat
3tmjbhsx3zy_10-5-rgb_front that is a scissor kick
3tmjbhsx3zy_11-5-rgb_front so here she is pointing her toes
3tmjbhsx3zy_12-5-rgb_front a variation is for her to flex her foot so she is going to pull her toe back toward her knee
3tmjbhsx3zy_13-5-rgb_front this is going to add a little more pull on the lower abdominal region
3tmjbhsx3zy_14-5-rgb_front ok and stop and down
3tmjbhsx3zy_15-5-rgb_front and notice when kerry performs this exercise that her shoulders her hips and her arms stay perfectly still
3tmjbhsx3zy_16-5-rgb_front she is breathing in through her nose and our through her mouth for the duration of the exercise
3tmjbhsx3zy_17-5-rgb_front and this really isolates the bottoms portion of the abs
3tmjbhsx3zy_18-5-rgb_front so one more time kerry
3tmjbhsx3zy_19-5-rgb_front the legs come up and then she alternates up and down
3tmjbhsx3zy_2-5-rgb_front you can do it at home or in the gym
3tmjbhsx3zy_20-5-rgb_front and relax
3tmjbhsx3zy_21-5-rgb_front and that exercise is the scissor kick
3tmjbhsx3zy_3-5-rgb_front kerry is going to lay back for us on to her back
3tmjbhsx3zy_4-5-rgb_front she is going to slide her hands palm down under her glutes
3tmjbhsx3zy_5-5-rgb_front this is her starting position
3tmjbhsx3zy_6-5-rgb_front she will stick her legs straight out and she is going to try to stay in line from her hips all the way up to her neck is going to stay flat
3tmjbhsx3zy_7-5-rgb_front she is going to try not to move her neck left or right and she is going to try and lock her upper torso
3tmjbhsx3zy_8-5-rgb_front from here she is going to lift her feet off the ground about three inches and that will be her next starting position
3tmjbhsx3zy_9-5-rgb_front and she is just going to alternate legs up and down
3tyfxl2wo-m_0-8-rgb_front hi
3tyfxl2wo-m_10-8-rgb_front hairspray you usually find in your light hold medium hold and your heavy
3tyfxl2wo-m_11-8-rgb_front if you were spraying your hair before you do the braid i definitely recommend using a light hold hairspray
3tyfxl2wo-m_12-8-rgb_front anything too heavy is going to set your style before you have your style in
3tyfxl2wo-m_13-8-rgb_front you want your hair to pliable
3tyfxl2wo-m_14-8-rgb_front you want to be able to move it
3tyfxl2wo-m_15-8-rgb_front you want to be able to create that smoothness and do everything you need to but you want to make it easier on yourself
3tyfxl2wo-m_16-8-rgb_front braiding can be a little bit harder with hand coordination because of the movements of the hair
3tyfxl2wo-m_17-8-rgb_front you only have hands and at times you are holding more than sections of hair
3tyfxl2wo-m_18-8-rgb_front you do want your hair to still remain soft and pliable so that way you are not harming what you have already done
3tyfxl2wo-m_19-8-rgb_front it is not going to make it harder for you to actually use
3tyfxl2wo-m_2-8-rgb_front there are basic products that you are going to need in order to engage in braiding your hair
3tyfxl2wo-m_3-8-rgb_front one of them would probably be pomade or a mud
3tyfxl2wo-m_4-8-rgb_front depending on the coarseness of your hair and the thickness of your hair you are going to want to intrude something that is a little heavier
3tyfxl2wo-m_5-8-rgb_front fiber based products are a little bit on the heavier side
3tyfxl2wo-m_6-8-rgb_front ashley has rather fine hair so i am going to use something that is a little bit more lightweight just in order to give myself a little bit more manageability with her hair
3tyfxl2wo-m_7-8-rgb_front you see how it just kind of tames the frizz and it just kind of smooths her hair down
3tyfxl2wo-m_8-8-rgb_front that way when i actually am braiding her hair will fall a little flatter and it will be easier to work with and more manageable
3tyfxl2wo-m_9-8-rgb_front another product that you are going to need is some sort of hairspray
3urgonjbeki_0-8-rgb_front the next step is called a v step
3urgonjbeki_1-8-rgb_front if you remember i said a lot of the steps in step have their own lingo
3urgonjbeki_10-8-rgb_front if i tap down and switch that would be an alternating lead step of a v step
3urgonjbeki_11-8-rgb_front it starts to again increase my intensity because i am starting to use the space around the bench or wider of the bench
3urgonjbeki_12-8-rgb_front then we will start to move around the bench as well
3urgonjbeki_13-8-rgb_front heels all the way up
3urgonjbeki_14-8-rgb_front you might hear it called an out out in in with this sort of arm movement
3urgonjbeki_15-8-rgb_front it is a front approach
3urgonjbeki_16-8-rgb_front it is a basic step but we lengthened the range of motion to increase the intensity
3urgonjbeki_2-8-rgb_front they also translate to what letters look like on the floor
3urgonjbeki_3-8-rgb_front we have the basics step
3urgonjbeki_4-8-rgb_front now we are going to lengthen that step make it more intense by just taking our legs out a little bit wider to the edges of the bench
3urgonjbeki_5-8-rgb_front it is still a count move but it is called a v step
3urgonjbeki_6-8-rgb_front if you can see i am tracing a v on the floor
3urgonjbeki_7-8-rgb_front from your perspective again
3urgonjbeki_8-8-rgb_front we started with the basic step
3urgonjbeki_9-8-rgb_front now we are just going to take it wider so we have v step
3uwehiuwmry_0-8-rgb_front oh oh hey how is it going
3uwehiuwmry_1-8-rgb_front guess i should be teaching you something since this is an expert show right
3uwehiuwmry_10-8-rgb_front then we are going to need two water cups alright
3uwehiuwmry_11-8-rgb_front after the water cups we are going to need two balls
3uwehiuwmry_12-8-rgb_front the reason for the water cups is that we are going to have to clean off these balls throughout the game because these are going to be going all over the table they are going to be going into beer they are going to be going all over the ground and stuff
3uwehiuwmry_13-8-rgb_front the water is actually to clean off the beer pong balls okay
3uwehiuwmry_14-8-rgb_front then each team has ten cups okay
3uwehiuwmry_15-8-rgb_front now these ten cups you are going to need to fill with beer
3uwehiuwmry_16-8-rgb_front so you got your beer you got your cups you got your water cups you got your balls now all you need is something to play on
3uwehiuwmry_17-8-rgb_front what i have here is a professional style table alright
3uwehiuwmry_18-8-rgb_front now what i have done here is made an expert beer pong table
3uwehiuwmry_19-8-rgb_front this is up to expert qualifications in building a beer pong table
3uwehiuwmry_2-8-rgb_front well beer pong beer pong
3uwehiuwmry_20-8-rgb_front now in the world series of beer pong they play with a lot smaller tables but in my house we play with this big monster one
3uwehiuwmry_21-8-rgb_front it makes it a little bit harder and a little more competitive and the fun thing about this is that you can build your own beer pong table and have people sign all over it so it is always fun to look back and read what people have written and how many times you have one
3uwehiuwmry_22-8-rgb_front we have got tally is of everything so these are the supplies you are going to need so maybe another supply would be a marker for your beer pong table
3uwehiuwmry_23-8-rgb_front those are the supplies that you need so let is move on to the next step
3uwehiuwmry_3-8-rgb_front right let me tell you the supplies needed in beer pong
3uwehiuwmry_4-8-rgb_front to start out you need beer so we got it right here and you know what no true expert beer pong player does not have his very own kegirator at hand
3uwehiuwmry_5-8-rgb_front so i got my draft beer
3uwehiuwmry_6-8-rgb_front let me show you the other supplies that we need alright
3uwehiuwmry_7-8-rgb_front okay so we got our beer alright
3uwehiuwmry_8-8-rgb_front now we are going to need our four cups of beer
3uwehiuwmry_9-8-rgb_front each team gets two cups of beer
3wakk4jqrxw_0-5-rgb_front bryan billhimer in this next step we are going to talk about
3wakk4jqrxw_1-5-rgb_front we are going to pluck the fret and we are going to pull our finger off to the fret
3wakk4jqrxw_10-5-rgb_front and that is a pull off
3wakk4jqrxw_11-5-rgb_front in a riff it might be something like and that is a pull off
3wakk4jqrxw_2-5-rgb_front so this requires two fingers
3wakk4jqrxw_3-5-rgb_front you are going to have your finger on the fret and you got another finger on the fret and you are going to pluck the fret you are going to pull that finger off to the fret
3wakk4jqrxw_4-5-rgb_front so let is see what a pull off looks like on guitar
3wakk4jqrxw_5-5-rgb_front so our tab told us fret on the b string so i am going to use my third finger
3wakk4jqrxw_6-5-rgb_front i am going to fret the fret and i know that i am going to be pulling off to the fret so i am going to go ahead and fret the fret with my first finger
3wakk4jqrxw_7-5-rgb_front so it is going to look like that
3wakk4jqrxw_8-5-rgb_front i am going to pick and i am going to pull off in kind of a down and up at the same time motion with my third finger kinda down and up
3wakk4jqrxw_9-5-rgb_front then i am going to pull off so we are going to hear the note that is being fret above the fret
3wra8v-xdlg_0-5-rgb_front this idea for a vest style is a fitted half vest
3wra8v-xdlg_0-8-rgb_front this idea for a vest style is a fitted half vest
3wra8v-xdlg_1-5-rgb_front what makes it a fitted vest obviously is that it is billowy just kidding ha caught you were you paying attention
3wra8v-xdlg_1-8-rgb_front what makes it a fitted vest obviously is that it is billowy just kidding ha caught you were you paying attention
3wra8v-xdlg_2-5-rgb_front what makes it a fitted vest is that it is fitted to the body what makes it a half vest is that literally half of it is not there it only shows half of the body meaning the top half it hits right below the ribs and it is going to be the same on both sides and that is why i save myself and you i save myself time in drawing and i save you time in watching me repeat myself because drawing only half of it lets you know that the other half is the same and no matter how your croakie is facing you can draw half of it and if you just draw half of it it tells your viewer whoever is looking that the other half is the same
3wra8v-xdlg_2-8-rgb_front what makes it a fitted vest is that it is fitted to the body what makes it a half vest is that literally half of it is not there it only shows half of the body meaning the top half it hits right below the ribs and it is going to be the same on both sides and that is why i save myself and you i save myself time in drawing and i save you time in watching me repeat myself because drawing only half of it lets you know that the other half is the same and no matter how your croakie is facing you can draw half of it and if you just draw half of it it tells your viewer whoever is looking that the other half is the same
3wra8v-xdlg_3-5-rgb_front otherwise why would you only stop at one side what is the point of that
3wra8v-xdlg_3-8-rgb_front otherwise why would you only stop at one side what is the point of that
3wra8v-xdlg_4-5-rgb_front if you are going to have it be an asymmetric vest which i do not even know how you could have that but if you can find a way do it make that your thing
3wra8v-xdlg_4-8-rgb_front if you are going to have it be an asymmetric vest which i do not even know how you could have that but if you can find a way do it make that your thing
3wra8v-xdlg_5-5-rgb_front a vest is pretty much literally means that it is going to be the same on both sides so that is why i drew it like this it is easier to follow
3wra8v-xdlg_5-8-rgb_front a vest is pretty much literally means that it is going to be the same on both sides so that is why i drew it like this it is easier to follow
3xag4y3jqho_0-5-rgb_front when we need to do root canal we need to go into the chamber of the tooth
3xag4y3jqho_0-8-rgb_front when we need to do root canal we need to go into the chamber of the tooth
3xag4y3jqho_1-5-rgb_front the chamber basically previously consists of the blood supply and also of the nerve tissue
3xag4y3jqho_1-8-rgb_front the chamber basically previously consists of the blood supply and also of the nerve tissue
3xag4y3jqho_2-5-rgb_front they are all situated on the inner part of the tooth and so what we have to do for the most part when you get a cavity the cavity is on the top surface or from the side it breaks through the enamel and into part of the tooth structure and then basically exposing these inner part nerve tissue and the blood supply
3xag4y3jqho_2-8-rgb_front they are all situated on the inner part of the tooth and so what we have to do for the most part when you get a cavity the cavity is on the top surface or from the side it breaks through the enamel and into part of the tooth structure and then basically exposing these inner part nerve tissue and the blood supply
3xag4y3jqho_3-5-rgb_front so what we have to do is eliminate those cavities so when we do the drilling for the most part we go on the top exposing this area and cleaning out the chamber from the top portion of the tooth
3xag4y3jqho_3-8-rgb_front so what we have to do is eliminate those cavities so when we do the drilling for the most part we go on the top exposing this area and cleaning out the chamber from the top portion of the tooth
3xag4y3jqho_4-5-rgb_front once that is all done this area is sealed with a material and in doing so the bacteria from outside cannot go in and from the top cannot go back out
3xag4y3jqho_4-8-rgb_front once that is all done this area is sealed with a material and in doing so the bacteria from outside cannot go in and from the top cannot go back out
3xag4y3jqho_5-5-rgb_front so then that tooth is protected and once its protected that tooth should be able to function back like a normal tooth
3xag4y3jqho_5-8-rgb_front so then that tooth is protected and once its protected that tooth should be able to function back like a normal tooth
3xtnvxsmyfu_0-3-rgb_front in this clip we will talk about your first consultation with a plastic surgeon for breast reduction
3xtnvxsmyfu_1-3-rgb_front when you come in to see the plastic surgeon it will be very important that you give all of your health history
3xtnvxsmyfu_10-3-rgb_front do the two breasts match up or not
3xtnvxsmyfu_11-3-rgb_front in fact most women do not have symmetric breasts
3xtnvxsmyfu_12-3-rgb_front and most humans do not have two symmetric breasts
3xtnvxsmyfu_13-3-rgb_front so this is a very common finding
3xtnvxsmyfu_14-3-rgb_front and it is important for the person or patient to understand and the surgeon to understand as far as planning and results
3xtnvxsmyfu_2-3-rgb_front and then the surgeon will perform a thorough physical examination and have a discussion with you about his findings and his recommendations for your breast reduction surgery
3xtnvxsmyfu_3-3-rgb_front during the examination he will examine your breasts by palpation feeling the breast to make sure that there are no abnormalities
3xtnvxsmyfu_4-3-rgb_front no problems with the skin no problems with the nipples no problems with abnormal lumps or bumps or infections
3xtnvxsmyfu_5-3-rgb_front that the breasts have an appearance that would justify breast reduction
3xtnvxsmyfu_6-3-rgb_front meaning overly large for the body
3xtnvxsmyfu_7-3-rgb_front usually in the very very full c d or higher cup range that they would be projecting below the fold of the breast
3xtnvxsmyfu_8-3-rgb_front so therefore warranting the reduction
3xtnvxsmyfu_9-3-rgb_front and then checking for such things as the symmetry of the breasts
3yeunpfsn_q_0-3-rgb_front so we are going to take our arm balance where the knees are over the shoulders lazy tortoise lazy firefly and then straight leg firefly
3yeunpfsn_q_1-3-rgb_front so in order to help get the knees really over the backs of the shoulders in a powerful way we do standing firefly
3yeunpfsn_q_10-3-rgb_front that is even better but i may have to wait for another lifetime for that one
3yeunpfsn_q_11-3-rgb_front i am not sure
3yeunpfsn_q_12-3-rgb_front so then look how i am getting my feet right on top of my hands
3yeunpfsn_q_13-3-rgb_front i am going to sit back
3yeunpfsn_q_14-3-rgb_front at first i am going to do a lazy firefly which i have to say i really prefer because it is a little lazy
3yeunpfsn_q_15-3-rgb_front bend the legs
3yeunpfsn_q_16-3-rgb_front pull with the feet
3yeunpfsn_q_17-3-rgb_front then big firefly straighten the legs
3yeunpfsn_q_18-3-rgb_front then we get to take a little rest and sit down
3yeunpfsn_q_19-3-rgb_front and the arms are really deep underneath legs so it is very convenient this transition into a nice tortoise
3yeunpfsn_q_2-3-rgb_front in standing firefly we come forward
3yeunpfsn_q_20-3-rgb_front well you push down with the legs elongate the legs
3yeunpfsn_q_21-3-rgb_front reach out to the arms the spine everything
3yeunpfsn_q_22-3-rgb_front and yet you can also take a little nap and be sleeping tortoise
3yeunpfsn_q_3-3-rgb_front this little series of poses well it gets you in touch with the absurdity of poses in general funny little shapes that we make
3yeunpfsn_q_4-3-rgb_front but we pull through and you can get that strap
3yeunpfsn_q_5-3-rgb_front that is why it is there
3yeunpfsn_q_6-3-rgb_front that is why i have got a strap around my waist
3yeunpfsn_q_7-3-rgb_front and pull through and get the strap
3yeunpfsn_q_8-3-rgb_front and then you can get your shoulders a little further back and just pull yourself through a little bit
3yeunpfsn_q_9-3-rgb_front of course if you do not need the strap you can just hold your hands together
3yjflbbybx4_0-1-rgb_front okay now i would like to talk to you about decaffeinated teas
3yjflbbybx4_1-1-rgb_front if you buy decaffeinated tea at the store more than likely they put it through some sort of chemical process to remove the caffeine from the dry tea leaves
3yjflbbybx4_10-1-rgb_front and then i will wait thirty seconds
3yjflbbybx4_11-1-rgb_front so after thirty seconds to a minute has passed the caffeine has been released into the tea that is steeping in your cup
3yjflbbybx4_12-1-rgb_front and so what you will do then is pull the diffuser out of your tea and discard the water or the tea that is steeping in your cup
3yjflbbybx4_13-1-rgb_front if you are using a teapot you will just pour out all the water
3yjflbbybx4_14-1-rgb_front and then reinsert your diffuser add fresh water to the pot and then steep for your desired steeping time depending on what kind of tea you are making
3yjflbbybx4_15-1-rgb_front and the tea in that cup will be at the end of that time will be caffeine free
3yjflbbybx4_2-1-rgb_front you do not want extra chemicals in your tea
3yjflbbybx4_3-1-rgb_front so i am here to tell you a way that you can enjoy every variety of tea there is three thousand of them decaffeinated
3yjflbbybx4_4-1-rgb_front so you are ready for bed and you want a nice warm soothing cup of tea but you do not want the stimulation of caffeine
3yjflbbybx4_5-1-rgb_front you could drink an african red tea because it has no caffeine or a tsane an herbal infusion that has no caffeine but if you are looking to enjoy a green black or white tea that does have caffeine in it naturally you are going to want to remove the caffeine
3yjflbbybx4_6-1-rgb_front and i am going to show you a simple way to do that
3yjflbbybx4_7-1-rgb_front the fact is when you are steeping tea or brewing tea the caffeine is released into the water in the first thirty seconds to a minute of steeping
3yjflbbybx4_8-1-rgb_front so what i will do say i want to enjoy a black tea with milk before bedtime
3yjflbbybx4_9-1-rgb_front i will put my black tea in my infuser or teapot and add hot water just like i am going to steep my cup of tea bing water for black teas of course
3zd-g_u97rm_0-8-rgb_front ok now we are at the stage where now in the process of making the wine this bucket here has been digesting the fruit for seven days the yeast has been devouring the sugar and uh also the sugar and fruit too breaking it down making it soft and uh and ready to uh to further move on through the wine process
3zd-g_u97rm_1-8-rgb_front now at this point i would like to use a strainer like this and dip it into the wine
3zd-g_u97rm_2-8-rgb_front and we would have the fruit in here and dump the fruit in here and at that point the juice from the wine is all dripping through and i am using a cloth here that s an organic cloth
3zd-g_u97rm_3-8-rgb_front once you got the fruit in there you would gather this up like this with the fruit in it and you would start twisting this and the fruit would start juicing out juicing out all the great juices through the colander and into the pot down here
3zd-g_u97rm_4-8-rgb_front you would keep on doing this until you have yourself a full pot of the prepared wine
3zd-g_u97rm_5-8-rgb_front you would keep pulling it out until you finally got through all the fruit and eventually you would pour all the juice in here filtering it out all the fruit debris so all you would end up with is the juice of the fruit
4-jt6c_akpc_0-5-rgb_front hi
4-jt6c_akpc_10-5-rgb_front again do not worry if it is not the desired consistency
4-jt6c_akpc_11-5-rgb_front cause what i will do with that is again do our same chopping motion
4-jt6c_akpc_12-5-rgb_front chop all this onion down fine
4-jt6c_akpc_13-5-rgb_front alright just when you take your onions to the side make sure you do not put them in your bowl
4-jt6c_akpc_14-5-rgb_front keep them off to the side cause we are actually going to saute our onion
4-jt6c_akpc_15-5-rgb_front and we are going to chop now our green scallion
4-jt6c_akpc_16-5-rgb_front and we are going to add that with our onion and we are going to actually simmer simmer saute both of them together
4-jt6c_akpc_17-5-rgb_front so make sure you keep them on the side and do not put them in your bowl
4-jt6c_akpc_2-5-rgb_front alright we are just going to chop up one small onion to add to this dish
4-jt6c_akpc_3-5-rgb_front alright we are just going to cut off both sides of our small onion like so
4-jt6c_akpc_4-5-rgb_front and want to just score the onion and pull away the outer shell and begin to chop it up
4-jt6c_akpc_5-5-rgb_front alright what i like to do is just cut the onion in half put the flat sides down
4-jt6c_akpc_6-5-rgb_front slice the onion going with the lines of the onion one way
4-jt6c_akpc_7-5-rgb_front straight down

4-iaiev2hsk_1-3-rgb_front i am going to show you how to create fun christmas party games with the things that you have already to use wrap your presents and get ready for christmas
4-iaiev2hsk_10-3-rgb_front and you remove one chair and you have one player winner
4-iaiev2hsk_2-3-rgb_front another game that you can play at your christmas party that requires nothing more then the things that you already have for christmas is christmas musical chairs
4-iaiev2hsk_3-3-rgb_front all you have to do is get your cd of your favorite christmas music and a cd player of course
4-iaiev2hsk_4-3-rgb_front you want to have as many chairs as you have guest
4-iaiev2hsk_5-3-rgb_front take one chair away so you would have guest you would want chairs
4-iaiev2hsk_6-3-rgb_front sometime similar to this is a good chair idea
4-iaiev2hsk_7-3-rgb_front you want something sturdy not to heavy you do not want anyone to hurt themselves while running around in a circle
4-iaiev2hsk_8-3-rgb_front while the music plays you stand up walk around the chairs
4-iaiev2hsk_9-3-rgb_front when the music shuts off then you grab a sit and whoever is left out of the circle is out for that round and you remove another chair and it goes until you have players left
40vtkeryvfe_0-1-rgb_front hi this is liz muller from liz is hair design in hollywood florida
40vtkeryvfe_1-1-rgb_front in this clip we are going to show you how to care for african american hair and hair
40vtkeryvfe_10-1-rgb_front this is liz muller and this is how to care for african american and hair
40vtkeryvfe_2-1-rgb_front this is an example of relaxed hair african american hair
40vtkeryvfe_3-1-rgb_front and this young lady here she actually treats her hair once a week
40vtkeryvfe_4-1-rgb_front she keeps it real moisturized gets her hair washed and set once a week and it is really important to do these things because you want to keep the hair in good condition
40vtkeryvfe_5-1-rgb_front it is very fragile when you get your hair relaxed and you want to just treat it all the time and if it is not relaxed too you know because maybe it does not it does not have a relaxer it is courser so you want to really add a lot of moisture to that hair because ethnic hair tends to get dry and you want to keep it conditioned to work better with it
40vtkeryvfe_6-1-rgb_front actually i use this beautiful moroccan oil and it is really wonderful on the hair
40vtkeryvfe_7-1-rgb_front it adds conditioning to the hair and it leaves the hair in wonderful condition to work with
40vtkeryvfe_8-1-rgb_front i do it and i use it when i roll and set the hair put a little bit in there just about a dimes worth and i rub it all over
40vtkeryvfe_9-1-rgb_front on mine i do the same thing and that is hair
40dte31p5ua_0-5-rgb_front ian loveall hi
40dte31p5ua_10-5-rgb_front and then of course the blockage created by the object will create a cast shadow against the wall which we see here
40dte31p5ua_11-5-rgb_front some of that light however will bounce back from this wall onto the object and that creates our reflected light
40dte31p5ua_12-5-rgb_front if you see here along the edge there is just a little bit of light from this wall that is being bounced back at the urn
40dte31p5ua_2-5-rgb_front now here is another example of lighting
40dte31p5ua_3-5-rgb_front lighting is what is going to create the illusion that you are looking at something that is not actually there
40dte31p5ua_4-5-rgb_front for example this alcove we see the key elements of light and shadow
40dte31p5ua_5-5-rgb_front you have your high light your low light your core shadow your cast shadow and your reflected light
40dte31p5ua_6-5-rgb_front so what we are looking at here is a basic setup of the basic elements of light and shadow as we have our high light our low light core shadow cast shadow and reflected light
40dte31p5ua_7-5-rgb_front now the high light is an area on an object that is receiving a direct blow from the light source which is behind me here the window and that would be this edge of the urn right here
40dte31p5ua_8-5-rgb_front the low light is an area of the object that is not quite in direct light but it is still receiving some light and that would be this middle section here
40dte31p5ua_9-5-rgb_front and then as this urn curves away from the light source we are going to get our core shadow which is the darkest point on the object that is receiving the least amount of light
414pas3sdu0_0-5-rgb_front the ingredients you need to make sugar skulls are obviously sugar and i wanted to talk about the kind of sugar you want to use
414pas3sdu0_1-5-rgb_front you also need something called meringue powder that you can get at bakery stores
414pas3sdu0_10-5-rgb_front i bought extra fine grain granulated sugar because if you use an extra fine grain it gives a lot more detail to your sugar skulls once you have molded them out
414pas3sdu0_11_12-5-rgb_front if you use a courser grain you can still use it but it looks a little bit coarser it is up to you
414pas3sdu0_13-5-rgb_front i prefer a little bit more detail around the eyes and the teeth of my mold
414pas3sdu0_14-5-rgb_front you see these molds have some fairly fine details in them
414pas3sdu0_15-5-rgb_front so i like using a fine grained sugar
414pas3sdu0_16-5-rgb_front this is an extra fine sugar that is just my preference
414pas3sdu0_17-5-rgb_front meringue powder and water
414pas3sdu0_18-5-rgb_front those are the ingredients you need
414pas3sdu0_2-5-rgb_front it comes in a couple of different ways
414pas3sdu0_3-5-rgb_front you can get it in a plastic container like this or sometimes you can get a big bag of it like this it is the same thing
414pas3sdu0_4-5-rgb_front sometimes it comes in a little jar or kind of a little plastic jar
414pas3sdu0_5-5-rgb_front basically all it is is dried egg white mixed with powdered sugar but it is used as a binding agent for the sugar skulls so that they stay together
414pas3sdu0_6-5-rgb_front granulated sugar meringue powder and water are the ingredients you need to make the basic composition of the sugar skulls
414pas3sdu0_7-5-rgb_front a little bit about granulated sugar
414pas3sdu0_8-5-rgb_front you can get granulated sugar in a lot of different grain sizes and sometimes if you just go get generic granulated sugar it does not really say anything about the size of the grains
414pas3sdu0_9-5-rgb_front so sometimes that sugar can be kind of course
41uzlhdmroa_0-3-rgb_front in the field with a pair of binoculars never use your shirt tail to clean them
41uzlhdmroa_1-3-rgb_front always carry a microfiber cloth that is made to clean glass it will not scratch your lenses
41uzlhdmroa_2-3-rgb_front when you have a bird you want to look at there are two basic methods of using your binocular
41uzlhdmroa_3-3-rgb_front one is the map method
41uzlhdmroa_4-3-rgb_front you find the telephone pole raise it up to the wire and move across the wire and there is the bird hopefully he has not flown
41uzlhdmroa_5-3-rgb_front the one that most birders use i call the zin method
41uzlhdmroa_6-3-rgb_front where i have got my body perpendicular to a line where the bird is i look at the bird
41uzlhdmroa_7-3-rgb_front i do not move anything but my hands and my binocular and there is the bird right in place
41uzlhdmroa_8-3-rgb_front that takes about five minutes of practice and then you will be able to do it for a lifetime
42c5l12rhwo_0-5-rgb_front what is coming in older toilets years old and older is lime will buildup in the jet way around the toilet
42c5l12rhwo_0-8-rgb_front what is coming in older toilets years old and older is lime will buildup in the jet way around the toilet
42c5l12rhwo_1-5-rgb_front when the water goes through the flush valve and comes out to the rim these jets will get clogged with calcium
42c5l12rhwo_1-8-rgb_front when the water goes through the flush valve and comes out to the rim these jets will get clogged with calcium
42c5l12rhwo_10-5-rgb_front but i will tell you for five dollars a quart it s much better to save an old toilet and the rim than it is to throw the toilet away
42c5l12rhwo_10-8-rgb_front but i will tell you for five dollars a quart it s much better to save an old toilet and the rim than it is to throw the toilet away
42c5l12rhwo_11-5-rgb_front we will take this toilet and we are going to let it sit for minutes and then we are going to flush it and we will see how our results are and that should fix the toilet
42c5l12rhwo_11-8-rgb_front we will take this toilet and we are going to let it sit for minutes and then we are going to flush it and we will see how our results are and that should fix the toilet
42c5l12rhwo_2-5-rgb_front i am not a proponent of cleaning them with a wire
42c5l12rhwo_2-8-rgb_front i am not a proponent of cleaning them with a wire
42c5l12rhwo_3-5-rgb_front i am a proponent of using toilet bowl
42c5l12rhwo_3-8-rgb_front i am a proponent of using toilet bowl
42c5l12rhwo_4-5-rgb_front it s an acid solution and what we do we take and we pour this whole quart in to the overflow tube all at once
42c5l12rhwo_4-8-rgb_front it s an acid solution and what we do we take and we pour this whole quart in to the overflow tube all at once
42c5l12rhwo_5-5-rgb_front when it goes into the overflow tube you will then notice the whole quart
42c5l12rhwo_5-8-rgb_front when it goes into the overflow tube you will then notice the whole quart
42c5l12rhwo_6-5-rgb_front you will then notice that the acid is coming out of the rim of the toilet
42c5l12rhwo_6-8-rgb_front you will then notice that the acid is coming out of the rim of the toilet
42c5l12rhwo_7-5-rgb_front as it comes out it is taking the lime in the jets with it
42c5l12rhwo_7-8-rgb_front as it comes out it is taking the lime in the jets with it
42c5l12rhwo_8-5-rgb_front now most toilets this will work fine one quart will save them
42c5l12rhwo_8-8-rgb_front now most toilets this will work fine one quart will save them
42c5l12rhwo_9-5-rgb_front occasionally i will need two quarts and rarely i will need three
42c5l12rhwo_9-8-rgb_front occasionally i will need two quarts and rarely i will need three
43zfrz1zh2w_1-8-rgb_front now we are going to talk about fish and if you lose one
43zfrz1zh2w_10-8-rgb_front what i want to do is look in the front of the tank and see if i can not find the fish that has passed away
43zfrz1zh2w_11-8-rgb_front for locating him in the tank i am going to use my net to find the fish scoop him out and remove him out of the tank
43zfrz1zh2w_12-8-rgb_front once you remove the dead fish which we have in the tank out of the fish tank properly dispose of it in the commode
43zfrz1zh2w_13-8-rgb_front so if you send the fish out to big water blue open sea where it can break down naturally
43zfrz1zh2w_14-8-rgb_front once you do this your tank is happy and healthy
43zfrz1zh2w_15-8-rgb_front and on an ending note if taking care of your tank make sure you look at your fish tank everyday not only when you are feeding your fish but just to makes sure that you have not lost any
43zfrz1zh2w_16-8-rgb_front if you have any fish that are being too aggressive that you remove him from the tank so that they are not picking everybody else and pushing everybody up into one corner
43zfrz1zh2w_17-8-rgb_front sometimes this happens even on fish that are listed as a community fish
43zfrz1zh2w_18-8-rgb_front sometimes they can get a little feisty and like to pick on other people in the tank
43zfrz1zh2w_19-8-rgb_front just like us fish have personalities just like we do
43zfrz1zh2w_2-8-rgb_front unfortunately as i was doing a water change on my tank i noticed one of my gold dust mollies has passed away
43zfrz1zh2w_20-8-rgb_front when you are a professionally person such as myself and if you do not mind touching a dead fish body you can just put your hand in the tank remove the dead fish and put it in a commode
43zfrz1zh2w_21-8-rgb_front just make sure you wash your hands thoroughly
43zfrz1zh2w_22-8-rgb_front another suggestion is we have oscar fish which can get up to two feet in length please do not put this on your commode
43zfrz1zh2w_23-8-rgb_front a two foot fish which is two feet long approximately a foot high and at two inches thick is not going to fit down a commode properly
43zfrz1zh2w_24-8-rgb_front so please put this big fish in a trash bag seal the trash bag and put it in the trash can for proper disposable
43zfrz1zh2w_25-8-rgb_front there again do not put the big fish in a commode
43zfrz1zh2w_26-8-rgb_front let alone a three foot algae eater cause it is just not going to fit
43zfrz1zh2w_27-8-rgb_front thanks again for coming to my house and letting me teach you on how to take care of a fish tank properly
43zfrz1zh2w_3-8-rgb_front when you lose a fish make sure that you remove the fish properly
43zfrz1zh2w_4-8-rgb_front if you do not it can leave an unsightly mess in the tank and the other fish like to scavenge on dead fish
43zfrz1zh2w_5-8-rgb_front of course this is what they do in the wild
43zfrz1zh2w_6-8-rgb_front some people who get lazy such as myself sometimes we always do not remove the fish and the fish take care of it
43zfrz1zh2w_7-8-rgb_front but for your purpose i am going to teach you the proper way to remove a dead fish
43zfrz1zh2w_8-8-rgb_front lift the lid on your tank
43zfrz1zh2w_9-8-rgb_front you are going to use a nice little handy dandy tool which is called a fishnet which you use to remove the dead fish
44qq77fk4ew_0-3-rgb_front hi i am patti german and i am a licensed marriage and family therapist here in new york city
44qq77fk4ew_1-3-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about how to find a marriage counselor
44qq77fk4ew_2-3-rgb_front it is very very daunting to not know who to go to when your relationship is in trouble
44qq77fk4ew_3-3-rgb_front i highly recommend that you go to a website called the american association for marriage and therapists
44qq77fk4ew_4-3-rgb_front and in this website you can find a therapist in your zip code in your area and read through the bios and the qualifications
44qq77fk4ew_5-3-rgb_front i think it is very very important that you work with someone who is trained as a marriage and family therapist
44qq77fk4ew_6-3-rgb_front knowing what a relationship is about and marriage and family therapists are trained to work with more than one person in the room so it is very important that you look up the aamft and find a marriage counselor in your zip code
44qq77fk4ew_7-3-rgb_front again this is patti german in new york city
45xyg7z7cdq_1-5-rgb_front today we are talking about how to choose a winter horse blanket
45xyg7z7cdq_10-5-rgb_front you can through them in your washer on cold water with mild detergent
45xyg7z7cdq_11-5-rgb_front but make sure that you read the label and instructions that come along with your blanket so that you do not ruin the waterproof barrier of the blanket
45xyg7z7cdq_12-5-rgb_front so take that in to consideration how easy is this blanket going to be to wash after my horse has worn it for three or four months out in the snow the manure the rain and the mud
45xyg7z7cdq_13-5-rgb_front think about can i just throw it in my washer or can i hose it off will it clean up easily for the next season
45xyg7z7cdq_2-5-rgb_front we have kind of gone through all the steps that you are going to use in purchasing your horse blanket and now you need to know what you are going to do with your horse blanket now that your horse has been wearing it for a while
45xyg7z7cdq_3-5-rgb_front you know most horses will be horses and they are going to get it dirty
45xyg7z7cdq_4-5-rgb_front they are going to roll in the mud
45xyg7z7cdq_5-5-rgb_front they are going to roll in the snow and the rain
45xyg7z7cdq_6-5-rgb_front they are probably going to lie down and roll in their own manure which happens
45xyg7z7cdq_7-5-rgb_front so you want to take this in to consideration when purchasing a winter horse blanket is how easy is it to clean and care for
45xyg7z7cdq_8-5-rgb_front take in mind that some of your canvas blankets like this if you try to machine wash them you will ruin the waterproof barrier that is on the top of the blanket
45xyg7z7cdq_9-5-rgb_front so this one is just going to be need cleaned with a hose and a stiff brush where as some of the turnout and stable blankets are machine washable
46uzccnmgpk_0-3-rgb_front alright the drink we are about to make is alien secretion
46uzccnmgpk_1-3-rgb_front mm sounds good does not it
46uzccnmgpk_10-3-rgb_front but this drink actually tastes fantastic
46uzccnmgpk_11-3-rgb_front you can tell by the ingredients and the smell that it is going to be good
46uzccnmgpk_12-3-rgb_front so grab an alien squeeze out a little bit of alien secretion
46uzccnmgpk_13-3-rgb_front look at that color beautiful
46uzccnmgpk_14-3-rgb_front give it a straw and secrete it in to your mouth
46uzccnmgpk_15-3-rgb_front bottoms up
46uzccnmgpk_2-3-rgb_front here we go
46uzccnmgpk_3-3-rgb_front this is how you make it
46uzccnmgpk_4-3-rgb_front put ice in a glass and do one shot of melon liqueur that green alien color very important ingredient
46uzccnmgpk_5-3-rgb_front and follow that up with a shot of malibu rum
46uzccnmgpk_6-3-rgb_front and finally going to top it off with some pineapple juice
46uzccnmgpk_7-3-rgb_front it will be about a shot of pineapple juice
46uzccnmgpk_8-3-rgb_front and mix this together
46uzccnmgpk_9-3-rgb_front now i know alien secretion does not really sound all that great
46wkiipnjt8_0-8-rgb_front okay so now we have prepared the bat
46wkiipnjt8_1-8-rgb_front we have turned our pot top over and it is time to make sure that this is properly on center so that we can start trimming
46wkiipnjt8_10-8-rgb_front you dried it off again similar way with the towel
46wkiipnjt8_11-8-rgb_front there is no too much water
46wkiipnjt8_12-8-rgb_front now i am going to take some scrap clay here simply take some pieces and take them around the edges of the plant pot
46wkiipnjt8_13-8-rgb_front usually i only need three this is quite a large pot some larger pot require more
46wkiipnjt8_14-8-rgb_front notice how i am not sticking the clay to the plant pot
46wkiipnjt8_15-8-rgb_front i am sticking it to the back
46wkiipnjt8_16-8-rgb_front i am just using one edge of the clay to secure the edge of the plant pot into place
46wkiipnjt8_17-8-rgb_front okay so now we have centered and secured our plant pot
46wkiipnjt8_18-8-rgb_front the next thing is going to be trimming the foot and i will talk about that next
46wkiipnjt8_2-8-rgb_front and the way we are going to do this is with a pin tool and i showed you earlier
46wkiipnjt8_3-8-rgb_front now what i am going to do is turn the plant pot on the wheel and take my pin tool and steady my hands up and let the pin tool touch the pot
46wkiipnjt8_4-8-rgb_front now as you can see the pin tool is making a mark that to there
46wkiipnjt8_5-8-rgb_front now what i do with this mark i face it towards me i put a finger on each side of our mark it is right there and right there and i am simply going to push the pot away from me and then i am going to
46wkiipnjt8_6-8-rgb_front okay so you can see right there the navel is pretty much going making a full circle around the pot
46wkiipnjt8_7-8-rgb_front the more of center the pot will be the smaller your line will be
46wkiipnjt8_8-8-rgb_front so if it is really i will just be touching one little side of it
46wkiipnjt8_9-8-rgb_front so now we have the pot centered on the wheel the next thing is going to be securing it and i just want to get a little bit of moisture on this wheel so that clay will stick
46ambgo7eyy_0-3-rgb_front so we are going to talk about specifically the six movements of the spine today
46ambgo7eyy_1-3-rgb_front the spine is capable of elongating it is capable of moving laterally on each side it is capable of twisting to each side it is capable of a back bend and a forward bend so actually those are really seven movements of the spine
46ambgo7eyy_2-3-rgb_front so we are going to practice all of those today and again why is that important
46ambgo7eyy_3-3-rgb_front it is important to allow the spine to in each direction that it is capable of moving
46ambgo7eyy_4-3-rgb_front also that helps the muscles that surround the spine and the other bones to begin warming up and as i said it lets you know where your edge is
46ambgo7eyy_5-3-rgb_front so the six movements of the spine create a fabulous that you can do any time before your yoga practice actually done by themselves they are a little mini practice too
46ambgo7eyy_6-3-rgb_front so if you do not have a lot of time you could just practice the six movements of the spine all by themselves
46fcertjzcw_0-3-rgb_front hi going to talk a little bit about whitewater raft designs
46fcertjzcw_1-3-rgb_front right here i have a raft which is the most common raft out there used commercially now starting to be a pretty common boat to be used privately as well
46fcertjzcw_2-3-rgb_front this is a twelve and a half foot raft that you can seat is sort of set up to carry between six to eight people has three ports is made of hyperlon has an inflated floor so any water that comes into the boat drains out of the boat through these holes around the perimeter of the floor here
46fcertjzcw_3-3-rgb_front the outside tube and the floor combined displace the weight of the paddlers in the boat so any big waves that come crashing in drain out through the floors
46fcertjzcw_4-3-rgb_front the more holes you have in the perimeter of the floor the quicker the raft will drain
46fcertjzcw_5-3-rgb_front the advantages of rafts are they are more maneuverable in bigger water and you

476vh2-hlv0_0-5-rgb_front hi
476vh2-hlv0_0-8-rgb_front hi
476vh2-hlv0_10-5-rgb_front secondly because it is metal while it is made to use in your microwave it can still cause problems so you want to not use it not leave it in there as much as possible
476vh2-hlv0_10-8-rgb_front secondly because it is metal while it is made to use in your microwave it can still cause problems so you want to not use it not leave it in there as much as possible
476vh2-hlv0_11-5-rgb_front also you want to make sure that when you are cleaning this you are particularly careful about cleaning corners where it is going to be touching the microwave walls
476vh2-hlv0_11-8-rgb_front also you want to make sure that when you are cleaning this you are particularly careful about cleaning corners where it is going to be touching the microwave walls
476vh2-hlv0_12-5-rgb_front all of this will be in your microwave owner is manual
476vh2-hlv0_12-8-rgb_front all of this will be in your microwave owner is manual
476vh2-hlv0_13-5-rgb_front you just want to make sure and get this all nice and clean
476vh2-hlv0_13-8-rgb_front you just want to make sure and get this all nice and clean
476vh2-hlv0_14-5-rgb_front even if you keep this in your microwave most of the time it probably still will not get that dirty unless you have got exploding food all the time
476vh2-hlv0_14-8-rgb_front even if you keep this in your microwave most of the time it probably still will not get that dirty unless you have got exploding food all the time
476vh2-hlv0_15-5-rgb_front this should be one of the easier steps
476vh2-hlv0_15-8-rgb_front this should be one of the easier steps
476vh2-hlv0_16-5-rgb_front we are just going to rinse it off and then put it to the side to dry
476vh2-hlv0_16-8-rgb_front we are just going to rinse it off and then put it to the side to dry
476vh2-hlv0_2-5-rgb_front our next step is going to be cleaning the microwave oven rack
476vh2-hlv0_2-8-rgb_front our next step is going to be cleaning the microwave oven rack
476vh2-hlv0_3-5-rgb_front this is going to be the same process as cleaning the turn table
476vh2-hlv0_3-8-rgb_front this is going to be the same process as cleaning the turn table
476vh2-hlv0_4-5-rgb_front let me get this wet first
476vh2-hlv0_4-8-rgb_front let me get this wet first
476vh2-hlv0_5-5-rgb_front spray that down
476vh2-hlv0_5-8-rgb_front spray that down
476vh2-hlv0_6-5-rgb_front then just use your mild dish soap that you would use for cleaning your dishes and silverware
476vh2-hlv0_6-8-rgb_front then just use your mild dish soap that you would use for cleaning your dishes and silverware
476vh2-hlv0_7-5-rgb_front you are going to wipe this down
476vh2-hlv0_7-8-rgb_front you are going to wipe this down
476vh2-hlv0_8-5-rgb_front as i mentioned earlier in general you should not leave the rack in the microwave
476vh2-hlv0_8-8-rgb_front as i mentioned earlier in general you should not leave the rack in the microwave
476vh2-hlv0_9-5-rgb_front first of all this helps prevent it from getting dirty
476vh2-hlv0_9-8-rgb_front first of all this helps prevent it from getting dirty
477ze29y6eu_1-8-rgb_front now some of the parts that you might add to your winter horse blanket are called hoods and neck covers
477ze29y6eu_10-8-rgb_front this net cover will go right over the top of the head and then the blanket has buckles and the neck cover has straps
477ze29y6eu_11-8-rgb_front so what we are going to do is just need apply the straps to the blanket and secure the neck cover in place
477ze29y6eu_12-8-rgb_front why would your horse need a neck cover
477ze29y6eu_13-8-rgb_front well if he is outside and it rains a lot or snows a lot on him the blanket might be waterproof but the problem is that sometimes it rains or snows on their neck and melts and it can still get down into your blanket
477ze29y6eu_14-8-rgb_front so you might have a waterproof blanket but if you do not have a neck cover it will not keep it from running down their neck into the horses blanket
477ze29y6eu_15-8-rgb_front then it secures with fasteners in the front as well
477ze29y6eu_16-8-rgb_front so that if he starts playing or running around it is pretty secure to the blanket and also in the front
477ze29y6eu_17-8-rgb_front some of the hoods or net covers will have a strap that attaches to a halter so it is got even more strength for moving around
477ze29y6eu_18-8-rgb_front so this net cover is going to keep him pretty much covered from the elements from his neck and it will not allow any of the moisture to get down inside his blanket and run down into or on his chest or inside the blanket
477ze29y6eu_19-8-rgb_front so that is why you would use a net cover to keep their hair coat short or to keep out the elements from inside their blanket
477ze29y6eu_2-8-rgb_front now hoods usually go down over their face so let me show you this
477ze29y6eu_3_4-8-rgb_front this one does not necessarily go with this blanket but will just show you how it works it slides up over the top of their head and then comes down thru their ears and they can see through it there we go so it would fit down over their face
477ze29y6eu_5-8-rgb_front now you would say why do i need a hood for my horse
477ze29y6eu_6-8-rgb_front people that want that show quality shine like a lot halter horses and performance horses show horses they want to keep them in their short hair coats all over their body all winter long so that they can keep showing them and have that summer look to them it shows off their body better
477ze29y6eu_7-8-rgb_front so their going to purchase a hood that covers all their body
477ze29y6eu_8-8-rgb_front it does not do much good if you are showing a horse to have him smooth and shiny up to right here and then his chest and head is hairy cause then you are going to need to body clip that and once you body clip it he is going to be cold there and then you are going to need to apply a hood
477ze29y6eu_9-8-rgb_front now this a net cover
47dghjiozpq_0-5-rgb_front o k
47dghjiozpq_1-5-rgb_front once you have decided where you are going to have it on there
47dghjiozpq_10-5-rgb_front darn it
47dghjiozpq_11-5-rgb_front probably because you forgot to take the paper off
47dghjiozpq_12-5-rgb_front and the brown one it is already ready
47dghjiozpq_13-5-rgb_front so i will go ahead and out them right back where i had them
47dghjiozpq_14-5-rgb_front and just iron them in place
47dghjiozpq_2-5-rgb_front you want to make sure you have the paper off of the back
47dghjiozpq_3-5-rgb_front and it should peel right off
47dghjiozpq_4-5-rgb_front if it is not
47dghjiozpq_5-5-rgb_front if the adhesive is staying on the paper then you need to it
47dghjiozpq_6-5-rgb_front that means you did not iron it long enough
47dghjiozpq_7-5-rgb_front otherwise you will kind of see a frosted look to it
47dghjiozpq_8-5-rgb_front and if you try to iron it with the paper on the back you do not get anywhere
47dghjiozpq_9-5-rgb_front so if you try to iron it and it is not sticking
47hhnulbax0_0-5-rgb_front here i will be talking about a minor seven flat five chord
47hhnulbax0_1-5-rgb_front which is also known as a half diminished chord
47hhnulbax0_10-5-rgb_front now originally in we were talking about triads in part one
47hhnulbax0_11-5-rgb_front a chord with a one flat three and flat five was called diminished
47hhnulbax0_12-5-rgb_front this is called half diminished
47hhnulbax0_13-5-rgb_front because to make it a fully diminished chord you would also have to lower the seven a second time
47hhnulbax0_14-5-rgb_front on the key board this will be one three five seven
47hhnulbax0_15-5-rgb_front we are going to lower the third for minor
47hhnulbax0_16-5-rgb_front the seven for flat seven
47hhnulbax0_17-5-rgb_front or maybe the flat seven to make it a seven chord
47hhnulbax0_18-5-rgb_front and lower the five to make it a flat five or a diminished chord on the bottom with a flat seven on the top
47hhnulbax0_19-5-rgb_front now two ways you could write that out
47hhnulbax0_2-5-rgb_front let is look at the scale and i will show you why
47hhnulbax0_20-5-rgb_front you could write it as a c half diminished seven
47hhnulbax0_21-5-rgb_front or c minor seven flat five
47hhnulbax0_22-5-rgb_front or over here c minor seven flat five
47hhnulbax0_3-5-rgb_front here is the major scale all seven notes
47hhnulbax0_4-5-rgb_front now we are going to first talk about minor seven
47hhnulbax0_5-5-rgb_front which we did in the last clip
47hhnulbax0_6-5-rgb_front which was a lowered third to make it minor and a lowered seven to make it seven
47hhnulbax0_7-5-rgb_front you had a one flat three five flat seven for minor seven
47hhnulbax0_8-5-rgb_front now we are also going to flat the five
47hhnulbax0_9-5-rgb_front so you have one flat three flat five flat seven
47ojor2bc34_0-8-rgb_front my name is anthony maddaloni and i am going to talk about how to become a medical photographer
47ojor2bc34_1-8-rgb_front now a medical photographer is a photographer that documents essentially facts for doctors insurance companies hospitals patient rights advocates and what you are really doing it could be anywhere from taking slides of literally accidents potentially surgeries going on and documenting them properly
47ojor2bc34_10-8-rgb_front you might be using a completely different type of set up
47ojor2bc34_11-8-rgb_front so that is one way
47ojor2bc34_12-8-rgb_front the other thing is to look at a lot of different types of medical photography out there
47ojor2bc34_13-8-rgb_front that could be medical journals websites and see you know is this something that i think i can be good at
47ojor2bc34_14-8-rgb_front can i understand this type of composition
47ojor2bc34_15-8-rgb_front so those are some of the ways that i would become a medical photographer
47ojor2bc34_2-8-rgb_front and it is more of a technical type of photography than photography
47ojor2bc34_3-8-rgb_front and one way you might want to break into this type of photography is to go to a medical school and see what a medical school who they use and assist
47ojor2bc34_4-8-rgb_front like any other type of photography that i talk about really your first little foot in the door is finding someone who does it professionally and spend a day with them and see what it is like because it might not be anything what you think it is like or it might be even better than you think it is and you can find out that you are suited for that type of photography
47ojor2bc34_5-8-rgb_front now medical photography is a type of photography where you are probably going to be using something a digital camera
47ojor2bc34_6-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that you have a digital camera that can make a nice a rather large file because you never know what these
47ojor2bc34_7-8-rgb_front these could be used in a court case they could be used for lectures med school
47ojor2bc34_8-8-rgb_front so you want to make sure you have the right equipment in order to do this type of photography
47ojor2bc34_9-8-rgb_front you would not use cameras that you would say use for photojournalism for medical photography
47ygbj5ydyk_1-5-rgb_front now the triangle is alot of people dont know this but its named after a very popular geometric shape called the triangle and all this is is a steel rod that is been bent twice to form that three sided shape we call the triangle and it is always open on one end because in order for the sound to resonate it is got to be open otherwise you would get a real muted mufilled sound
47ygbj5ydyk_2-5-rgb_front and there is basically three parts to the triangle as an instrument theres the triangle itself there is the holder which what i have is a wooden bead that is been run through with a nylon cord to hold the triangle up
47ygbj5ydyk_3-5-rgb_front and the third part the hammer or the striker or the beater or the metal stick that you hit it with
47ygbj5ydyk_4-5-rgb_front whatever term you want to use for that those are the three parts
47ygbj5ydyk_5-5-rgb_front holding the triangle the triangle itself which is gonna produce the tone and the hammer that helps you with that
484pokla0ug_1-1-rgb_front what we want to talk about right now is the importance of our defensive backs and coming up to stop the run play
484pokla0ug_11-1-rgb_front once he gets up to the line of scrimmage and he can get involved in the play he is either got to do one of two things
484pokla0ug_12_13-1-rgb_front break down and float in and make the open field tackle or two he may have to come in and help a team mate out
484pokla0ug_14-1-rgb_front and maybe get a strip cause a fumble and finish out the play
484pokla0ug_15-1-rgb_front so its very important for our defensive backs to be able to read shed block come up and make tackles
484pokla0ug_16-1-rgb_front now our safety that is back he is probably not going to make a whole lot of tackles in the run game but he still has to try to find the ball come up and try to help out
484pokla0ug_2-1-rgb_front obviously the main thing to the defense is we want to stop the run
484pokla0ug_3-1-rgb_front we believe that this team offensively is going to run the ball the majority of the time and we do not have to worry a whole lot about the pass
484pokla0ug_4-1-rgb_front but the first responsibility of this guy has got to be do not get burnt on the pass play
484pokla0ug_5-1-rgb_front so first of all when the ball is snapped he has got to start his back peddle
484pokla0ug_6-1-rgb_front he is got to pick up the quarterback
484pokla0ug_7-1-rgb_front he is got to find out if the quarterback handed the ball off or if he is dropping back so that he has to go into pass coverage
484pokla0ug_8-1-rgb_front once he recognizes that that guy has handed the ball off he has to first of all get this guy off of him who is going to be coming out to block him
484pokla0ug_9_10-1-rgb_front he is got to stay low get into him shed the block and then he is got to come up as hard as he can
48dncks_yn0_0-8-rgb_front hi there this is curtis carter and this particular drill is called pro passing and defense
48dncks_yn0_1-8-rgb_front again being a well rounded player you do not want to be one dimensional so you want to be complete in every way
48dncks_yn0_10-8-rgb_front pass it thumbs down
48dncks_yn0_11-8-rgb_front and i would also like to say that when you pass the ball you want to step forward into the pass thumbs down ok
48dncks_yn0_12-8-rgb_front into the pass thumbs down
48dncks_yn0_13-8-rgb_front again
48dncks_yn0_14-8-rgb_front into the pass thumbs down ok
48dncks_yn0_15-8-rgb_front now a regular pass thumbs down ok
48dncks_yn0_16-8-rgb_front and you get it to him
48dncks_yn0_17-8-rgb_front nice chest pass
48dncks_yn0_18-8-rgb_front ok
48dncks_yn0_19-8-rgb_front right in the chest
48dncks_yn0_2-8-rgb_front being complete is also knowing how to pass the basketball as a guard and a big guy and playing defense
48dncks_yn0_20-8-rgb_front thumbs down forward
48dncks_yn0_21-8-rgb_front forward
48dncks_yn0_22-8-rgb_front i will step back same thing
48dncks_yn0_23-8-rgb_front you want to step into the pass
48dncks_yn0_24-8-rgb_front create momentum as you pass the ball ok
48dncks_yn0_25-8-rgb_front chest pass right
48dncks_yn0_26-8-rgb_front extend good
48dncks_yn0_27-8-rgb_front so then i will step back some more this here is the lengthy chest pass
48dncks_yn0_28-8-rgb_front chest pass
48dncks_yn0_29-8-rgb_front right
48dncks_yn0_3-8-rgb_front championship teams begin with defense and we are going to play pro defense
48dncks_yn0_30-8-rgb_front you are coming down transition your man cuts you hit him with a chest pass
48dncks_yn0_31-8-rgb_front right on his chest
48dncks_yn0_32-8-rgb_front couple of dribbles hit him chest pass right
48dncks_yn0_33-8-rgb_front its real smooth just nonchalant you come down step through chest pass
48dncks_yn0_34-8-rgb_front just hit him right there he dribbles comes down man cuts to the basket chest pass right
48dncks_yn0_35-8-rgb_front that there is pro conditioning drills chest pass defense
48dncks_yn0_4-8-rgb_front first drill we are going to is a simple chest pass
48dncks_yn0_5-8-rgb_front i will start slow i will go close medium to the free throw line and back just chest passing
48dncks_yn0_6-8-rgb_front it s very important that you have a strong firm chest pass
48dncks_yn0_7-8-rgb_front find the on teammate is chest and hit him right in the middle
48dncks_yn0_8-8-rgb_front in all aspects of the game when you are passing with the chest pass
48dncks_yn0_9-8-rgb_front start up close and the important thing is as you do the chest pass you want to pass it thumbs down
48qmlvn7fqq_0-8-rgb_front hello folks
48qmlvn7fqq_1-8-rgb_front in this clip i am going to teach you how to draw a jeans and outfit for our girl here
48qmlvn7fqq_10-8-rgb_front not really necessary but again that is entirely up to you
48qmlvn7fqq_11_12_13-8-rgb_front come down here we will draw the legs and we will see since we are drawing jeans we are going to come down all the way to the bottom here and draw the bottom of the jeans
48qmlvn7fqq_14-8-rgb_front come up top and draw some pockets
48qmlvn7fqq_15-8-rgb_front even if you want to come in here and draw some belt loops maybe a button
48qmlvn7fqq_16-8-rgb_front it is up to you
48qmlvn7fqq_17-8-rgb_front and since i would make these jeans not completely form fitting
48qmlvn7fqq_18-8-rgb_front i might come down here maybe add some wrinkles along the sides
48qmlvn7fqq_19-8-rgb_front come on down you can add a little more depth to the bottom
48qmlvn7fqq_2-8-rgb_front and i will just dive right in
48qmlvn7fqq_20-8-rgb_front make sure you clearly know where the knees are
48qmlvn7fqq_21-8-rgb_front draw some slippers on our girl
48qmlvn7fqq_22-8-rgb_front but yeah there you have it
48qmlvn7fqq_23-8-rgb_front the jeans and look
48qmlvn7fqq_24-8-rgb_front fairly simple straight forward good basic outfit
48qmlvn7fqq_3-8-rgb_front draw her upper body and her neck just like that
48qmlvn7fqq_4-8-rgb_front come on down shoulders and all the way down to her waist
48qmlvn7fqq_5-8-rgb_front draw her arms coming down this way
48qmlvn7fqq_6-8-rgb_front forearms and the fingers kind of resting on what will be her hips
48qmlvn7fqq_7-8-rgb_front alright so now to draw the
48qmlvn7fqq_8-8-rgb_front what we are going to do is we are going to come in here and we will just draw a little swoop just like that for the top of the and then just come in here and draw the sleeves like so
48qmlvn7fqq_9-8-rgb_front you can obviously add a design to the shirt if you want to
49p4e1dlm6w_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is colin kilbane and i am going to show you how to make a small volcano

49p4e1dlm6w_19-5-rgb_front and now we are ready to make our volcano erupt
49p4e1dlm6w_19-8-rgb_front and now we are ready to make our volcano erupt
49p4e1dlm6w_2-5-rgb_front okay
49p4e1dlm6w_2-8-rgb_front okay
49p4e1dlm6w_20-5-rgb_front give it a really good squirt of lava in there
49p4e1dlm6w_20-8-rgb_front give it a really good squirt of lava in there
49p4e1dlm6w_21-5-rgb_front there we go
49p4e1dlm6w_21-8-rgb_front there we go
49p4e1dlm6w_22-5-rgb_front now if you build the volcano you can put sand or paper mache or foam around your flask or your bottle and make a real volcano
49p4e1dlm6w_22-8-rgb_front now if you build the volcano you can put sand or paper mache or foam around your flask or your bottle and make a real volcano
49p4e1dlm6w_23-5-rgb_front now this one is great for small children because we just have baking soda and vinegar there is no hot water there is no complicated setup
49p4e1dlm6w_23-8-rgb_front now this one is great for small children because we just have baking soda and vinegar there is no hot water there is no complicated setup
49p4e1dlm6w_24-5-rgb_front there is fewer things to go wrong
49p4e1dlm6w_24-8-rgb_front there is fewer things to go wrong
49p4e1dlm6w_25-5-rgb_front and you can keep on adding until you are out of baking soda that works great with groups of children
49p4e1dlm6w_25-8-rgb_front and you can keep on adding until you are out of baking soda that works great with groups of children
49p4e1dlm6w_26-5-rgb_front each of them can put a squirt of lava in
49p4e1dlm6w_26-8-rgb_front each of them can put a squirt of lava in
49p4e1dlm6w_27-5-rgb_front and there we have it that is how to make a small volcano
49p4e1dlm6w_27-8-rgb_front and there we have it that is how to make a small volcano
49p4e1dlm6w_3-5-rgb_front first thing you need is your volcano
49p4e1dlm6w_3-8-rgb_front first thing you need is your volcano
49p4e1dlm6w_4-5-rgb_front i am using a little flask here but you can use a pop bottle
49p4e1dlm6w_4-8-rgb_front i am using a little flask here but you can use a pop bottle
49p4e1dlm6w_5-5-rgb_front one of those little pop bottles
49p4e1dlm6w_5-8-rgb_front one of those little pop bottles
49p4e1dlm6w_6-5-rgb_front anything that is got a narrow mouth on it
49p4e1dlm6w_6-8-rgb_front anything that is got a narrow mouth on it
49p4e1dlm6w_7-5-rgb_front it will help out
49p4e1dlm6w_7-8-rgb_front it will help out
49p4e1dlm6w_8-5-rgb_front now i have got a little cake pan here just to catch our lava so we do not make too big of a mess
49p4e1dlm6w_8-8-rgb_front now i have got a little cake pan here just to catch our lava so we do not make too big of a mess
49p4e1dlm6w_9-5-rgb_front now our lava let is make our lava
49p4e1dlm6w_9-8-rgb_front now our lava let is make our lava
4a6qfusqspa_0-5-rgb_front in this segment what we are going to do is download the third program which is firefox which is a browser alternative and we are going to start with the screen at the point of the last segment we did
4a6qfusqspa_1-5-rgb_front so we just are in any window it does not make any difference where you ended up in download
4a6qfusqspa_2-5-rgb_front download com you can just go to the search window and click and let is type in firefox
4a6qfusqspa_3-5-rgb_front anyway we are going to go over here and click go and it is going to come up with the search results and sure enough this is the program that we want right here
4a6qfusqspa_4-5-rgb_front we are going to go to download now and then we are going to save with that and it is still pointing to local c downloads that is great and then you say save
4a6qfusqspa_5-5-rgb_front so firefox is coming down to the computer and it is going to give us all three programs in the download program and we will be in a position to execute those programs in the next segment
4af-nxpvbgy_1-5-rgb_front we are working with our wide receivers right now and we are working on some patterns they can run to get themselves open and hopefully make a big play for your offense
4af-nxpvbgy_10-5-rgb_front one thing to make sure of in the post route is that you really push that defensive back and get him in the back peddle so they think you are going long
4af-nxpvbgy_11-5-rgb_front then you will break it off and go straight across the field and the quarterback will try to hit you with more of a deep route than the slant video demo
4af-nxpvbgy_12-5-rgb_front you can see he took more of a deep route and we picked up a lot more yardage than we would if we just ran a quick slant
4af-nxpvbgy_13-5-rgb_front that is called a post route
4af-nxpvbgy_2-5-rgb_front we are going to talk about the post route
4af-nxpvbgy_3-5-rgb_front it is very similar to the slant route except we want to go a little deeper with it and more straight across as opposed to a degree angle
4af-nxpvbgy_4-5-rgb_front the quick slant route is to get us a quick pass in the middle to try to go behind the linebackers and pick up about or yards
4af-nxpvbgy_5-5-rgb_front with a post route we want to pick up more like or yards
4af-nxpvbgy_6-5-rgb_front so we want to go a little deeper
4af-nxpvbgy_7-5-rgb_front we will have our receiver push the defensive back off
4af-nxpvbgy_8-5-rgb_front when he gets about to yards he will head across the field and the quarterback will throw him more of a deep pattern and let him go get the ball
4af-nxpvbgy_9-5-rgb_front let is run it at full speed instead of the walk through video demo
4bkuil-ou2q_0_2-8-rgb_front hi i am john jackson from remax suburban in st louis missouri i am going to talk to you a little bit about that and how that process works
4bkuil-ou2q_10-8-rgb_front for example very often in my market garages are added after the home was built
4bkuil-ou2q_11-8-rgb_front building requirements change constantly so it is entirely possible that a garage that was built fifty or sixty years ago may in fact sit over a property line even by just a small number of inches and if that is the case and your neighbor then decides they would like your garage removed from their property that obviously affects the value of the home
4bkuil-ou2q_12-8-rgb_front and that is one example i can use to demonstrate the importance of having a survey performed on the property that you are purchasing
4bkuil-ou2q_3-8-rgb_front i am going to talk to you a little bit about that and how that process works
4bkuil-ou2q_4-8-rgb_front the survey is an overhead drawing a sketch made by the land surveying company
4bkuil-ou2q_5-8-rgb_front they actually draw out the property as it sits within the boundary lines and all the improvements on the property
4bkuil-ou2q_6-8-rgb_front it will show decks and porches and make sure that everything is built within the regulations for that local municipality
4bkuil-ou2q_7-8-rgb_front i am standing next to a sewer discharge
4bkuil-ou2q_8-8-rgb_front this is actually water rain retention discharge so the survey may in fact show that the sewer company maintains the right to have access to this small area
4bkuil-ou2q_9-8-rgb_front the survey will show any encroachments from your property onto a neighbor is property as well as any neighbor is property onto your property that may affect the value down the road
4bzvj8fddvy_1-5-rgb_front today we are here to talk about low maintenance gardening
4bzvj8fddvy_1-8-rgb_front today we are here to talk about low maintenance gardening
4bzvj8fddvy_10-5-rgb_front so what i like to do to ensure that you get the whole root and all is use your little cultivator and dig down right next to the root and loosen it up because if you just try to pull it you might leave a little piece of root in there and that could actually propagate new weed growth
4bzvj8fddvy_10-8-rgb_front so what i like to do to ensure that you get the whole root and all is use your little cultivator and dig down right next to the root and loosen it up because if you just try to pull it you might leave a little piece of root in there and that could actually propagate new weed growth
4bzvj8fddvy_11-5-rgb_front so you want to take it wiggle it as you pull it up and get that whole root and do not just throw the weeds on your lawn
4bzvj8fddvy_11-8-rgb_front so you want to take it wiggle it as you pull it up and get that whole root and do not just throw the weeds on your lawn
4bzvj8fddvy_12-5-rgb_front keep a container nearby a box or a bucket or something throw them in a bucket and then get rid of the weed somewhere else because if you throw it in your lawn you are probably just going to grow weed right there
4bzvj8fddvy_12-8-rgb_front keep a container nearby a box or a bucket or something throw them in a bucket and then get rid of the weed somewhere else because if you throw it in your lawn you are probably just going to grow weed right there
4bzvj8fddvy_2-5-rgb_front okay now here is a subject that we do not really like to talk about or even think about and that is weeding
4bzvj8fddvy_2-8-rgb_front okay now here is a subject that we do not really like to talk about or even think about and that is weeding
4bzvj8fddvy_3-5-rgb_front every garden is going to grow weeds
4bzvj8fddvy_3-8-rgb_front every garden is going to grow weeds
4bzvj8fddvy_4-5-rgb_front there is not really much that you can do to prevent it
4bzvj8fddvy_4-8-rgb_front there is not really much that you can do to prevent it
4bzvj8fddvy_5-5-rgb_front so my advice is to weed before you really have to weed
4bzvj8fddvy_5-8-rgb_front so my advice is to weed before you really have to weed
4bzvj8fddvy_6-5-rgb_front what i try to do is get out in my garden for an hour a week just to weed
4bzvj8fddvy_6-8-rgb_front what i try to do is get out in my garden for an hour a week just to weed
4bzvj8fddvy_7-5-rgb_front another advantage of a small garden is there is not that many weeds
4bzvj8fddvy_7-8-rgb_front another advantage of a small garden is there is not that many weeds
4bzvj8fddvy_8-5-rgb_front so do not let them get out of hand it is not that much of a hassle
4bzvj8fddvy_8-8-rgb_front so do not let them get out of hand it is not that much of a hassle
4bzvj8fddvy_9-5-rgb_front now you can go out and cut your weeds with a hoe which a lot of people do and i do not like to do that cause that is just going to stimulate more weed growth
4bzvj8fddvy_9-8-rgb_front now you can go out and cut your weeds with a hoe which a lot of people do and i do not like to do that cause that is just going to stimulate more weed growth
4c6uadtf65i_0-5-rgb_front now another thing that you can do with your wax is use it as a decorative effect
4c6uadtf65i_0-8-rgb_front now another thing that you can do with your wax is use it as a decorative effect
4c6uadtf65i_1-5-rgb_front the way that that works you go ahead and put the wax where it is needed on the pot
4c6uadtf65i_1-8-rgb_front the way that that works you go ahead and put the wax where it is needed on the pot
4c6uadtf65i_10-5-rgb_front which in this case will turn dark brown
4c6uadtf65i_10-8-rgb_front which in this case will turn dark brown
4c6uadtf65i_2-5-rgb_front in this case on the bottom
4c6uadtf65i_2-8-rgb_front in this case on the bottom
4c6uadtf65i_3-5-rgb_front now clearly we do not need the wax resist anywhere else on this pot but what you can do is take your brush load it up with your hot wax and make a design on the pot
4c6uadtf65i_3-8-rgb_front now clearly we do not need the wax resist anywhere else on this pot but what you can do is take your brush load it up with your hot wax and make a design on the pot
4c6uadtf65i_4-5-rgb_front it can be anything
4c6uadtf65i_4-8-rgb_front it can be anything
4c6uadtf65i_5-5-rgb_front it could be just little squiggles you can draw an actual character anything you have interest to put on there
4c6uadtf65i_5-8-rgb_front it could be just little squiggles you can draw an actual character anything you have interest to put on there
4c6uadtf65i_6-5-rgb_front and what this is going to do is when you go to dip this pot in the glaze which i will demonstrate in a moment this glaze will resist i mean this wax will resist the glaze
4c6uadtf65i_6-8-rgb_front and what this is going to do is when you go to dip this pot in the glaze which i will demonstrate in a moment this glaze will resist i mean this wax will resist the glaze
4c6uadtf65i_7-5-rgb_front you will be left with bare clay anywhere that you have brushed this wax
4c6uadtf65i_7-8-rgb_front you will be left with bare clay anywhere that you have brushed this wax
4c6uadtf65i_8-5-rgb_front but what is kind of cool about it is usually your glaze is going to have kind of a halo edge around every place where it stops
4c6uadtf65i_8-8-rgb_front but what is kind of cool about it is usually your glaze is going to have kind of a halo edge around every place where it stops
4c6uadtf65i_9-5-rgb_front so you will have your glaze a little bit of a halo seeping into the wax area and then these nice decorative areas that you have left blank
4c6uadtf65i_9-8-rgb_front so you will have your glaze a little bit of a halo seeping into the wax area and then these nice decorative areas that you have left blank
4ciac6tpz8o_0-3-rgb_front before i put the rattle together first i have got to make things that rattle so all you do is take a little piece of clay and just make a bunch of little beads
4ciac6tpz8o_1-3-rgb_front now the smaller these beads are the more of them you can fit in there the higher pitch they are going to be
4ciac6tpz8o_2-3-rgb_front so i like to make a bunch of different sizes so that you get kind of a nice varied tone
4ciac6tpz8o_3-3-rgb_front and with these little beads rolling them on the canvas like this the surfaces of them are going to be pretty dry but it is kind of nice to let them sit up for about five to ten minutes before you put your rattle together so that they are not going to stick to the inside of your rattle
4ciac6tpz8o_4-3-rgb_front and i would say go ahead and keep rolling these until you have a small handful
4ciac6tpz8o_5-3-rgb_front you need to have enough so that you will get decent sound
4ciac6tpz8o_6-3-rgb_front and they do not need to be perfectly round it does not really matter what shape they end up being
4ciac6tpz8o_7-3-rgb_front so just keep going with that for a few minutes and few seconds until you have got enough and then i will put the rattle together
4chfh4ldxvg_0-8-rgb_front o k
4chfh4ldxvg_1-8-rgb_front as part of safety go we went through the s a is for atmosphere
4chfh4ldxvg_10-8-rgb_front so if you will kind of look up on top the arrow up on top is a wind indicator and that points in the direction the wind is coming from
4chfh4ldxvg_11-8-rgb_front so the front of the arrow there is pointing in the direction of the wind
4chfh4ldxvg_12-8-rgb_front it will swing around there depending which ever way the wind is coming
4chfh4ldxvg_13_14_15-8-rgb_front and other indicators are flags on boats tell them to show you which direction the wind is coming from we also have other indicator is to get the some information on when it is coming from such as burgees and flags flying on other boats which we have over here on the kings slip behind us
4chfh4ldxvg_2-8-rgb_front you not only want to know what the weather is like conditions whether it is cloudy overcast sunny rainy foggy but you also want to know the direction the wind is coming from and how hard it is blowing
4chfh4ldxvg_3-8-rgb_front cause believe it not there you can take your boat out raise sails and you can sail all over the bay but where you are going to run into difficulties is when you are coming back and docking the boat or leaving the dock
4chfh4ldxvg_4-8-rgb_front so the main thing to remember if anything else is the direction the wind is coming from and how hard it is blowing cause it will do goofy things to your boat o k
4chfh4ldxvg_5-8-rgb_front and how do you really determine the wind
4chfh4ldxvg_6-8-rgb_front do you listen to local channels
4chfh4ldxvg_7-8-rgb_front do you have a weather device on board
4chfh4ldxvg_8-8-rgb_front yea there is certain different ways out there you can listen to the weather forecast in the morning there or you could get a hold of any of the news channels out and lot of marinas also have anemometer with gives you what the wind is blowing but also when you are in the marina you can just feel it on your face your hair
4chfh4ldxvg_9-8-rgb_front also one of the other indicators that you will be able to use to tell which direction the wind is coming from is wind indexes on top of the mast of the boat
4efbr4oe2ze_0-8-rgb_front hi
4efbr4oe2ze_1-8-rgb_front my name is ashley ludman from seaside yoga
4efbr4oe2ze_10-8-rgb_front it affects our physiological systems
4efbr4oe2ze_11-8-rgb_front when we are bending forward in forward bends we are creating an internal massage to our digestive system
4efbr4oe2ze_12-8-rgb_front when we are going into spinal twist we are creating a massaging action for the intervertebral joints
4efbr4oe2ze_13-8-rgb_front so in essence our yoga practice benefits our physical body not just in our strength and our flexibility but it also benefits our internal organ functions
4efbr4oe2ze_14-8-rgb_front it affects brain control and mindfulness of stress reduction
4efbr4oe2ze_15-8-rgb_front so it affects our body in so many different ways and i hope you find the great affects and i hope your body enjoys your yoga practice
4efbr4oe2ze_2-8-rgb_front so the question is what does yoga do for the body
4efbr4oe2ze_3-8-rgb_front a lot of times we think of yoga as being a tool to help us gain flexibility and many people that i meet on the street and talk to about yoga they think that they cannot do yoga because they are not flexible enough
4efbr4oe2ze_4-8-rgb_front well in essence they are strong so strength and flexibility are a great marriage for any type of yoga posture
4efbr4oe2ze_5-8-rgb_front so physically the postures or the asanas that we perform in a yoga class on a yoga mat help us to find that balance within
4efbr4oe2ze_6-8-rgb_front when you are in a new posture you might start to be aware of your legs
4efbr4oe2ze_7-8-rgb_front you might start to be more aware of your hips more aware of how your core supports you
4efbr4oe2ze_8-8-rgb_front how your shoulders need to open up so that you can gain more breathe within your lungs
4efbr4oe2ze_9-8-rgb_front so yoga affects the body in the external form but also internally
4fvc5mu1v0k_0-5-rgb_front i am wearing pattern jacket pattern checkered jacket with a low cut neck line sleeves and the waist of this jacket
4fvc5mu1v0k_1-5-rgb_front as you can see the length of this jacket as you can see falls slightly below my waist
4fvc5mu1v0k_2-5-rgb_front as long as the jacket is not fitting or above my waist then i am safe because on a tall woman any jacket that hits the waist or below the waist is not going to look proportional
4fvc5mu1v0k_3-5-rgb_front now in addition to this jacket here i put together a skirt that falls very natural and very nicely with the jacket it is a black skirt black fitted pencil skirt and a pair of shoes which has a small here which completes the look
4fvc5mu1v0k_4-5-rgb_front and makes it look very elegant and even though my shoes are not black which would be a total match to the outfit
4fvc5mu1v0k_5-5-rgb_front it is dark brown but still it completes the color it brings out the style
4fvc5mu1v0k_6-5-rgb_front and also always keep in mind that your upper shoulders should not be over sized as well as your bust line or your waist length
4fvc5mu1v0k_7-5-rgb_front everything should be kept proportional
4fvc5mu1v0k_8-5-rgb_front and this is one more way to show how simple a nice outfit can be put for a tall woman
4g2tec5ls_g_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to make a beautiful mushroom and butterfly incense burner out of polymer clay
4g2tec5ls_g_10-5-rgb_front so we are going to start with the outside top wing
4g2tec5ls_g_11-5-rgb_front you are going to draw a butterfly without the body
4g2tec5ls_g_12-5-rgb_front so you are going to draw the wings as one whole piece and you do not want to get too complicated because again we are going to cut this out and it is very flimsy so you do not want to get too elaborate
4g2tec5ls_g_13-5-rgb_front just make a simple butterfly shape cutting through with your poker
4g2tec5ls_g_14-5-rgb_front you want to lift it up when you are done
4g2tec5ls_g_15-5-rgb_front shape the wings even them out if you have to
4g2tec5ls_g_16-5-rgb_front you can test it out and if it looks like it is going to be too big then you can make it smaller
4g2tec5ls_g_17-5-rgb_front if it looks like it is too small then you can add more
4g2tec5ls_g_18-5-rgb_front i think this is a really nice size
4g2tec5ls_g_2-5-rgb_front in this next step we are going to create the butterfly wings that are going to go on the butterfly of our mushroom
4g2tec5ls_g_3-5-rgb_front so we are going to select our colors for the butterfly and we had picked blue
4g2tec5ls_g_4-5-rgb_front we are going to add some white and some clear
4g2tec5ls_g_5-5-rgb_front you really do not want to make this very big because our mushroom is not very big
4g2tec5ls_g_6-5-rgb_front you do not want this huge butterfly creature that is going to overpower the entire thing
4g2tec5ls_g_7-5-rgb_front you are aiming for about one forth inch thickness
4g2tec5ls_g_8-5-rgb_front that is the goal
4g2tec5ls_g_9-5-rgb_front basically you are going to draw a butterfly
4gknutxcey8_0-5-rgb_front alright if you are new to preparing tea an important thing for me to talk about is steeping or brewing
4gknutxcey8_1-5-rgb_front in this series you will hear me use the words steeping and brewing interchangeably
4gknutxcey8_2-5-rgb_front now what i mean by steeping or brewing your tea is you are adding hot water to the tea leaves and allowing them a certain amount of time for all of the flavor the caffeine the healthy antioxidants and all that is tea to escape from the leaves into the water or you know to join in and become defused into the water
4gknutxcey8_3-5-rgb_front so that is what it is to brew a cup a pot of tea is simply to join it with hot water and allow the hot water to join the tea leaves and become a cup of tea
4gknutxcey8_4-5-rgb_front so again that is steeping and brewing
4gknutxcey8_5-5-rgb_front you will hear me saying that a whole lot
4gknutxcey8_6-5-rgb_front do not get confused
4gknutxcey8_7-5-rgb_front it just the process of making a cup of tea
4h7wucscirg_1-5-rgb_front this is part three of the series and we will be the second side dish that will be creole style green beans
4h7wucscirg_1-8-rgb_front this is part three of the series and we will be the second side dish that will be creole style green beans
4h7wucscirg_2-5-rgb_front we are taking our bacon the pieces that we cut and now we are rendering that in a heavy pot here and we want to render a lot of the bacon fat off
4h7wucscirg_2-8-rgb_front we are taking our bacon the pieces that we cut and now we are rendering that in a heavy pot here and we want to render a lot of the bacon fat off
4h7wucscirg_3-5-rgb_front because its flavor from the bacon fat that is going to give the green beans a nice smoky flavor
4h7wucscirg_3-8-rgb_front because its flavor from the bacon fat that is going to give the green beans a nice smoky flavor
4h7wucscirg_4-5-rgb_front and we want this bacon to crisp up a little bit so we render we are doing this on a medium high heat and you know you just move it around you do not want it to burn it can let is sit for a little bit
4h7wucscirg_4-8-rgb_front and we want this bacon to crisp up a little bit so we render we are doing this on a medium high heat and you know you just move it around you do not want it to burn it can let is sit for a little bit
4h7wucscirg_5-5-rgb_front and just stay attentive to it always pay attention to it cause you do not really want it to burn
4h7wucscirg_5-8-rgb_front and just stay attentive to it always pay attention to it cause you do not really want it to burn
4h7wucscirg_6-5-rgb_front if you did not want to use bacon you can use ham you can use canadian bacon but like i said i like to use the hickory smoke just for that smoky flavor
4h7wucscirg_6-8-rgb_front if you did not want to use bacon you can use ham you can use canadian bacon but like i said i like to use the hickory smoke just for that smoky flavor
4h7wucscirg_7-5-rgb_front and if while you are doing this your oil starts to pop it means that the heat is too high just turn it down a notch and keep going
4h7wucscirg_7-8-rgb_front and if while you are doing this your oil starts to pop it means that the heat is too high just turn it down a notch and keep going
4h7wucscirg_8-5-rgb_front so anyway we will continue to render our bacon and watch our next step
4h7wucscirg_8-8-rgb_front so anyway we will continue to render our bacon and watch our next step
4i2azcr2kca_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is chris from aquatic central here in san francisco and on the web at com and i would like to tell you how to tell if your fish is sick
4i2azcr2kca_1-8-rgb_front generally the easiest way to tell if a fish is sick is by visual inspection
4i2azcr2kca_10-8-rgb_front for example a fish is lethargic not swimming around maybe resting at the bottom
4i2azcr2kca_11-8-rgb_front a fish may show signs of rapid breathing
4i2azcr2kca_12-8-rgb_front a fish may show a lack of appetite
4i2azcr2kca_13-8-rgb_front these will be other ways of trying to identify whether your fish is sick
4i2azcr2kca_14-8-rgb_front again it is important to try to keep an eye on your fish regularly to see how he normally behaves and how he normally looks
4i2azcr2kca_15-8-rgb_front sometimes it would also behoove you to do a little bit of research on the type of fish you have to see what common ailments they do suffer from
4i2azcr2kca_16-8-rgb_front that way it will help you to identify when that fish is sick
4i2azcr2kca_17-8-rgb_front again this is how you can tell if a fish is sick
4i2azcr2kca_18-8-rgb_front my name is chris with aquatic central here in san francisco and on the web at com
4i2azcr2kca_2-8-rgb_front usually you will have to get a little bit familiar with how your fish looks so this will require regular inspections
4i2azcr2kca_3-8-rgb_front that way you will be able to distinguish when there are differences
4i2azcr2kca_4-8-rgb_front usually there will be either fungus bacteria or parasitic diseases or infections
4i2azcr2kca_5-8-rgb_front most of them can be identified by a visual inspection either by white tufts or cottony growths
4i2azcr2kca_6-8-rgb_front there could be small animals growing on your fish
4i2azcr2kca_7-8-rgb_front there could be a loss of coloration a loss of scale or rotting decaying fins
4i2azcr2kca_8-8-rgb_front usually it is pretty easy to tell when a fish is sick
4i2azcr2kca_9-8-rgb_front sometimes there will be more innocuous symptoms which will require just behavioral monitoring
4k6kvm-nryq_1-8-rgb_front now the first step in finding a good mechanic is you can talk with your friends
4k6kvm-nryq_10-8-rgb_front which means that the mechanics have passed a test that says that they have the mechanic skills that are required hopefully to fix your vehicle
4k6kvm-nryq_11-8-rgb_front and also you can look up if the shop is triple a accredited
4k6kvm-nryq_12-8-rgb_front this means that their work and services have been verified by triple a
4k6kvm-nryq_13-8-rgb_front once you have picked a mechanic they are several things you can look for when you go to the shop
4k6kvm-nryq_14-8-rgb_front first thing is you can look for posted prices on the wall and the prices that you were quoted over the phone should be similar or be the same as those prices that are posted
4k6kvm-nryq_15-8-rgb_front once you bring your car in you should be able to have the mechanic look over your car and assess any repairs that need to be made
4k6kvm-nryq_16-8-rgb_front and before any work is actually done on the vehicle you are entitled to approve that work
4k6kvm-nryq_17-8-rgb_front so if you know what repairs need to be made to your car you can call around to dealers or other parts shops and find out how much that part should cost
4k6kvm-nryq_18-8-rgb_front the mechanic doing the service work on your car may charge a little bit more but the price should be within the relative ball park of any other retailer
4k6kvm-nryq_19-8-rgb_front so if you believe that any of the work that a mechanic may recommend is not valid you can always take your vehicle to another mechanic and ask for a second opinion
4k6kvm-nryq_2-8-rgb_front hopefully if they have the same make and model of your car they will have a little insight into who can help you out
4k6kvm-nryq_20-8-rgb_front before the work has begun you should ask the mechanic how long the warranty is on both the parts and the labor
4k6kvm-nryq_21-8-rgb_front and also ask him to give a full explanation of the work with details of what exactly is wrong with your vehicle and what needs to be changed
4k6kvm-nryq_22-8-rgb_front so once you approve the work on your vehicle be sure to tell the mechanic to keep all the old parts
4k6kvm-nryq_23-8-rgb_front because once the work is done you want to take a look at the old part and verify that the part had actually been changed for a new one
4k6kvm-nryq_3_4-8-rgb_front now the next thing that you can do is to look in your local phonebook now what you want to do is after you look up several car mechanics in your area you want to give them a call and if you know what service you need with your vehicle you can ask for a price quote or an approximate quote and compare several prices and you should be able to tell what the average price should be for a certain job
4k6kvm-nryq_5-8-rgb_front so you want to look for a mechanic that specializes in your particular make
4k6kvm-nryq_6-8-rgb_front say if your car is made in japan and is of a certain model that they specialize in that
4k6kvm-nryq_7-8-rgb_front since they probably have more experience with that model of car they will probably do a better job
4k6kvm-nryq_8-8-rgb_front so another thing you can do when deciding which mechanic you should go to is you can go to the better business bureaus website and you can look up the name of the company and see if there is any complaints or how the customers have rated that particular mechanic
4k6kvm-nryq_9-8-rgb_front another thing you can look for when looking up a mechanic is you should be able to find out whether they have ase certified mechanics
4k_famyad2o_0-8-rgb_front before becoming a professional hairstylist i had no idea there was even a difference between curling irons
4k_famyad2o_1-8-rgb_front i am laura gibson beauty expert here to tell you the different between curling irons
4k_famyad2o_10-8-rgb_front so once again there are three types of curling irons
4k_famyad2o_11-8-rgb_front chrome gold and ceramic
4k_famyad2o_12-8-rgb_front its all about what you want
4k_famyad2o_13-8-rgb_front i am laura gibson beauty expert
4k_famyad2o_2-8-rgb_front there is three types
4k_famyad2o_3-8-rgb_front one would be your chrome curling iron your gold curling iron and your ceramic curling iron
4k_famyad2o_4-8-rgb_front now the different between the three varies
4k_famyad2o_5-8-rgb_front for example the first one which everyone usually likes to go because it will save you a penny that would be your chrome
4k_famyad2o_6-8-rgb_front the second one is more for someone who uses their flat iron but not everyday that would be your gold
4k_famyad2o_7-8-rgb_front now however if you are a curling iron junkie like me you are going to want to what
4k_famyad2o_8-8-rgb_front you are going to want to go with ceramic
4k_famyad2o_9-8-rgb_front ceramic actually seals your cuticle to leave you with that silky smooth finish
4k_f93m-bra_0-8-rgb_front the next thing we are going to talk about is heating your blood python
4k_f93m-bra_1-8-rgb_front generally especially when you start off small the baby in like a fifteen gallon aquarium we are going to be talking about light bulbs as far as heating
4k_f93m-bra_10-8-rgb_front then we are going to be looking at is you need two heat bulbs
4k_f93m-bra_11-8-rgb_front you need a day bulb and a night bulb
4k_f93m-bra_12-8-rgb_front generally your night bulb which will be a red bulb or a blue bulb or a black bulb colored so that the reptile does not see it at night so much and it allows them to sleep is going to be a slightly lower wattage than say your day bulb which will be on during the day
4k_f93m-bra_13-8-rgb_front usually you want like a seventy five watt night bulb and a hundred watt day bulb something like that
4k_f93m-bra_14-8-rgb_front every house is going to differ depending on the temperature you keep it in
4k_f93m-bra_15-8-rgb_front so you are going to have to play with your wattages a little bit to find the right temperatures
4k_f93m-bra_16-8-rgb_front what we are really looking for here is somewhere in the eighty five to ninety degree temperature range on the high end for your blood python and in the low end somewhere around eighty five to eighty degrees
4k_f93m-bra_2-8-rgb_front it is going to be the most accessible and affordable way for you to heat a beginning enclosure
4k_f93m-bra_3-8-rgb_front what you are going to need is you are going to need two heat lamp fixtures
4k_f93m-bra_4-8-rgb_front you want to make sure those heat lamp fixtures have a ceramic base not plastic plastic melts and it becomes a fire hazard
4k_f93m-bra_5-8-rgb_front we do not want that
4k_f93m-bra_6-8-rgb_front i know people who have burnt their houses down not buying the correct equipment
4k_f93m-bra_7-8-rgb_front so make sure it is a ceramic base and also make sure that it is rated the right amount of wattages we are going to be using
4k_f93m-bra_8-8-rgb_front this generally i recommend people buy the highest rating wattage they can get that way in case they need to upgrade the light bulb they are going to be using they are already ready to go
4k_f93m-bra_9-8-rgb_front this guy as you can see right here is only rated for seventy five watts today
4mipkk7f4gm_0-5-rgb_front in this segment we are going to be talking about another trick type of a brush and this going to be behind the back brush
4mipkk7f4gm_1-5-rgb_front now to do the behind the back brush obviously it has to be somewhere around your waist
4mipkk7f4gm_10-5-rgb_front there it is
4mipkk7f4gm_11-5-rgb_front there is the nesting
4mipkk7f4gm_12-5-rgb_front so you can do it on either side you just have to be aware of which direction the frisbee is spinning
4mipkk7f4gm_13-5-rgb_front try to make sure you get your body out of the way when you are brushing this way and this way
4mipkk7f4gm_14-5-rgb_front that is a behind the back brush
4mipkk7f4gm_2-5-rgb_front and what you want to do is that is the basic brush but you are going to want to do it so your hand is behind your back
4mipkk7f4gm_3-5-rgb_front now obviously there is not a lot of room there when you are doing a behind the back brush but if you time it just right and get your body out of the way you should be able to do it
4mipkk7f4gm_4-5-rgb_front we are going to do it with a clock spin first
4mipkk7f4gm_5-5-rgb_front from here brush
4mipkk7f4gm_6-5-rgb_front ryan is a little bit better at it so he is going to try a couple of brushes
4mipkk7f4gm_7-5-rgb_front you can do it on either side
4mipkk7f4gm_8-5-rgb_front there is the right handed brush
4mipkk7f4gm_9-5-rgb_front now he is going to try the left handed brush with a clock spin
4mxwmq7ht6e_0-8-rgb_front we are ready now to talk about how this hem is going to look when we are when we are finished
4mxwmq7ht6e_1-8-rgb_front we need to turn it under and pin it but let me show you why we are going to pin it the way we do
4mxwmq7ht6e_10-8-rgb_front so what we want to do is make this mark and this mark meet
4mxwmq7ht6e_11-8-rgb_front and so we just want to grab this mark and just pinch it just like this so it is there on top
4mxwmq7ht6e_12-8-rgb_front and just bring it over
4mxwmq7ht6e_13-8-rgb_front your going to hold it
4mxwmq7ht6e_14-8-rgb_front and you can see
4mxwmq7ht6e_15-8-rgb_front there is a mark here and a mark here
4mxwmq7ht6e_16-8-rgb_front i will have to put my thumb there
4mxwmq7ht6e_17-8-rgb_front my fingernail
4mxwmq7ht6e_18-8-rgb_front feel it
4mxwmq7ht6e_19-8-rgb_front i can tell that it is right there on top
4mxwmq7ht6e_20-8-rgb_front but if you are not quite for sure just grab a pin and just stick it in right where that one mark is and bring it out and look it goes right through to the other mark
4mxwmq7ht6e_21-8-rgb_front so i know that is perfectly where i need it
4mxwmq7ht6e_22-8-rgb_front and so since we know that
4mxwmq7ht6e_23-8-rgb_front this is what the hem is going to look like
4mxwmq7ht6e_24-8-rgb_front we are just going to fold it up again so you can see how well that is going to look
4mxwmq7ht6e_25-8-rgb_front so like i said this is the top of the cuff and the bottom of the cuff
4mxwmq7ht6e_26-8-rgb_front and the final hem
4mxwmq7ht6e_27-8-rgb_front so in the next clip
4mxwmq7ht6e_28-8-rgb_front i will show you how to pin it all the way around and then we will close it up in a few steps later
4mxwmq7ht6e_29-8-rgb_front so let is get started pinning this down
4mxwmq7ht6e_2_3-8-rgb_front so like we said this first mark is our new hem length this mark is going to be the top of the cuff
4mxwmq7ht6e_4-8-rgb_front this mark is the bottom of the cuff
4mxwmq7ht6e_5-8-rgb_front and this mark is what is turned underneath
4mxwmq7ht6e_6-8-rgb_front this this hem is what is turned underneath and hidden away on the inside of the pants
4mxwmq7ht6e_7-8-rgb_front so when we do this cuff what we want to do is make sure this is on top this is going to be right at the top
4mxwmq7ht6e_8-8-rgb_front and it is going to be up here
4mxwmq7ht6e_9-8-rgb_front and this mark and this mark are both one and and inch away from the top of the cuff
4mi3e9rcs_o_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to start moving around a little bit in our hoop
4mi3e9rcs_o_1-8-rgb_front we are going to talk about turning and moving our feet
4mi3e9rcs_o_10-8-rgb_front as you move you can lift one foot up lift the other foot up
4mi3e9rcs_o_11-8-rgb_front you can point a toe moving back and forth
4mi3e9rcs_o_12-8-rgb_front you can bump your hips back and forth and have a lot of fun with it
4mi3e9rcs_o_13-8-rgb_front you can also turn pretty quickly coming up on your toes
4mi3e9rcs_o_14-8-rgb_front you can turn in the other direction a little bit more quickly keeping it going
4mi3e9rcs_o_15-8-rgb_front remember to move around
4mi3e9rcs_o_16-8-rgb_front have fun with the hoop
4mi3e9rcs_o_2-8-rgb_front once again place the hoop on your back and let is give it a whirl
4mi3e9rcs_o_3-8-rgb_front get it spinning
4mi3e9rcs_o_4-8-rgb_front as it is spinning really notice the hoop pressing into your stomach and your back as hannah explained
4mi3e9rcs_o_5-8-rgb_front if you are hooping to your left like we do as the hoop presses into your left hip slowly start to turn your body in small circles
4mi3e9rcs_o_6-8-rgb_front feel how the hoop just glides and guides you around
4mi3e9rcs_o_7-8-rgb_front now if you turn in the opposite direction notice how fast the hoop goes
4mi3e9rcs_o_8-8-rgb_front one you feel like you are kind of in the middle of a blender
4mi3e9rcs_o_9-8-rgb_front it is a really interesting so definitely try turning in the opposite direction
4ojs5bqklio_1-5-rgb_front then we would also if you would like to have like a small drill and parts to go with it that is handy around the house we have this little set that you can you put this into the drill and then you put one of these insert bits and we have those
4ojs5bqklio_2-5-rgb_front it has a magnet and it holds it then you can use it to work on your things with that
4ojs5bqklio_3-5-rgb_front it has a security torque and the torque and the square and the philip is and the flat and a lot of different kinds
4ojs5bqklio_4-5-rgb_front it also has a thing that you can use to for wing nuts on your drill
4ojs5bqklio_5-5-rgb_front then the drill this is a small drill but if you just need it around the house a electric drill and it is only and it is handy to have a drill when you are trying to put up your blinds at the house they work so much better if you have a drill to help you with it
4pe3myd8l3q_0-5-rgb_front hello
4pe3myd8l3q_1-5-rgb_front this is j b
4pe3myd8l3q_10-5-rgb_front if you wanted to you could use the same kind of bottles
4pe3myd8l3q_11-5-rgb_front so with that being said the basic difference between a standard and a champagne bottle is a thick glass the ability to hold carbonation also this little halo of glass
4pe3myd8l3q_12-5-rgb_front why does it have that
4pe3myd8l3q_13-5-rgb_front it has that so that with a champagne bottle you would use a stopper either a plastic type champagne stopper like this one or an actual champagne cork like these guys here
4pe3myd8l3q_14_15-5-rgb_front now champagne corks have their whole another set of circumstances if you use a champagne cork you have to have a champagne corker
4pe3myd8l3q_16-5-rgb_front i unfortunately do not have one in stock right now to show you
4pe3myd8l3q_17-5-rgb_front the only one i have is from italy
4pe3myd8l3q_18-5-rgb_front these things are a little bit of a bear to use
4pe3myd8l3q_19-5-rgb_front so be careful if you are going to get into champagne corking
4pe3myd8l3q_2-5-rgb_front i am with austin homebrew supply here in austin texas
4pe3myd8l3q_20-5-rgb_front most folks will use the little plastic stopper and then you take one of your champagne wires and you put it over the top of it
4pe3myd8l3q_21-5-rgb_front that is where this little halo of glass comes in
4pe3myd8l3q_22-5-rgb_front the halo of glass allows the bottom of the champagne wire to hold on underneath there so that when fermentation develops that cork will not pop right out of the champagne bottle
4pe3myd8l3q_23-5-rgb_front so so champagne bottles are a great way to store your sparkling either champagne or sparkling homemade wines
4pe3myd8l3q_3-5-rgb_front today we are discussing wine equipment right now i want to talk a little bit about champagne bottles
4pe3myd8l3q_4-5-rgb_front now champagne bottles are a catch all term for bottles of this kind of nature right here
4pe3myd8l3q_5-5-rgb_front generally thick walled with a little bit of halo of glass right here
4pe3myd8l3q_6-5-rgb_front champagne bottles unlike a traditional wine bottle champagne bottles are intended to hold pressurized carbonated wine
4pe3myd8l3q_7-5-rgb_front now there are not many wines that are carbonated
4pe3myd8l3q_8-5-rgb_front champagne and also sparkling wines are the only two sparkling wines available on the commercial market or even as a home brewer
4pe3myd8l3q_9-5-rgb_front the other thing that you could use this for would be ciders maybe like a sparkling cider
4qhpu9fk5da_0-8-rgb_front so how much caffeine is in a flowering art tea
4qhpu9fk5da_1-8-rgb_front well flowering art tea the base which is this flower base that you see here that is made of all tea leaves though tea leaves used is mainly a white tea sometimes it is a green tea but mainly a white tea
4qhpu9fk5da_2-8-rgb_front if you brew it at room temperature there should be very very very little caffeine in it
4qhpu9fk5da_3-8-rgb_front but if you brew it at a higher temperature so that you can get the blossom to come to reveal itself sooner then you are going to bring a tea about that has a moderate amount of caffeine about milligrams of caffeine or so
4qhpu9fk5da_4-8-rgb_front another great thing about these flowering teas is they last about a week
4qhpu9fk5da_5-8-rgb_front all you have to do is throw out the old water and put in fresh room temperature water and let it sit and it will keep blossoming and blossoming
4qhpu9fk5da_6-8-rgb_front all you have to do is everyday or so you change out the water
4qhpu9fk5da_7-8-rgb_front if you choose to drink it which i do not recommend there should be no caffeine at all
4qhpu9fk5da_8-8-rgb_front one other thing about flowering tea is the flowers inside the tea has added health benefits
4rbzmudyjgc_0-5-rgb_front hi this is nigel gregory with blue griffin handyman
4rbzmudyjgc_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to show you how to use a hammer safely
4rbzmudyjgc_10-5-rgb_front watch your face when you come up
4rbzmudyjgc_11-5-rgb_front do not bring it up too high
4rbzmudyjgc_12-5-rgb_front but just lightly let the hammer fall
4rbzmudyjgc_13-5-rgb_front and that was how to use a hammer safely
4rbzmudyjgc_2-5-rgb_front now for most projects you probably do not want to use a hammer this big
4rbzmudyjgc_3-5-rgb_front but today we are just going to use this framing hammer
4rbzmudyjgc_4-5-rgb_front now when you use a hammer it is always important to wear your safety gear
4rbzmudyjgc_5-5-rgb_front good and sometimes even always help in a job
4rbzmudyjgc_6-5-rgb_front now to start you take your nail you take your hammer and to fasten two pieces of wood together you put your nail down and you hit the head of the nail just to secure it into the piece of wood
4rbzmudyjgc_7-5-rgb_front just lightly like that
4rbzmudyjgc_8-5-rgb_front once you have it standing by itself hold the two pieces of wood down and really let it go
4rbzmudyjgc_9-5-rgb_front do not grip the hammer too hard kind of loosely and use a good deal of momentum
4s2nxonwxvw_0-8-rgb_front amanda claire all right so already we have saved a lot of money
4s2nxonwxvw_1-8-rgb_front i mean the embroidery hoops are cheap this fabric like this can be you know sometimes cents a yard
4s2nxonwxvw_10-8-rgb_front you know have a few colors here yellow red white
4s2nxonwxvw_11-8-rgb_front you can even mix these colors if you want to kind of make your own colors
4s2nxonwxvw_12-8-rgb_front so these are your screen printing inks but just remember when you go shopping for inks you know get the colors you want and you know shop around a bit
4s2nxonwxvw_13-8-rgb_front you know buy these from a printing or craft supply store but remember you do need a different type of ink depending on what kind of printing your doing
4s2nxonwxvw_14-8-rgb_front so these actually say fabric inks on them fabric screen printing ink so these are good for printing
4s2nxonwxvw_15-8-rgb_front but if i was going to print posters or you know any kind of art print or i do not know greeting cards or something i would want to get a different kind of ink that is used for that
4s2nxonwxvw_2-8-rgb_front i mean that is about what i paid for this like cents a yard very very cheap stuff
4s2nxonwxvw_3-8-rgb_front and so we have already saved a lot of money with that
4s2nxonwxvw_4-8-rgb_front we do not have to buy any emulsion
4s2nxonwxvw_5-8-rgb_front one thing you really can not you know be miserly about you know something you really do kinda need to be spending some money on are the correct kinds of paint or ink for screen printing
4s2nxonwxvw_6-8-rgb_front and you do not want to just use any old paint or any old ink
4s2nxonwxvw_7-8-rgb_front you really want to kinda go to an art store or to a printing store and get the right stuff and so if you are going to be printing onto paper there is certain inks you would use for that
4s2nxonwxvw_8-8-rgb_front if you are going to be printing on the fabric there is certain inks that you would use for that
4s2nxonwxvw_9-8-rgb_front so i have some of them here some fabric screen printing ink these are by the speedball company but i am not endorsing them i am just saying that from the speedball company there is different companies that sell this stuff
4u57q4xifom_0-8-rgb_front one of the quickest ways to learn how to jump rope i will have a lot of new people come in and they will say i have not jumped rope since i was a kid or i have never jumped rope and i will see them over in the corner struggling with their jump roping
4u57q4xifom_1-8-rgb_front and other people come in and they already know how to jump rope and they are doing great and you know people are watching each other
4u57q4xifom_10-8-rgb_front and then at some point you can do the twice on one foot twice on the other and breath
4u57q4xifom_11-8-rgb_front but make sure your hands are not going into big circles ok
4u57q4xifom_12-8-rgb_front make sure your feet are not going way up and a good place to do this is actually in the mirror
4u57q4xifom_13-8-rgb_front once you do that for a two minute round in fact i have even had some of the kids doing them for three two minute rounds because you will actually get the same workout without the jump rope anyway but you look kind of foolish sometimes when the other boxers are looking at you and you do not have a jump rope and you are still jumping
4u57q4xifom_14-8-rgb_front but the best way to learn how to jump rope take the jump rope set it aside go through the motions
4u57q4xifom_15-8-rgb_front you can do it right in the mirror so you can see yourself
4u57q4xifom_16-8-rgb_front up and down try it i will bet you will be surprised
4u57q4xifom_2-8-rgb_front but with the people that are having trouble i tell them come on over here and bring your jump rope and then i say ok let me show you how to jump rope
4u57q4xifom_3-8-rgb_front so they hand me their jump rope and i take the jump rope and i say the best way and they think they are going to see me jump rope wrong
4u57q4xifom_4-8-rgb_front what i do is i take the jump rope and i say the first thing you do is you take your jump rope and you set it aside ok
4u57q4xifom_5-8-rgb_front just get rid of the jump rope completely for a minute
4u57q4xifom_6-8-rgb_front now what you are going to do is you are going to get in a position for jump roping and you are going to make believe you have a jump rope ok
4u57q4xifom_7-8-rgb_front so we are going to start hopping on the two feet and we are going to make our hands go down in that slow circle
4u57q4xifom_8-8-rgb_front as your hands go down your feet come up ok
4u57q4xifom_9-8-rgb_front and just make believe you have got a jump rope ok
4ukcwg0pk90_1-3-rgb_front now in this segment i am going to go over umbilical cord care
4ukcwg0pk90_10-3-rgb_front it will dry out a lot faster
4ukcwg0pk90_2-3-rgb_front now some doctors say to not touch the umbilical cord at all
4ukcwg0pk90_3-3-rgb_front some say just use plain water and a cotton swab
4ukcwg0pk90_4-3-rgb_front some say use a with either hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol
4ukcwg0pk90_5-3-rgb_front i personally use a cotton and rubbing alcohol
4ukcwg0pk90_6-3-rgb_front all i do is kind of dip it in there and then squeeze out the excess up against the inner part of the bottle at the top
4ukcwg0pk90_7-3-rgb_front you just take the and go around the umbilical cord
4ukcwg0pk90_8-3-rgb_front you can kind of go a little bit in between the umbilical cord and where the skin is and he does not have an umbilical cord anymore but let is just pretend
4ukcwg0pk90_9-3-rgb_front now when you are dressing your newborn you want to go ahead and if you do not have special newborn diapers go ahead and flip over the top so that the diapers are not rubbing up against the umbilical cord and it is actually better if you just dress the baby in just diapers and a so that they do not have something like over that area
4ulmdzi98fk_0-5-rgb_front if you have had a computer for a while you have probably noticed it slowing down
4ulmdzi98fk_1-5-rgb_front hi i am charles stewart jr and i am going to tell you how to make your computer faster
4ulmdzi98fk_10-5-rgb_front so you will want to go in and delete cookies or go into your disk clean up utility and run that and it will clean up delete files that you do not need anymore
4ulmdzi98fk_11-5-rgb_front or just go in if you know you are not using folders or even programs go in and delete those and clear that off of there
4ulmdzi98fk_12-5-rgb_front especially stuff you are not using anymore
4ulmdzi98fk_13-5-rgb_front the next thing would be to upgrade your ram
4ulmdzi98fk_14-5-rgb_front that is usually one of the cheapest and easiest things to do and you will see a significant speed increase in your computer
4ulmdzi98fk_15-5-rgb_front because a lot of people do not realize that ram does play a big part in the speed of your computer
4ulmdzi98fk_16-5-rgb_front so obviously if you are buying a computer you do not want to skimp on the ram
4ulmdzi98fk_17-5-rgb_front definitely get as much of that as you can afford
4ulmdzi98fk_18-5-rgb_front and if you have had your computer for a while you can probably find ram pretty cheap on the internet
4ulmdzi98fk_19-5-rgb_front so that is definitely another thing you can do
4ulmdzi98fk_2-5-rgb_front one of the first things you can do just without buying anything is just to check and see your hard drive
4ulmdzi98fk_20-5-rgb_front and pretty much the last thing to do is if you want to kind of keep as much stuff off off the hard drive that your operating system runs on
4ulmdzi98fk_21-5-rgb_front so maybe buying an external hard drive to keep your music and movies and whatever your personal files on that
4ulmdzi98fk_22-5-rgb_front or maybe buying another internal drive and installing it in your computer and keep that stuff on there which also helps as a safe guard in case that computer crashes one day you do not lose all that data you can take it to another computer
4ulmdzi98fk_23-5-rgb_front and those are just a few things to keep your computer running or make it run faster
4ulmdzi98fk_3-5-rgb_front make sure it is not too full
4ulmdzi98fk_4-5-rgb_front the best way to do that is go to my computer and then click on your hard drive and it will tell you right there what size it is and how much free space you have left
4ulmdzi98fk_5-5-rgb_front if you do not have a lot of free space left then that is probably a big thing that is slowing down your computer right there
4ulmdzi98fk_6-5-rgb_front because files are stored all over the place on a hard drive
4ulmdzi98fk_7-5-rgb_front it is not nice and neat like you would think sometimes
4ulmdzi98fk_8-5-rgb_front so the more stuff you have on there and especially the bigger the hard drive is the longer the computer has to take to find those files so with just everyday tasks
4ulmdzi98fk_9-5-rgb_front so it definitely will slow down your computer
4woq5pl24_k_1-5-rgb_front okay this one i am going to make sure i use steel chopsticks
4woq5pl24_k_2-5-rgb_front either is fine but it is a little variation so opponent grabs from behind
4woq5pl24_k_3-5-rgb_front usually when you grab something else is coming it could be a knife a bottle or a punch
4woq5pl24_k_4-5-rgb_front so as i grab i have to shift my body position alright and i strike lower spot
4woq5pl24_k_5-5-rgb_front then i shift around using the chopsticks facing down then back and
4woq5pl24_k_6-5-rgb_front now real time
4xaetaoxaa0_0-5-rgb_front hi
4xaetaoxaa0_2-5-rgb_front can you apply mascara to your lash extensions
4xaetaoxaa0_3-5-rgb_front you may apply mascara but never waterproof mascara
4xaetaoxaa0_4-5-rgb_front novalash offers a mascara formulated especially for lash extensions
4xaetaoxaa0_5-5-rgb_front you may use your own mascara
4xaetaoxaa0_6-5-rgb_front however if used everyday certain ingredients in that mascara may help break down the adhesive bond
4xaetaoxaa0_7-5-rgb_front i actually would not recommend using mascara at all as it is not needed
4xaetaoxaa0_8-5-rgb_front the adhesive is already black as well as the synthetic lashes
4xaetaoxaa0_9-5-rgb_front the lashes are not only black but also thick in diameter creating thick black lashes about the use of mascara
4yrehzfsldy_0-5-rgb_front hi this is dow here at the firehouse detail shop today we are detailing the exterior of a car segment by segment teaching you how to do it like a professional
4yrehzfsldy_1-5-rgb_front we are to that stage right now where we want to talk about the all important waxing of the vehicle
4yrehzfsldy_10-5-rgb_front talk to your detail specialist
4yrehzfsldy_11-5-rgb_front where we see a lot of cars and do a lot of waxes on a day to day basis we have been very happy with this wax protectant we are about to use and then the question is how you are going to apply it to the car
4yrehzfsldy_12-5-rgb_front in a high end detail you do not you want to be careful not to get it on the trim because the waxes and the silicones can actually discolor and maybe leave a white residue on the black trim
4yrehzfsldy_13-5-rgb_front so be cautious the way you do that
4yrehzfsldy_14-5-rgb_front you might even want to mask it off with tape or cover it
4yrehzfsldy_15-5-rgb_front a couple methods if you are going to do it by hand you can always use an applicator pad and simply put the wax on it and start you know start applying the wax to the car
4yrehzfsldy_16_17-5-rgb_front small little swirls is ok you want to go back and forth not we are not doing it like they did in the wax on wax off
4yrehzfsldy_18-5-rgb_front you actually want to apply the wax back and forth in the way that the air flows over
4yrehzfsldy_19-5-rgb_front so small swirls that is kind of that is for hollywood
4yrehzfsldy_2-5-rgb_front of course the cars has got to be clean
4yrehzfsldy_20-5-rgb_front for a professional detailer you want to go back and forth the way air flows over the car ok
4yrehzfsldy_21-5-rgb_front now we actually use an orbital buffer
4yrehzfsldy_22-5-rgb_front it is located right here
4yrehzfsldy_23-5-rgb_front this orbital buffer we simply apply some we get it spinning add a little product to it and you will go back and forth across the car like we talked about in the direction that air flows
4yrehzfsldy_24-5-rgb_front what that does is it is using small vibrations movement and it works the wax into the paint a little better than we can by hand and it allows us to move a little faster over the car without compromising the quality
4yrehzfsldy_25-5-rgb_front we can wax a car in a hand wax express you know in about ten minutes a vehicle this size by utilizing these tools
4yrehzfsldy_26-5-rgb_front this one is run by air there is also electric hand orbitals
4yrehzfsldy_27-5-rgb_front they are inexpensive you can get them from your professional detail supply shop and they do a great job of applying the wax
4yrehzfsldy_28-5-rgb_front now we have got it on we will often work our way around the entire vehicle give the time for the wax to be on there to bond and then we just simply get a microfiber towel come in again same direction back to front remove the wax changing the towel and flipping it on a regular basis so you are wiping the car with a clean portion
4yrehzfsldy_3-5-rgb_front if it had any kind of industrial fall out we want to have all of that removed with the clay which we talked about in an earlier segment
4yrehzfsldy_4-5-rgb_front we are staring now kind of the pure paint scratches have been removed oxidation one of the hardest things here is selecting the right product because there is so many available on the market
4yrehzfsldy_5-5-rgb_front there is waxes with polymers there is paint protections which are more expensive but which bond to the paint and actually will give you extended protection
4yrehzfsldy_6-5-rgb_front we use a wax protectant that we are confident lasts ninety to one hundred and twenty days
4yrehzfsldy_7-5-rgb_front it bonds it uses a combination of polymers and other things
4yrehzfsldy_8-5-rgb_front you of course we have heard of the carnauba waxes which are from a tree they are organic they do a wonderful job at shining up the car they just do not have the lasting properties
4yrehzfsldy_9-5-rgb_front so find the wax that best suits you
52mbwpfvuf0_1-8-rgb_front today we are making pumpkin spice cupcakes with vanilla bean cream cheese icing
52mbwpfvuf0_10-8-rgb_front you want it to be level because if you have more flour your cupcake will be dry so this gives you an accurate measurement
52mbwpfvuf0_11-8-rgb_front baking is really a science it makes a big difference if you have a teaspoon extra of flour or any other ingredient or to lessen one ingredient or too little of one ingredient
52mbwpfvuf0_12-8-rgb_front i am also going to put another cup of flour in here so it is a total of and cup of flour
52mbwpfvuf0_13-8-rgb_front now since i do not have a cup measuring i am just going to eyeball it and that is of a cup
52mbwpfvuf0_14-8-rgb_front as you can see there is quite a bit left over here
52mbwpfvuf0_15-8-rgb_front i originally scooped up cups of flour from the sack and there is probably another cup left in here so had i measured it right out of the sack i would have a very dry cupcake
52mbwpfvuf0_16-8-rgb_front let is just put the bowl aside here and add the other dry ingredients
52mbwpfvuf0_17-8-rgb_front first you are going to add one half teaspoon of baking soda and one half teaspoon of baking powder and one teaspoon of salt
52mbwpfvuf0_18-8-rgb_front we want to make sure that all of the salt baking powder and baking soda is really incorporated into the flour so that someone does not get just one bite of baking soda
52mbwpfvuf0_19-8-rgb_front you can imagine how horrible that could be
52mbwpfvuf0_2-8-rgb_front we are going to start by mixing the dry ingredients
52mbwpfvuf0_20-8-rgb_front now we are going to add our raisins and our walnuts and this is a little trick that we use at the bakery is to add the raisins and the walnuts instead of at the end is to add them with the flour mixture because then they get coated with a little bit of the flour mixture and it prevents them from sinking to the bottom of the cupcakes
52mbwpfvuf0_21-8-rgb_front let is see how that is all incorporated there
52mbwpfvuf0_3-8-rgb_front we will start off by using all purpose flour
52mbwpfvuf0_4-8-rgb_front i like to sift my flour before i even measure it
52mbwpfvuf0_5-8-rgb_front if you do not sift it first you will have an inaccurate measurement
52mbwpfvuf0_6-8-rgb_front usually the flour gets compacted and you can see it when it has been sitting in the bag so it is always nice to just sift it in a big sifter over a bowl and then measure
52mbwpfvuf0_7-8-rgb_front there we go
52mbwpfvuf0_8-8-rgb_front now my flour is nice and light
52mbwpfvuf0_9-8-rgb_front i am going to be measure and cup and the way i measure is by just scooping into the measuring cup
53azmnnfcpq_1-5-rgb_front we are going to tell you how to make biodiesel from all the different types of oils that are out there
53azmnnfcpq_10-5-rgb_front all of these things i can make biodiesel out of
53azmnnfcpq_11-5-rgb_front it is very easy to do
53azmnnfcpq_12-5-rgb_front all i have to have is an organic oil to do it
53azmnnfcpq_13-5-rgb_front i am going to show you how to do it a little bit later here
53azmnnfcpq_14-5-rgb_front but i wanted to show you that you can actually make biodiesel from all sorts of different oils
53azmnnfcpq_15-5-rgb_front any kind of organic oil
53azmnnfcpq_16-5-rgb_front this is macadamia nut oil
53azmnnfcpq_17-5-rgb_front this is soy bean oil biodiesel
53azmnnfcpq_18-5-rgb_front so these are biodiesels that we have made
53azmnnfcpq_19-5-rgb_front this is olive oil based biodiesel
53azmnnfcpq_2-5-rgb_front biodiesel can be made from all sorts of different things
53azmnnfcpq_20-5-rgb_front this is another macadamia nut
53azmnnfcpq_21-5-rgb_front this is waste vegetable oil
53azmnnfcpq_22-5-rgb_front this one is corn oil
53azmnnfcpq_23-5-rgb_front and this one is hemp seed oil
53azmnnfcpq_3-5-rgb_front we have just settled our oil
53azmnnfcpq_4-5-rgb_front i am going to take my goggles off here and get back down to talking about how we make biodiesel
53azmnnfcpq_5-5-rgb_front first of all this is canola oil
53azmnnfcpq_6-5-rgb_front i just picked it up at a local grocery store
53azmnnfcpq_7-5-rgb_front this is vegetable oil
53azmnnfcpq_8-5-rgb_front it is actually soy bean oil if you look on the back the most common thing in the united states
53azmnnfcpq_9-5-rgb_front this is corn oil and believe it or not this is oil that came from french fries that were fried
54erx_j7pge_0-5-rgb_front alright there are basically two types of toilets
54erx_j7pge_1-5-rgb_front the toilet with the tank on it that we all know and love and then the lowboy or often called a tankless toilet
54erx_j7pge_10-5-rgb_front giving us and with the toilet seat putting it up to darn near the same height as a regular chair in the house
54erx_j7pge_11-5-rgb_front so getting on and off the toilet is much more comfortable with the new toilets
54erx_j7pge_12-5-rgb_front and we are just going to discuss how to repair this toilet
54erx_j7pge_2-5-rgb_front here is a case ii common in the detroit area
54erx_j7pge_3-5-rgb_front it is a one piece toilet and there is a tank built in on it but it is all one big piece of china
54erx_j7pge_4-5-rgb_front the lid and the seat are separate but the toilet is one piece it is got a standard flushing mechanism but the flush valve that fills this is very complicated
54erx_j7pge_5-5-rgb_front we are not going to go into that today
54erx_j7pge_6-5-rgb_front now the one thing we can say about the tank all toilets actually is that this particular one is an elongated bowl
54erx_j7pge_7-5-rgb_front it is a little bit longer a little bit more comfortable for larger men
54erx_j7pge_8-5-rgb_front this and this toilet is only fifteen inches tall the old standard height of a toilet
54erx_j7pge_9-5-rgb_front now with us aging baby boomers coming along our toilets now are seventeen inches high
54xxeg5cy-0_0-5-rgb_front this is the basics of massage etiquette sensitivity to the client is mood
54xxeg5cy-0_1-5-rgb_front when you are seeing clients day in and day out regardless of the time of day or the day of the week everybody is leading their own life and you are never quite certain what a client may have just come from or what their mood may be in
54xxeg5cy-0_2-5-rgb_front whether it is the mood they woke up with that morning or something that is transpired at the office before they came to see you or something that occurred to them in the parking lot of your establishment as they are on their way in
54xxeg5cy-0_3-5-rgb_front it is for this reason that being sensitive to being aware of the client is mood and being responsive to the client is mood is an essential part of making the entire therapeutic session more successful
54xxeg5cy-0_4-5-rgb_front obviously if you have got an established client that you have a rapport with the type of thing that you can ask the client about you can probably go a long way towards resolving whatever the mood issue might be or at least becoming more aware of it so that you can work your own actions during the therapy session into the context of whatever that person is mood is
54xxeg5cy-0_5-5-rgb_front with a client that you are less familiar with do your best to understand what it is they are dealing with and where they are coming from and again work that therapeutically into the therapy session
54xxeg5cy-0_6-5-rgb_front and this is the basics of massage etiquette client mood
55biths7kyc_0-3-rgb_front hi
55biths7kyc_10-3-rgb_front in next segment we are going to discuss setting the water level on your washing machine itself
55biths7kyc_2-3-rgb_front i am here showing you how to wash your jeans
55biths7kyc_3-3-rgb_front right now i will tell you how to load the washing machine
55biths7kyc_4-3-rgb_front you want to go ahead and add your detergent to the washing machine first
55biths7kyc_5-3-rgb_front you always want to put your detergent in first then go ahead and put your jeans in
55biths7kyc_6-3-rgb_front be careful not to stuff them into the washing machine
55biths7kyc_7-3-rgb_front you need a little bit of space between things in order for the stuff to get through the water and the soap to really get in there and wash it
55biths7kyc_8-3-rgb_front it is never a good idea to stuff your clothes in the washing machine
55biths7kyc_9-3-rgb_front that covers loading your washing machine
55ir3rxwuta_0-8-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson
55ir3rxwuta_1-8-rgb_front right now we are talking about how to play good defense and what your responsibilities are in the defense
55ir3rxwuta_10-8-rgb_front and we want him to take his hands and point man ball
55ir3rxwuta_11-8-rgb_front and this way when the ball skips back he can quickly close to his man or if the ball goes back here he could go back into deny
55ir3rxwuta_12-8-rgb_front but in this position we call this help side defense
55ir3rxwuta_13-8-rgb_front now he can help if this guy drives or he can help if the ball comes from the opposite wing
55ir3rxwuta_14-8-rgb_front so we have got on the ball we have got deny and now we have talked about help side defense
55ir3rxwuta_2-8-rgb_front first of all we have seen that when the ball is at the man that you are assigned then you are going to be in or on the ball defense
55ir3rxwuta_3-8-rgb_front so right now his man has the ball so kyle is going to be on the ball in defense
55ir3rxwuta_4-8-rgb_front so go ahead and get in a good defensive stance
55ir3rxwuta_5-8-rgb_front now as the ball moves his assignments are going to change
55ir3rxwuta_6-8-rgb_front one pass away we know that he is now in deny
55ir3rxwuta_7-8-rgb_front what we want to focus on in this clip is something called help side defense
55ir3rxwuta_8-8-rgb_front if he is not on the ball and if he is not one pass away he does not have to worry about that man passing the ball back as the ball moves to the next guy he no longer has to be concerned necessarily about what the ball is going to do with his man
55ir3rxwuta_9-8-rgb_front instead what he is going to do now is he is going drop off to where he can look outside and he can see both his man and the ball
57_1t6o51tq_0-8-rgb_front ninety percent of the people who develop diabetes develop type two diabetes
57_1t6o51tq_1-8-rgb_front type two diabetes is characterized by high blood sugars
57_1t6o51tq_10-8-rgb_front but the third and fourth reason are probably the most important
57_1t6o51tq_11-8-rgb_front because we have an epidemic of diabetes in this country and it is very much related to the epidemic of obesity
57_1t6o51tq_12-8-rgb_front and so the third and fourth reason are overweight and not moving enough
57_1t6o51tq_13-8-rgb_front and so those are the four reasons why someone might develop type two diabetes
57_1t6o51tq_14-8-rgb_front now when someone does develop type two diabetes they generally notice they are feeling very tired less energy sleepy a lot
57_1t6o51tq_15-8-rgb_front those are probably the overriding symptoms when you first develop type two diabetes
57_1t6o51tq_16-8-rgb_front and the reason is because when the blood sugar is high in the bloodstream it effects the nervous system and makes you feel kind of like you have taken a tranquilizer
57_1t6o51tq_2-8-rgb_front generally not quite as high as type one during diagnoses
57_1t6o51tq_3-8-rgb_front but high enough that we can say the person has diabetes
57_1t6o51tq_4-8-rgb_front it comes on because of four major factors
57_1t6o51tq_5-8-rgb_front number one is genetics
57_1t6o51tq_6-8-rgb_front most people who have type two diabetes have a family history of problems with maintaining normal blood sugars
57_1t6o51tq_7-8-rgb_front the second is age
57_1t6o51tq_8-8-rgb_front no one gets to age ninety with perfect what we call cell receptor function in terms of insulin
57_1t6o51tq_9-8-rgb_front and so there is a decrease in our ability to use insulin effectively as we get older
57bbrjn0xec_0-1-rgb_front hello i am kyle brayer and your next tricep exercise will be the tricep drop set
57bbrjn0xec_1-1-rgb_front this can be performed standing or seated in a kitchen chair or bench
57bbrjn0xec_10-1-rgb_front she is going to bring that weight up and over her head back down to her thighs safely
57bbrjn0xec_11-1-rgb_front okay karie here you go and i will trade you with the medicine ball
57bbrjn0xec_12-1-rgb_front so she is going from lbs
57bbrjn0xec_13-1-rgb_front to lbs and now she is going to perform the same exercise up and over her head
57bbrjn0xec_14-1-rgb_front she is going to do the same thing until she fatigues
57bbrjn0xec_15-1-rgb_front so she is really working the triceps right now and since we are doing so many repetitions and we are dropping the weight we are adding a lot of blood and amino acids into those muscles that will help fatigue them
57bbrjn0xec_16-1-rgb_front there you go karie and then last we will give her a lb
57bbrjn0xec_17-1-rgb_front medicine ball
57bbrjn0xec_18-1-rgb_front so as you start out different weights is a good way to start
57bbrjn0xec_19-1-rgb_front as you progress you can actually from the gym start at like the and work your way all the way down to the lb
57bbrjn0xec_20-1-rgb_front dumbbells
57bbrjn0xec_21-1-rgb_front as you get more advanced you can play with the weights and start heavier start lighter
57bbrjn0xec_22-1-rgb_front the idea is when she is done with these she will almost reach failure so she will be pressing until she can no longer press the weight anymore
57bbrjn0xec_23-1-rgb_front that is good
57bbrjn0xec_24-1-rgb_front so this an overhead tricep drop set
57bbrjn0xec_2_3_4-1-rgb_front karie is going to start with a lb dumbbell here she is going to pick it up over her head just as she did on the overhead tricep extensions
57bbrjn0xec_5-1-rgb_front the exercise here is to fatigue the triceps so the idea is to get as many repetitions as possible
57bbrjn0xec_6-1-rgb_front so karie will start with these lbs keeping perfect form she is going to go up and over her head
57bbrjn0xec_7_8-1-rgb_front as she starts to fatigue as she starts to get tired we are going to be looking at this lb medicine ball
57bbrjn0xec_9-1-rgb_front so let is say that she does or repetitions and she starts to fatigue
58xx_6ashzq_0-5-rgb_front do you ever find yourself looking for different ways to entertain yourself
58xx_6ashzq_1-5-rgb_front hi my name is dean hale i am going to tell you a little bit about how to play dice
58xx_6ashzq_10-5-rgb_front it is the top number how you count the dice you would not look at anything from the sides it would actually be the top
58xx_6ashzq_11-5-rgb_front most people understand that but just to make sure you are counting the top dice
58xx_6ashzq_12-5-rgb_front when you roll your dice you have to take them in your hand and move them around so everybody knows you are not just putting down a number and turning it over
58xx_6ashzq_13-5-rgb_front so you would roll your dice shake them in your hand and then roll them and whatever the number came up with or whatever game you were playing that is how it would be used
58xx_6ashzq_14-5-rgb_front now you can be created when you are playing dice
58xx_6ashzq_15-5-rgb_front you can come up with any kind of different games
58xx_6ashzq_16-5-rgb_front you can do something with your children help them learn how to count you could say roll the dice and ask your daughter what is two plus two
58xx_6ashzq_17-5-rgb_front you could have her say four and an easy way is have her count the pips on the dice and that could be a fun way to do some learning at home
58xx_6ashzq_18-5-rgb_front there is many different things you can do with dice i suggest you go out there use your imagination and have a good time
58xx_6ashzq_19-5-rgb_front my name is dean hale and i have just taught you how to play dice
58xx_6ashzq_2-5-rgb_front dice is a pretty old game and it is been played throughout the ages
58xx_6ashzq_3-5-rgb_front you can play it in many different forms and fashions sometimes you use the dice to play board games sometimes you use it at casinos to play what they call craps
58xx_6ashzq_4-5-rgb_front you could use the dice in various fashions six could actually be a six
58xx_6ashzq_5-5-rgb_front it could also correspond to something on a board or the game you are playing that may mean something else
58xx_6ashzq_6-5-rgb_front you could the numbers and if you are trying to make a poker hand for example you could have the one count as an ace
58xx_6ashzq_7-5-rgb_front a two as a two you could try to make straights you could try to make full houses a full house is something where you have let is say two sixes along with three fives
58xx_6ashzq_8-5-rgb_front that would be fives over sixes and you could have that with dice also
58xx_6ashzq_9-5-rgb_front dice are typically square shaped six sided and as you roll them they will come out and the numbers will come out on the top
59xx5jtruk4_0-8-rgb_front in this clip i will keep introducing to you other steps of the dance ruchenitza
59xx5jtruk4_1-8-rgb_front the one which is called scissoring
59xx5jtruk4_10-8-rgb_front one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three
59xx5jtruk4_11-8-rgb_front now we will combine the basic movement the cross step and the scissoring
59xx5jtruk4_12-8-rgb_front one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three
59xx5jtruk4_2-8-rgb_front the legs are moving forward sliding with the same count
59xx5jtruk4_3-8-rgb_front three one two three one two three one two three one two three
59xx5jtruk4_4-8-rgb_front we can walk forward or in place or backwards
59xx5jtruk4_5-8-rgb_front we can move sideways
59xx5jtruk4_6-8-rgb_front three one two three
59xx5jtruk4_7-8-rgb_front but always keep the bouncing
59xx5jtruk4_8-8-rgb_front two three one two three one two three
59xx5jtruk4_9-8-rgb_front the tempo goes different
5alpcmsphx4_0-8-rgb_front hi i am hunter from the austin aqua dome
5alpcmsphx4_1-8-rgb_front changing some of the water in your aquarium is an important task that should be done at least monthly to
5alpcmsphx4_2-8-rgb_front after you have drained a half of the water out of the tank with your siphon hose you want to use a good brand of dechlorinator that takes out both chlorine and chloramines
5alpcmsphx4_3-8-rgb_front add the recommended of drops per gallon and then fill the tank back up with tap water
5alpcmsphx4_4-8-rgb_front for salt water tanks you want to have a bucket or a trash can that you use just for the purpose of mixing up new salt water
5alpcmsphx4_5-8-rgb_front get the water in the bucket to the concentration and salinity of the water that is in the tank
5alpcmsphx4_6-8-rgb_front after you drained the salt water down refill it with the water that you have mixed up in the bucket
5alpcmsphx4_7-8-rgb_front either way it is a good idea to test the water that you are adding in to make sure that it is about the same temperature of the water that is in the tank
5cgdj5cuv5m_0-8-rgb_front do you like to play board games
5cgdj5cuv5m_1-8-rgb_front hi my name is dean hale and i am going to teach you how to get out of jail in monopoly
5cgdj5cuv5m_10-8-rgb_front so you would take the dice and you would just simply roll them if you did not get a double on your first roll you would wait until your turn comes around again you would pick them up and you would throw again
5cgdj5cuv5m_11-8-rgb_front you get two more tries actually one more try to roll a double and then you can get out of jail
5cgdj5cuv5m_12-8-rgb_front if not on the third try after you do that you would get out the time after that
5cgdj5cuv5m_13-8-rgb_front getting out of jail is important because you want to be able to buy a property or maybe you are running low on money and you do not want to land on somebody is property that is right after the jail so you might want to stay in jail for a while
5cgdj5cuv5m_14-8-rgb_front rolling the dice might be the best way to do that
5cgdj5cuv5m_15-8-rgb_front see if i am in i am out of jail two sixes
5cgdj5cuv5m_16-8-rgb_front my name is dean hale have fun playing monopoly
5cgdj5cuv5m_2-8-rgb_front getting in to jail happens when you roll a two of a kind three times
5cgdj5cuv5m_3-8-rgb_front how do you get out
5cgdj5cuv5m_4-8-rgb_front there is three ways to do that
5cgdj5cuv5m_5-8-rgb_front you can pay money you can roll three times or you can simply roll a double
5cgdj5cuv5m_6-8-rgb_front that is rolling two sixes two fives and so on
5cgdj5cuv5m_7-8-rgb_front why is it important to get out of jail
5cgdj5cuv5m_8-8-rgb_front well you do not want to be in jail while other people are buying up property and making all the money
5cgdj5cuv5m_9-8-rgb_front you want to get out of jail so you can start playing monopoly yourself
5geycf-gr_k_0-5-rgb_front now that i have used my wooden spoon and i have pressed over all the surface that i want to print i am going to take a peek
5geycf-gr_k_1-5-rgb_front just by keeping my hand on the print i am going to pull it back to see how it is going and i can see that i am getting a pretty good impression
5geycf-gr_k_2-5-rgb_front so i am going to pull my print off and here we have my image
5geycf-gr_k_3-5-rgb_front now here we can see one of the most important things about print making to remember is that it is a mirror image
5geycf-gr_k_4-5-rgb_front my block of wood next to my print gives you a really clear idea of that mirror image and in this print in particular since there is text although it is in italian you can see how carving it in the mirror image is going to be very important for its final
5geycf-gr_k_5-5-rgb_front because this paper is very fibrous you can see the fibers it is picking up all of those details
5geycf-gr_k_6-5-rgb_front these are elements that you can use to help enhance your print
5geycf-gr_k_7-5-rgb_front if you want a more clean line then you are going to want to use a paper that has less fibers and is and is has a more clean surface
5geycf-gr_k_8-5-rgb_front in this particular piece of paper it is very textured and it is transferring that texture into my print
5gf2d_laus4_0-8-rgb_front o k
5gf2d_laus4_1-8-rgb_front now one thing to keep in mind here is if you wanted to go just with gold fish you would not need the heater o k
5gf2d_laus4_10-8-rgb_front and as you can see they are kind of spread out here so they are using the plants
5gf2d_laus4_11-8-rgb_front and and of course you re your tropical fish pet person will help you with that too
5gf2d_laus4_12-8-rgb_front as far as selection of fish that is where you might want to again rely on the your pet shop expert
5gf2d_laus4_13-8-rgb_front obviously you are going to want some some color but just because a fish is colorful does not mean you can mix them obviously you can not mix piranha with tetras
5gf2d_laus4_14-8-rgb_front if you are going to go with piranha with is a carnivorous fish you are going to want to stay with only piranhas
5gf2d_laus4_15-8-rgb_front there is a lot of basic community fish molly is sword tails guppies neons these are small colorful fish that get along well with each other and do fine in a tank together
5gf2d_laus4_16-8-rgb_front for the more serious hobbyist you might want to go with cichlids if you go with cichlids you have got to stay with only cichlids
5gf2d_laus4_17-8-rgb_front you can not mix cichlids with gold fish or cichlids with these these community type of tropical fish
5gf2d_laus4_18-8-rgb_front if you go with south african cichlids you want to stay with south african you do not want to mix them with south american cichlids
5gf2d_laus4_19-8-rgb_front the the the african cichlids are a more aggressive fish
5gf2d_laus4_2-8-rgb_front those are gold fish are cold water fish their very basically glorified carp and you could you would not want a heater
5gf2d_laus4_20-8-rgb_front these are the kind of things that you should talk to your pet shop tropical fish expert about he will know these things
5gf2d_laus4_21-8-rgb_front and you can go from
5gf2d_laus4_3-8-rgb_front however if you go with tropical fish you are going to want to be a little more careful because they re not as durable as gold fish
5gf2d_laus4_4-8-rgb_front now as far as number of fish to go with a good rule of thumb is one one inch of fish per gallon
5gf2d_laus4_5-8-rgb_front so in other words in a in a in a tank that is a ten gallon tank like this about ten inches of fish
5gf2d_laus4_6-8-rgb_front you can break that down you know ten one inch fish or or five two inch fish
5gf2d_laus4_7-8-rgb_front now obviously if you get a ten inch fish yeah he could live in here but you get to a ten inch fish oscar something like that you are going to want to go with a bigger tank cause that is not going to be really fair to the fish to go with a ten inch fish in this this this small of a tank would not be fair to to the fish and you would not enjoy it either
5gf2d_laus4_8-8-rgb_front so so that is what we are looking at here as far as fish
5gf2d_laus4_9-8-rgb_front obviously if you get a much bigger filter you could probably fit more more fish in there but for for what we are doing here basic small appropriate filter bout bout ten inches of fish in this tank
5ghcxlncguq_0-5-rgb_front the last thing i want to touch on and i like to touch on this with any reptile is listening to your reptile
5ghcxlncguq_1-5-rgb_front i know he is not talking to me
5ghcxlncguq_10-5-rgb_front so if he is acting a little bit listless or if he is not necessarily as active as he should be or if he is spending too much time in one area of the enclosure we need to take a critical eye to why that this is happening
5ghcxlncguq_11-5-rgb_front it is very important that we very carefully observe him in his captive environment because you are essentially his god
5ghcxlncguq_12-5-rgb_front you have control over everything and you have to make sure that you are doing the right thing for him
5ghcxlncguq_13-5-rgb_front he is your responsibility
5ghcxlncguq_14-5-rgb_front it is just like having a child
5ghcxlncguq_15-5-rgb_front so make sure you are listening to your reptile as it is part of the fun of keeping a reptile as well as important for his overall health and care
5ghcxlncguq_2-5-rgb_front i can not hear him
5ghcxlncguq_3-5-rgb_front he does not speak but he does talk to me in other ways
5ghcxlncguq_4-5-rgb_front he talks to me in his behavior
5ghcxlncguq_5-5-rgb_front he talks to me in how he moves what he does on a daily basis
5ghcxlncguq_6-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that you are spending the time to watch this animal in his enclosure as well as outside of the enclosure in your hand on a daily basis
5ghcxlncguq_7-5-rgb_front and just kind of check out to see what he is doing
5ghcxlncguq_8-5-rgb_front if he is doing any one thing particular that seems out of the ordinary make sure you look into that
5ghcxlncguq_9-5-rgb_front these behavioral cues can be important in identifying problems in husbandry before they become life threatening for the animal
5hdllzeloeg_1-8-rgb_front there are quite a few different ways to make a key but there are only a couple basically that locksmiths are usually commonly
5hdllzeloeg_10-8-rgb_front this machine actually traces the existing key and makes your new one
5hdllzeloeg_11-8-rgb_front so what you do is insert your existing key in and make sure it is tight up against the stops lock it down we have got our new key in already and you just turn the machine on
5hdllzeloeg_12-8-rgb_front now this is a fully manual machine
5hdllzeloeg_13-8-rgb_front they actually have a automatic version that you can buy
5hdllzeloeg_14-8-rgb_front i prefer to have the control of full manualism
5hdllzeloeg_15-8-rgb_front once you have got the first cut you back trace it so you do not miss anything and pop your key out do a quick little cleaning on the airbrush there and voila you have an exact duplicate of your original key
5hdllzeloeg_2-8-rgb_front the first one we are going to cover is going to be the code machine
5hdllzeloeg_3-8-rgb_front this is what they call a punch down machine
5hdllzeloeg_4-8-rgb_front it is a real simple system
5hdllzeloeg_5-8-rgb_front you insert your key there
5hdllzeloeg_6-8-rgb_front you set your code on the bar now and in this case the key we are cutting are going to be all is so i will not have to change anything
5hdllzeloeg_7-8-rgb_front you just punch it down
5hdllzeloeg_8-8-rgb_front each time you punch it down it is cutting a notch in the key and that is giving you your actual key code and here you can see it is is all the way across
5hdllzeloeg_9-8-rgb_front the second more common way of cutting a key is just a standard duplicating machine
5l334ojnp7w_0-5-rgb_front hi
5l334ojnp7w_1-5-rgb_front i am michael seto professional photographer and in this clip we are going to talk about selecting and using a tripod for jewelry photography
5l334ojnp7w_10-5-rgb_front it is a nice sturdy tripod
5l334ojnp7w_11-5-rgb_front it is something that a lot of professionals use
5l334ojnp7w_12-5-rgb_front as well instead of just the standard head on this this is more of a video head i use a ball head
5l334ojnp7w_13-5-rgb_front this one is made by really right stuff
5l334ojnp7w_14-5-rgb_front they make some fantastic very high quality ball heads probably the cadillac of ball heads and you really need one of these to to be able to take a good shot of a piece of jewelry
5l334ojnp7w_15-5-rgb_front so tripod is important a nice tripod with the good head is a key to a stable camera when doing jewelry photography
5l334ojnp7w_2-5-rgb_front first of all when you are shooting jewelry which is a macro type situation meaning you are shooting up close you absolutely need a tripod
5l334ojnp7w_3-5-rgb_front there is no way you are going to be able to shoot something like that and get a very clear and sharp photo without using a tripod just because you are very close to the subject any movement will be magnified in the photograph
5l334ojnp7w_4-5-rgb_front as well you tend to shoot with a slower shutter speed so that also exacerbates any movement
5l334ojnp7w_5-5-rgb_front so let is look at a couple of tripods here
5l334ojnp7w_6-5-rgb_front you can go with a very basic small travel tripod these are fairly economical
5l334ojnp7w_7-5-rgb_front they come with a little quick detach mechanism that fits on the bottom of your camera
5l334ojnp7w_8-5-rgb_front these will do the job in a pinch but they are fairly light weight they will not be as stable as a more tripod like this one
5l334ojnp7w_9-5-rgb_front this is a manfrotto
5lh23uuvx2m_0-8-rgb_front do you play spades
5lh23uuvx2m_1-8-rgb_front do you want to learn some different ways to play spades
5lh23uuvx2m_10-8-rgb_front if you get a successful nil bid that is worth a hundred points
5lh23uuvx2m_11-8-rgb_front an unsuccessful nil bid is worth negative one hundred points
5lh23uuvx2m_12-8-rgb_front each time you get your trick you are going to be ten if you called four it is ten times four
5lh23uuvx2m_13-8-rgb_front you are going to get forty points
5lh23uuvx2m_14-8-rgb_front if you do not make it you are going to get points deducted
5lh23uuvx2m_15-8-rgb_front so in suicide spades the thing is you are going to be having a nil bid in the hand each time which is obviously going to put a lot of pressure on both teams
5lh23uuvx2m_16-8-rgb_front you are going to play to an agreed upon score and the first team to get that score wins
5lh23uuvx2m_17-8-rgb_front my name is dean hale
5lh23uuvx2m_18-8-rgb_front enjoy your new form of spades suicide spades
5lh23uuvx2m_2-8-rgb_front hi my name is dean hale and i am going to teach you a game called suicide spades
5lh23uuvx2m_3-8-rgb_front the cards are dealt out in the same fashion as a normal spades game would be thirteen cards for each player
5lh23uuvx2m_4-8-rgb_front the difference in this game is you have to bid either nil or at least four tricks
5lh23uuvx2m_5-8-rgb_front the first person the first partnership would bid either nil or four
5lh23uuvx2m_6-8-rgb_front the second person can bid the same
5lh23uuvx2m_7-8-rgb_front they can bid the same as the as their partner took or they can make the other bid
5lh23uuvx2m_8-8-rgb_front if i bid four and my partner also bids four they get to be the four and i have to be the nil so you are going to be opposite what your partner does
5lh23uuvx2m_9-8-rgb_front the other players are going to do the same thing
5o8kza59yzu_1-8-rgb_front the blue triangle right here represents the milk category
5o8kza59yzu_10-8-rgb_front if you are looking at things like processed cheese one slice is enough for one cup
5o8kza59yzu_11-8-rgb_front things like american and mozzarella things like that
5o8kza59yzu_12-8-rgb_front or a half an ounce of hard cheese things like cheddar swiss mozzarella things that come in like the little logs of cheese
5o8kza59yzu_13-8-rgb_front and that is what we have on milk
5o8kza59yzu_2-8-rgb_front now milk is essential for growth of teeth and bones
5o8kza59yzu_3-8-rgb_front the recommended allowance for children ages four to five is two to three cups
5o8kza59yzu_4-8-rgb_front now once over two children can safely switch from vitamin d whole milk to things like reduced fat or even skim milk
5o8kza59yzu_5-8-rgb_front as long as they are healthy and staying in good physically active conditions
5o8kza59yzu_6-8-rgb_front now many parents are giving their kids soda and tea and fruit juices and forgetting how important milk is
5o8kza59yzu_7-8-rgb_front good habits must start young and they also start with you
5o8kza59yzu_8-8-rgb_front if kids see you drinking milk they are going to drink milk and they are going to put down the soda
5o8kza59yzu_9-8-rgb_front now one cup of milk is obviously one cup of milk or a cup of yogurt counts also
5oozg2cmskm_0-5-rgb_front ok the next barrier to communication is really about words but sometimes words can also be used in message distractions and what message distractions are you see it a whole lot on college campuses with tests and that is putting down words and you have to give the right answers to these words
5oozg2cmskm_1-5-rgb_front well words can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people so if a word is spoken or said or used in a certain context that you do not know all of the sudden you have got a barrier to communication
5oozg2cmskm_2-5-rgb_front something else that can happen is if words are used very gender specific
5oozg2cmskm_3-5-rgb_front like if you are at a meeting and someone starts talking about the chairman
5oozg2cmskm_4-5-rgb_front well maybe you are actually the chairman and you are a woman
5oozg2cmskm_5-5-rgb_front all of the sudden that word becomes a distracting barrier to communication because you are thinking about the fact well wait a minute i am not a man
5oozg2cmskm_6-5-rgb_front i am a chairwoman or chairperson so the semantics of words and how they are used and the context in which they are used and the expectation of what should become of them
5oozg2cmskm_7-5-rgb_front words can create a huge barrier to communication
5oq-f-ec_pu_0-8-rgb_front i am going to talk about how an umbrella light is used in photography
5oq-f-ec_pu_1-8-rgb_front now an umbrella is exactly like it sounds
5oq-f-ec_pu_10-8-rgb_front they usually go in a plastic case or sleeving and that is it
5oq-f-ec_pu_11-8-rgb_front i keep them in my studio i try not to forget them when i go on location and that is how i use an umbrella
5oq-f-ec_pu_2-8-rgb_front it is an umbrella that opens up comes out like a parachute and the way i use it most often is in the studio whereas i take my umbrella there is a strobe unit that i have and there is a small little slot a hole that i am going to use the base of that umbrella the stand and i am going to slide it into the hole and i am going to face it towards the strobe so the strobe is going to fire it is going to hit the umbrella and then bounce back in a way so that i can diffuse my lighting
5oq-f-ec_pu_3-8-rgb_front now i do not want to use a raw strobe on someone because it might be a little bit too harsh so that is when i will use my umbrella and i can position my umbrella in a certain way that i can actually control my lighting a bit more than if i am just using a raw strobe or a diffuser so that is how that i like to use umbrellas
5oq-f-ec_pu_4-8-rgb_front there are different sized ones there are big ones there are also different prices
5oq-f-ec_pu_5-8-rgb_front there are some that cost and there are some that can cost easily upwards of to bucks
5oq-f-ec_pu_6-8-rgb_front there are also different colors
5oq-f-ec_pu_7-8-rgb_front you might have a white a silver or a gold for a warming effect on these on whatever you are photographing
5oq-f-ec_pu_8-8-rgb_front i want to always be a little bit careful with my umbrellas i want to make sure that i open them up carefully close them down carefully because the ribbing on them can easily rip and i always want to treat them nicely so i do not have to go out and buy another umbrella if i have not handled it correctly
5oq-f-ec_pu_9-8-rgb_front they also fold back up
5pm9nrxm-l0_0-8-rgb_front hi i am ty brown with dogbehavioronline com
5pm9nrxm-l0_1-8-rgb_front i am here today in riverton utah teaching you how to train a dog
5pm9nrxm-l0_10-8-rgb_front as the dog progresses in this training you make the searches longer you make them harder you put up more obstacles and soon the dog starts to realize if i really want to find this person i have to use all of my senses
5pm9nrxm-l0_11-8-rgb_front i have to listen for him i have to smell him i have to look for him
5pm9nrxm-l0_12-8-rgb_front and so in this way you have a dog that is very that uses all of his skills and all of his senses in order to find people
5pm9nrxm-l0_13-8-rgb_front as the dog progresses in this then you take it out for real and you go out into the woods and you have people hide and you give the dog the scent of that person and encourage the dog to find them
5pm9nrxm-l0_14-8-rgb_front when the dog finds that person you have already set that person up with maybe some treats or maybe a ball if the dog really enjoys the ball or some other reward that is very motivating for that dog
5pm9nrxm-l0_15-8-rgb_front over time the dog will start to understand the scent of this person mixed with me going out and finding him ends up with a fun game and a fun reward
5pm9nrxm-l0_16-8-rgb_front and so that is how you train a dog a rescue dog
5pm9nrxm-l0_2-8-rgb_front the topic of today is discussion is teaching you how to train for a rescue dog
5pm9nrxm-l0_3-8-rgb_front now a rescue dog serves a very a very useful purpose
5pm9nrxm-l0_4-8-rgb_front people get lost all the time out in the woods or out in the open and can not find their way back
5pm9nrxm-l0_5-8-rgb_front they may be injured or something like that and so the rescue dog serves a very important function of finding lost hikers finding lost travelers finding lost people that have that have lost their way
5pm9nrxm-l0_6-8-rgb_front now you can actually start training a rescue dog from a very young age
5pm9nrxm-l0_7-8-rgb_front from the time the dog is a puppy you can even make it much of a game
5pm9nrxm-l0_8-8-rgb_front you can have someone hold the dog while you the dog owner run off and just hide around a corner
5pm9nrxm-l0_9-8-rgb_front you release the dog as you give the dog as you give the command to search and when the dog finds you he gets tons of praise and and it is just this big game
5r_edfcfup0_0-3-rgb_front alright now that we have planted the seed we want to take the rake here make sure there is no weeds still hanging out in the bed after moving the dirt around a little bit
5r_edfcfup0_1-3-rgb_front we want to get rid of the weeds so we can tell the difference between the lettuce that comes up
5r_edfcfup0_2-3-rgb_front we do not want to have any weeds in the way
5r_edfcfup0_3-3-rgb_front we will pull a few more of these weeds out of the way and were going to rake it in
5r_edfcfup0_4-3-rgb_front now with lettuce it does not like to be covered up with dirt too much just wants to be raked in
5r_edfcfup0_5-3-rgb_front these rows here that i have put in rows we are just to lightly rake around just to get some dirt over top of them
5r_edfcfup0_6-3-rgb_front lettuce seeds need light in order to germinate so we do not want to cover them up
5r_edfcfup0_7-3-rgb_front now once we rake it
5r_edfcfup0_8-3-rgb_front we are just going to take the rake and secure the dirt a little bit there nice and packed down
5r_edfcfup0_9-3-rgb_front alright there we go
5s5lunrt85m_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to go over basic kite maintenance and you know how to take care of your kite make sure that it is in proper working order at all times
5s5lunrt85m_1-8-rgb_front one thing that can happen now with these new found or these new age kites you know there is a lot of advancements that make things a lot more a lot more forgiving
5s5lunrt85m_10-8-rgb_front different companies use specific styles for you know their inflation systems
5s5lunrt85m_11-8-rgb_front the new age kites are all one pump systems
5s5lunrt85m_12-8-rgb_front so if you can get a kite where you are going to put it on and inflate it all from a single point it will inflate all these struts including your leading edge all from right here
5s5lunrt85m_13-8-rgb_front other kites are you know new wholesale kites are going to have separate you know inflation points for each one here
5s5lunrt85m_14-8-rgb_front and you know that can be cool because you are making sure that you isolate air from every compartment but it is definitely going to add a couple of extra seconds on to your you know sort of time when you are trying to get into it
5s5lunrt85m_15-8-rgb_front so if you do not have very much time you just like you know you are taking a lunch break and you want to get out and have a session a newer kite with a one pump system is going to help you out
5s5lunrt85m_2-8-rgb_front things like bridles which are attached to the leading edge right here
5s5lunrt85m_3-8-rgb_front you know they are really good they help with they give you a much larger wind range but at the same time it is one extra thing if it goes wrong and breaks on you it can send you into what is called a like a death loop where your kite just looping looping looping and taking you for a ride
5s5lunrt85m_4-8-rgb_front so making sure these things are in proper working order at all times is definitely going to help you in the long run
5s5lunrt85m_5-8-rgb_front so pretty much every time you go in and out for a session you want to check your kite and go over everything
5s5lunrt85m_6-8-rgb_front this is a kite from cabrinha it is a light wind specific kite so you know it is a larger meterage kite
5s5lunrt85m_7-8-rgb_front inside here there is actually bladders that are basically going to hold all the air for you
5s5lunrt85m_8-8-rgb_front these bladders can you know pretty much get pinholes any sort of tear any sort of rupture the glue can come apart and can give you a pretty tough time trying to get them back together
5s5lunrt85m_9-8-rgb_front so you know the more you maintain your kite the more you upkeep it the happier you are going to be
5sfflkf65ey_0-5-rgb_front now we are seeing videos but before any video there is
5sfflkf65ey_1-5-rgb_front what is for a music video
5sfflkf65ey_10-5-rgb_front and far as in mind you know the budget that you are allowed to spend with you know whether how much money can be used in shooting this video
5sfflkf65ey_11-5-rgb_front casting forward who do we want in this video
5sfflkf65ey_12-5-rgb_front where do we want where do we want go
5sfflkf65ey_13-5-rgb_front what kind of feel do we want for it
5sfflkf65ey_14-5-rgb_front all of these things are the things that take place before video takes place
5sfflkf65ey_15-5-rgb_front you know before anything comes to bout it always starts as an idea and that basically what of a video is
5sfflkf65ey_16-5-rgb_front so next time you are watching that video or maybe you are thinking about making your video just remember the most important thing of a video is the of a video
5sfflkf65ey_17-5-rgb_front peace
5sfflkf65ey_2-5-rgb_front well that is all the effort time energy and planning that goes into making that video
5sfflkf65ey_3-5-rgb_front you know your thoughts on where we are going to shoot this video
5sfflkf65ey_4-5-rgb_front how are we going to shoot it
5sfflkf65ey_5-5-rgb_front what is going to be the location

5tihwgy4f1s_0-3-rgb_front hey guys
5tihwgy4f1s_1-3-rgb_front we are here today learning how to play some fun new improv for your improv team and the next that dan b and i are going to show you is a called robot
5tihwgy4f1s_10-3-rgb_front robot noise
5tihwgy4f1s_11-3-rgb_front and that is how you play robot
5tihwgy4f1s_2-3-rgb_front now to play robot you are going to have your team partner up into pairs of two
5tihwgy4f1s_3-3-rgb_front each pair is then going to take turns getting up on stage
5tihwgy4f1s_4-3-rgb_front one person is going to stand right there on the front of the stage and the other person is either going to be off to the side of the stage or down below so that he is off stage or off frame
5tihwgy4f1s_5-3-rgb_front the person actor who is down below is going to make a bunch of crazy noises that they think a robot would make and the player that is on stage has to physically move and justify the noises that are being made
5tihwgy4f1s_6-3-rgb_front the crazier and the more off the wall you can get with your noises the more fun and the more challenging it is going to be for the actor that is on stage
5tihwgy4f1s_7-3-rgb_front so for this example i think dan is going to make some noises and i am going to try to justify them with my body language as a robot would
5tihwgy4f1s_8-3-rgb_front alright
5tihwgy4f1s_9-3-rgb_front i am going to start off with a blank slate
5u5e11ftwbi_0-3-rgb_front before you go out on whitewater adventure and your paddling with your buddies you want to make sure that you know where your going now where it is safe to go and do not paddle out of your experience
5u5e11ftwbi_1-3-rgb_front paddle anything that is above your experience typically the rivers in the us in the united states a lot of them are listed in guide books so you can pick them up at local paddling shops is great
5u5e11ftwbi_2-3-rgb_front a couple of websites one of them is americanwhitewater org that has a national river data base you can get river list things and you can also get some of them have online gage sources so you can tell if a river is running high or low and if its appropriate for you to run
5u5e11ftwbi_3-3-rgb_front i know this river very well i have grown up on it and paddled it for the last years and i can tell you rather the water is low or high it is great to have somebody who is local who knows the river and who knows the ends and outs of every section of the river that they would like to run cause that helps with your day
5udsvjnpi5k_1-5-rgb_front showing you how to fold clothing to put into a suitcase today and grab another one of these outfits that we did previously fold and show you there are different ways to fold these things
5udsvjnpi5k_2-5-rgb_front this is a nice dress here its kind of a jersey material
5udsvjnpi5k_3-5-rgb_front grabbing it at the waist and if look see this is the front skirt area and on this side is the bodice and a sleeve and just going to fold it at the waist back towards the back side
5udsvjnpi5k_4-5-rgb_front and a sleeve you can see the front here kinda wraps around the back part of it and what trying to do here is just straighten out the sleeves a bit so i know where everything is i know if its got creases or not and going to fold it on top of itself and tuck these arms in just a little bit so that not sticking out
5udsvjnpi5k_5-5-rgb_front and here we have one way to fold this garment if your suitcase needs something a little thin and small on one side just fold it in half
5udsvjnpi5k_6-5-rgb_front all right in our next segment be showing you how to fold another garment that going to try and put into our suitcase and keep it wrinkle free and small enough so we fit more stuff in there
5ubw-uxocog_0-3-rgb_front if you got a camera that is got a flash like this you notice that most of the portraits that you take or most of the pictures that you end up taking that use the flash end up with peoples faces that are recognizable but they certainly do not come up to professional standards of quality in terms of a portrait
5ubw-uxocog_1-3-rgb_front there is something very different about a portrait when you are taking a picture and you are using the light on the flash
5ubw-uxocog_2-3-rgb_front you have all seen the ugly pictures that the police get for your driver is licenses and the reason that those pictures are so ugly is because the camera flash or the flash is set right on the camera near the lens and the closer you get that flash to the lens the flatter the light is and the less flattering it is to anybody that is being having their picture taken
5ubw-uxocog_3-3-rgb_front so as you move toward more professional pictures one of the first things that a lot of photographers will do is they will move the flash off the camera using a portable flash unit such as this one that will plug into the camera and then it allows you to move the light where you want to
5ubw-uxocog_4-3-rgb_front but this is another piece of professional gear most people do not have this kind of external things if you are amateurs so we are going to look at other kinds of lighting units that will allow you to accomplish the same thing get professional results without investing a lot of money
5usvsskd3jy_0-3-rgb_front so there are some obvious things that you need to keep in mind when you are doing stretches
5usvsskd3jy_1-3-rgb_front if it is particularly buggy out for instance there are lots of flies around your horse is not going to tolerate real well having you pick up a leg hold it stretch forward like that for any length of time
5usvsskd3jy_2-3-rgb_front so be aware of that
5usvsskd3jy_3-3-rgb_front make sure that your horse is not in a cranky sort of a mood if you are doing that if their muscles are tight or if they are tired it is going to be harder for them to do the stretches and ultimately you want these to be a benefit to your horse
5usvsskd3jy_4-3-rgb_front you do not want to be causing your horse injury or discomfort or cause a horse to resent you for the work that you are trying to do for them
5usvsskd3jy_5-3-rgb_front so pay attention to how your horse is feeling
5usvsskd3jy_6-3-rgb_front pay attention to what your horse is telling you pay attention to their attitude and make sure that you are in a frame of mind to do the work with your horse effectively without getting distracted or just not being present in the work that you are doing
5uy3r6sl4pm_0-8-rgb_front hello have you ever tried to or perhaps are contemplating how to plan an amicable divorce
5uy3r6sl4pm_1-8-rgb_front that for sure is the ideal divorce
5uy3r6sl4pm_2-8-rgb_front my name is dr felicia and i would like to share a few tips with you about planning that divorce
5uy3r6sl4pm_3-8-rgb_front the first thing that would happen is of course for it to be amicable is both persons would have to agree that they want the divorce
5uy3r6sl4pm_4-8-rgb_front now that may happen overtime it could happen early on in the marriage or later in the marriage depending on the couple
5uy3r6sl4pm_5-8-rgb_front but the thing is to bridge the topic of divorce gradually slowly let them know that you are not happy about certain things let the other party know that you would like to talk about it if you can not talk about it and reach a resolution then you would like to make an amicable divorce so that or separation so that you both have certain things that you need
5uy3r6sl4pm_6-8-rgb_front the best way to make it amicable is to be fair not to be greedy to allow for equal acquisition disposition of your assets and to help each other perhaps through the transition period
5uy3r6sl4pm_7-8-rgb_front that is the ideal method of making an amicable divorce
5uy3r6sl4pm_8-8-rgb_front if you can do that and communicate like that you are ahead of many couples
5uy3r6sl4pm_9-8-rgb_front i do wish you good luck dr felicia signing off
5vx_yutowcu_0-3-rgb_front in this clip i am going to show you how to cut the throat out of the fish
5vx_yutowcu_1-3-rgb_front okay
5vx_yutowcu_10-3-rgb_front these backbones are loaded with meat flavor they make great chowder gumbo or you can just cook it up and pick the meat off with a fork
5vx_yutowcu_11-3-rgb_front there is a lot of good meat on here a lot of good flavor and we do not want to waste anything
5vx_yutowcu_12-3-rgb_front chefs love these
5vx_yutowcu_2-3-rgb_front you could leave the backbone on
5vx_yutowcu_3-3-rgb_front we try not to waste any of the fish
5vx_yutowcu_4-3-rgb_front usually in the fish business you paid for the whole fish
5vx_yutowcu_5-3-rgb_front you have paid for everything you see here so you do not want to throw anything away that you can resell that someone can eat
5vx_yutowcu_6-3-rgb_front once again a natural resource
5vx_yutowcu_7-3-rgb_front we are going to you want to break the backbone
5vx_yutowcu_8-3-rgb_front okay we are going to twist grab the head and the backbone we are going to twist the head and break the backbone and pull it off the head
5vx_yutowcu_9-3-rgb_front we are going to take this backbone and we are going to resell it to a seafood market
5vkxcjblh4o_1-8-rgb_front step two what we are going to do here is pick the right quality of paper for our drawing
5vkxcjblh4o_10-8-rgb_front so i found that this is the best paper to use for the thing i am going to be using today
5vkxcjblh4o_2-8-rgb_front now there is a lot of different paper you can use
5vkxcjblh4o_3-8-rgb_front i have drawn thousands of drawings on napkins
5vkxcjblh4o_4-8-rgb_front you can on any kind of paper that will hold ink you can use
5vkxcjblh4o_5-8-rgb_front but i found the best paper for my drawings is just plain i use for my computer to print out plain white sheet of paper and i have had more results with that
5vkxcjblh4o_6-8-rgb_front now paper holds ink really well but it does not work great for coloring on paper
5vkxcjblh4o_7-8-rgb_front so this here holds colored ink really well
5vkxcjblh4o_8-8-rgb_front also i have colored pencils i use but i find that the ink works better with the pencils than the pencils on paper
5vkxcjblh4o_9-8-rgb_front because you always have to keep sharpening your pencils and then they break and it smears off and it makes it hard
5vseaefbfgi_0-8-rgb_front hi
5vseaefbfgi_10-8-rgb_front so to further mark with chalk i would just like i made my marks an inch and a half apart
5vseaefbfgi_11-8-rgb_front so you just run your chalk like that
5vseaefbfgi_12-8-rgb_front it is a chalk that is got a little you can hardly see it but it is a little tracing wheel
5vseaefbfgi_13-8-rgb_front and i will come down another inch and a half and we will trace again
5vseaefbfgi_14-8-rgb_front you will sew on those chalk lines and then you can just rub and the chalk will come off
5vseaefbfgi_15-8-rgb_front this is what you would use on dark fabric
5vseaefbfgi_16-8-rgb_front on this fabric i am going to use the blue side and i am just going to start in the center here and i am just going to draw a blue line
5vseaefbfgi_17-8-rgb_front it is going to scare you at first because you are going to see this blue
5vseaefbfgi_18-8-rgb_front and then i am going to move over and i am going to mark this one every two inches
5vseaefbfgi_19-8-rgb_front and i just keep marking it
5vseaefbfgi_2-8-rgb_front if you want to do lines there is two ways to mark them
5vseaefbfgi_20-8-rgb_front and when i am done with sewing these channels all i have to do is spray it with water and it will just disappear
5vseaefbfgi_21-8-rgb_front it is called mark be gone
5vseaefbfgi_22-8-rgb_front i could use the purple side which will show up a little bit more and by morning that purple mark will have just disappeared
5vseaefbfgi_23-8-rgb_front so that is two ways
5vseaefbfgi_24-8-rgb_front you can even take your marks and go across this way two inches and then when you quilt you will be showing a square
5vseaefbfgi_25-8-rgb_front so there is so many different ways you can quilt
5vseaefbfgi_26-8-rgb_front and then you can call yourself a quilter
5vseaefbfgi_3-8-rgb_front you can do them with chalk or with a quilt marker
5vseaefbfgi_4-8-rgb_front if you use the blue side it will stay on until you sprits it with water and then it will disappear
5vseaefbfgi_5-8-rgb_front so it is a great marking tool for you
5vseaefbfgi_6-8-rgb_front now if we were using chalk
5vseaefbfgi_7-8-rgb_front that is when i would use it
5vseaefbfgi_8-8-rgb_front on this black
5vseaefbfgi_9-8-rgb_front because i could not see
5xsd1nafaxa_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to be learning how to play portal a game by valve software a company with which i have no affiliation
5xsd1nafaxa_10-8-rgb_front we can see the orange portal is above us so if we walk through we just fall down
5xsd1nafaxa_11-8-rgb_front but maybe if we jump through the blue portal it will carry us through and it will launch us out of the orange one to get enough distance to go up these stairs
5xsd1nafaxa_12-8-rgb_front let s see if that works
5xsd1nafaxa_2-8-rgb_front all right here we are going into test chamber
5xsd1nafaxa_3-8-rgb_front you can see there are some stairs here
5xsd1nafaxa_4-8-rgb_front the voice that is talking to me is having some glitches right now
5xsd1nafaxa_5-8-rgb_front that is another sign that things are not well in the world of portal and that even in the world where things are not what they seem things even still are not what they seem
5xsd1nafaxa_6-8-rgb_front so here is our orange exit portal and here are the stairs
5xsd1nafaxa_7-8-rgb_front we can not jump up there we can not jump high enough
5xsd1nafaxa_8-8-rgb_front we need to find a way to use the portals to get us there
5xsd1nafaxa_9-8-rgb_front one thing we can do is make a blue portal here and look out of it
5ymc8pmgeta_0-8-rgb_front let is try a belly pop
5ymc8pmgeta_1-8-rgb_front we are going to start doing it in place so our feet are going to be slightly apart and one foot a little bit in front of the other one
5ymc8pmgeta_10-8-rgb_front so it is going to go front and back and front and back
5ymc8pmgeta_11-8-rgb_front and we are going to accent front and back
5ymc8pmgeta_12-8-rgb_front so push that bell out on the front pull it in on the back
5ymc8pmgeta_13-8-rgb_front push pull in push pull in
5ymc8pmgeta_14-8-rgb_front good
5ymc8pmgeta_15-8-rgb_front push
5ymc8pmgeta_16-8-rgb_front a little faster
5ymc8pmgeta_17-8-rgb_front and push pull in push pull in
5ymc8pmgeta_18-8-rgb_front good
5ymc8pmgeta_19-8-rgb_front rocking front and back
5ymc8pmgeta_2-8-rgb_front our knees are going to be soft and the motion is going to come from our belly
5ymc8pmgeta_20-8-rgb_front front back front back front back
5ymc8pmgeta_21-8-rgb_front other side
5ymc8pmgeta_22-8-rgb_front front back front back front back
5ymc8pmgeta_23-8-rgb_front good
5ymc8pmgeta_24-8-rgb_front make sure you keep that chest lifted so that all the motion is coming from right here
5ymc8pmgeta_25-8-rgb_front so that way they can see what your body is doing
5ymc8pmgeta_26-8-rgb_front practice that in the mirror and make sure everything is in the right place
5ymc8pmgeta_3-8-rgb_front we are actually going to use these muscles here and push it out
5ymc8pmgeta_4-8-rgb_front so you want to be careful not to tilt this too much
5ymc8pmgeta_5-8-rgb_front okay
5ymc8pmgeta_6-8-rgb_front you want to keep your posture nice and long and lifted
5ymc8pmgeta_7-8-rgb_front so make sure your chest is lifted and your shoulders are relaxed
5ymc8pmgeta_8-8-rgb_front we are going to be rocking our feet by shifting our weight front and back
5ymc8pmgeta_9-8-rgb_front so let is start with the feet
5z8xraehsnm_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about some of the features of recreational style boats
5z8xraehsnm_1-8-rgb_front as you can see this boat has got a really large open cockpit so her feet are the only thing that are covered and if she wants to pull her feet out of the cockpit and stretch out that is easy enough to do
5z8xraehsnm_2-8-rgb_front if she slips this boat there is now way she is going to get trapped in the boat
5z8xraehsnm_3-8-rgb_front you can see it is wide boat so it gets a lot of stability from its width a large open cockpit low center of gravity really builds a lot of stability and a lot of confidence in the paddler that the boat will not flip
5z8xraehsnm_4-8-rgb_front this particular boat has a dry storage compartment in the front and one in the stern as well and a dry storage compartment on these type of boats is really you know a very handy thing for those few hours out you can take lunch paddle out to an island if you are down on the river you can take some extra clothing whatever you want to take it gives you that option but to me more importantly it gives you flotation in the bow and the stern so if the worst thing were to happen and you fall out of the boat and the boat fills with water it is not going to sink with that flotation in it
5z8xraehsnm_5-8-rgb_front these boats typically have grab handles on the front and rear and those are to carry the boat but also if you are out swimming you have got some place to attach yourself and pull the boat around
5z8xraehsnm_6-8-rgb_front it is very easy to get back and forth and in and out of the boat and these type boats like the sit on tops have a very substantial seat so there is a ton of support so really a large variety of boats body types ages what have you will have a great time with a boat like this and like all the other boats adjustable foot pegs
5_w9qwhoi1e_0-8-rgb_front the golden rectangle has been used by artists and architects for centuries
5_w9qwhoi1e_1-8-rgb_front the parthenon is built upon the golden rectangle
5_w9qwhoi1e_10-8-rgb_front the beauty of the golden rectangle is that if you take the golden rectangle section here is a golden rectangle section and you draw a square out of that golden rectangle section what you end up with is a golden rectangle here a square here and surprisingly enough another golden rectangle right here
5_w9qwhoi1e_11-8-rgb_front you can divide this space up into fives and eights and squares and you will end up with a whole series of rectangles that are golden rectangle sections and squares
5_w9qwhoi1e_12-8-rgb_front squares and golden rectangles section and everywhere you go you will end up with a square and a golden rectangle
5_w9qwhoi1e_13-8-rgb_front those positions are all where the eye naturally will go if it is allowed to that is where it finds rest
5_w9qwhoi1e_14-8-rgb_front it finds rest there primarily because of the fact that our selves divide that way
5_w9qwhoi1e_15-8-rgb_front when a flower grows it grows in a spiral
5_w9qwhoi1e_16-8-rgb_front the shell spiral of a nodelist is due to that growth rate so it is somehow built into us to like that ratio and when artists discovered it when they started painting and when they started doing things like building buildings they discovered that that was a very perfect shape and established good composition that people naturally liked
5_w9qwhoi1e_17-8-rgb_front i tend to build any structure whether it is a still life or whether it is a portrait and use the golden rectangle as a guideline as a place to start rather than just breaking things down into simple halves
5_w9qwhoi1e_18-8-rgb_front in fact an eight and a half by eleven sheet of paper is basically based upon the golden rectangle
5_w9qwhoi1e_2-8-rgb_front the golden rectangle comes from mathematics
5_w9qwhoi1e_3-8-rgb_front it comes from the fibonacci series of numbers
5_w9qwhoi1e_4-8-rgb_front fibonacci series of numbers is one two three five eight thirteen and so on
5_w9qwhoi1e_5-8-rgb_front if you take the first number and add it to the second number it gives you the third number add those two together it gives you the next number add those two together it gives you the next number
5_w9qwhoi1e_6-8-rgb_front what you end up with is a ratio of one point six approximately to one
5_w9qwhoi1e_7-8-rgb_front one point six to one
5_w9qwhoi1e_8-8-rgb_front we are actually going to cut this so that it is there
5_w9qwhoi1e_9-8-rgb_front five to three or eight to five therein lies the golden rectangle
5abluaxmvkm_1-8-rgb_front before an audition you are usually sitting in the waiting room and the waiting room is one of the best places to be sabotaged for your audition
5abluaxmvkm_2-8-rgb_front you do not want to sabotaged before your audition
5abluaxmvkm_3-8-rgb_front the other actors in the waiting room and as i always tell my students when i teach they are not your friends
5abluaxmvkm_4-8-rgb_front they also are looking for the same part as you are so it is important that before the audition you do not socialize in that waiting room
5abluaxmvkm_5-8-rgb_front you must focus on your dialogue focus on your dialogue focus on your dialogue
5abluaxmvkm_6-8-rgb_front after the audition if somebody wants to talk to you you are more than welcomed to go downstairs out in the parking lot go to lunch have a coffee go to a restaurant but during the actual wait time before the audition is not the time to socialize
5agwuoxnssm_0-5-rgb_front now i am feeling really creative
5agwuoxnssm_1-5-rgb_front so let is add some more to our candy cane and beautiful heart
5agwuoxnssm_10-5-rgb_front now we are going to move this little bubble out of the way because i need to just wrap that underneath
5agwuoxnssm_11-5-rgb_front i am just going to push up from underneath and up and just tuck the little beak in there like that
5agwuoxnssm_12-5-rgb_front now we need to make the shape of the swan is beak
5agwuoxnssm_13-5-rgb_front and we did this in the other series just rolling the beak putting a little pressure on
5agwuoxnssm_14-5-rgb_front you can see where i am doing that
5agwuoxnssm_15-5-rgb_front a little heat a little bit of pressure and squeeze
5agwuoxnssm_16-5-rgb_front just making a basic shape of the little beak
5agwuoxnssm_17-5-rgb_front make your adjustments sit it in place and play about two pretty little swans next to each other
5agwuoxnssm_18-5-rgb_front our final bit of decoration is a inch ruby red heart
5agwuoxnssm_19-5-rgb_front what i do is take the knot come around the back and slip it into this little gap here
5agwuoxnssm_2-5-rgb_front what have we added
5agwuoxnssm_20-5-rgb_front take the knot and just wrap it into place
5agwuoxnssm_21-5-rgb_front go under once straighten everything up just slip the heart into the middle
5agwuoxnssm_22-5-rgb_front there we have loving swans on a candy cane in a beautiful heart
5agwuoxnssm_3-5-rgb_front a swan
5agwuoxnssm_4-5-rgb_front and i made this in the last balloon twisting series
5agwuoxnssm_5-5-rgb_front i will just show you one more time how to add it to the heart
5agwuoxnssm_6-5-rgb_front we just left a little bit in the nozzle there to make the beak
5agwuoxnssm_7-5-rgb_front then i am going to go to the far end of the balloon where the knot is and make a small bubble
5agwuoxnssm_8-5-rgb_front then i am going to wrap the balloon around the heart like making a beak shape and twisting it around and wrap it into the beak a couple of times
5agwuoxnssm_9-5-rgb_front twisting it under just to secure it and i am going to fold into like a figure shape just like we did with the basic swan
5c2ejsafe3m_0-5-rgb_front in this segment we are going to build the clew patch for this omega fourteen jib sail
5c2ejsafe3m_1-5-rgb_front our clew patch dimensions are going to be about tall and taper down to about on the foot edge
5c2ejsafe3m_10-5-rgb_front like the other peel the tape off
5c2ejsafe3m_11-5-rgb_front the clew patch has to go inside of the lines
5c2ejsafe3m_12-5-rgb_front i lined up the leach edge
5c2ejsafe3m_13-5-rgb_front i will stick the patch down and now trim along our foot line
5c2ejsafe3m_14-5-rgb_front there is our clew patch
5c2ejsafe3m_15-5-rgb_front you can see the patch does not go all the way to the edge of the sail because we are going to need to fold this edge over as well as fold the foot edge over
5c2ejsafe3m_16-5-rgb_front we are going to go on to sewing the patches down
5c2ejsafe3m_17-5-rgb_front right now i am doing the tack patch
5c2ejsafe3m_18-5-rgb_front kind of the order you want to do is the clew patch is obviously going to be the largest the head patch will be the second largest and the tack patch is well pretty tiny
5c2ejsafe3m_19-5-rgb_front there is the tack patch
5c2ejsafe3m_2-5-rgb_front it will be a nice fanned out radial pattern
5c2ejsafe3m_3-5-rgb_front so all of the load in the sail will be or the load in the clew will be transferred onto these panels
5c2ejsafe3m_4-5-rgb_front the idea with the radial patch is that all the load follows the thread line into the sail
5c2ejsafe3m_5-5-rgb_front before you stick them together you can just lay them out like that and you will get a really good idea of what kind of clew patch you are going to need
5c2ejsafe3m_6-5-rgb_front again i am trimming the clew patch here to make sure the grommet falls in the thickest part where all the layers meet
5c2ejsafe3m_7-5-rgb_front you can not use too much sticky tape so keep taping lots and lots of tape
5c2ejsafe3m_8-5-rgb_front there we go we have a nice wall fitting clew patch
5c2ejsafe3m_9-5-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and tape the backside of it
5c6jezj8l68_0-8-rgb_front my name is christine marquette and i am a registered dietitian with the austin regional clinic and i am going to talk to you about hormones for weight loss
5c6jezj8l68_1-8-rgb_front in the last to years there is actually been a lot of research into various hormones and how they may affect weight loss
5c6jezj8l68_10-8-rgb_front in addition it seems to curb their appetite
5c6jezj8l68_2-8-rgb_front one area of research has involved the hormone oxygen modulin and this particular hormone is found in the gut and in some of the preliminary research when it was injected into overweight or obese people they did lose more weight than those taking placebo
5c6jezj8l68_3-8-rgb_front the exact mechanism has not really been identified
5c6jezj8l68_4-8-rgb_front in addition they really were not sure if these people were losing actual body fat or actually just losing body fluids
5c6jezj8l68_5-8-rgb_front so again very preliminary research on that particular hormone
5c6jezj8l68_6-8-rgb_front its not being widely used yet
5c6jezj8l68_7-8-rgb_front another hormone that is been studied more is growth hormone
5c6jezj8l68_8-8-rgb_front now this hormone it has been identified that when people that are overweight or obese have been injected with it they actually do reduce their body fat
5c6jezj8l68_9-8-rgb_front they lose weight in the method of losing body fat
5dodez2r56m_0-8-rgb_front hi
5dodez2r56m_1-8-rgb_front i am jason mac genius and today we are going to talk about finding wireless internet
5dodez2r56m_10-8-rgb_front i always like to show everything in the menu bar that way you know if you have got a whole line of icons up at the top you are super cool
5dodez2r56m_11-8-rgb_front so we click on our airport and we have got multiple networks up here that we can choose from
5dodez2r56m_12-8-rgb_front pretty much any time you open your lap top lid you are going to get an automatic scan airport is going to go and find every wireless network it can and give you an option to connect to it
5dodez2r56m_13-8-rgb_front if there is a little lock icon over in the corner of it that means you need a password to get into it and if you do not have the password you are out of luck
5dodez2r56m_14-8-rgb_front so we are going to connect to linux and that is pretty much it
5dodez2r56m_15-8-rgb_front i am jason macgenus and it is as easy as that connecting to a network
5dodez2r56m_16-8-rgb_front take care
5dodez2r56m_2-8-rgb_front if you have an apple lap top this is what you need to do to find wireless internet
5dodez2r56m_3-8-rgb_front open it
5dodez2r56m_4-8-rgb_front that is as easy as that
5dodez2r56m_5-8-rgb_front that is really all you have to do
5dodez2r56m_6-8-rgb_front so in finding wireless internet if you do not have an airport icon up here in your menu bar i am going to show you a quick little tip that you can get that up there
5dodez2r56m_7-8-rgb_front we are going to go to system preferences network and we have got airport selected here
5dodez2r56m_8-8-rgb_front we are going to go show airport and show status in menu bar
5dodez2r56m_9-8-rgb_front so now you see you have got a little airport up here
5dqnmgr62_w_0-8-rgb_front okay i said independent not independence independent realtor or being on a team
5dqnmgr62_w_1-8-rgb_front you know this is not a get rich quick business you guys and anything that is worthwhile we all know that in life we have been taught takes a little planning and thinking and it is about working smart and deciding what is best for you
5dqnmgr62_w_10-8-rgb_front what an independent realtor looks like
5dqnmgr62_w_11-8-rgb_front a do not put the cart before the horse
5dqnmgr62_w_12-8-rgb_front you do not want to run out and buy yourself a little office get the best computers get the best coffee machines it is about thinking in your mind okay i am out here
5dqnmgr62_w_13-8-rgb_front i am on my own in one sense
5dqnmgr62_w_14-8-rgb_front you do not have this big broker
5dqnmgr62_w_15-8-rgb_front this is all on me
5dqnmgr62_w_16-8-rgb_front sort of
5dqnmgr62_w_17-8-rgb_front i am an independent realtor
5dqnmgr62_w_18-8-rgb_front here i sit with shelly davis on my card as the independent realtor and i am buying my own cards
5dqnmgr62_w_19-8-rgb_front i am buying my own signs and that kind of thing
5dqnmgr62_w_2-8-rgb_front okay what worked for me
5dqnmgr62_w_20-8-rgb_front so let is talk a little bit more about that
5dqnmgr62_w_3-8-rgb_front okay at the time i got into real estate i was kind of looking at my options
5dqnmgr62_w_4-8-rgb_front i had these children to feed
5dqnmgr62_w_5-8-rgb_front i have got a couple of dogs
5dqnmgr62_w_6-8-rgb_front okay i have got this little business over here but it is i am kind of you know getting out of this business i am in
5dqnmgr62_w_7-8-rgb_front do i want to run out and be an independent realtor and be my own person or do i want to be on a team
5dqnmgr62_w_8-8-rgb_front there is a huge difference
5dqnmgr62_w_9-8-rgb_front let me talk about the first thing we are going to talk about is being that independent realtor
5fcxgweeabo_0-8-rgb_front alright everybody so welcome to the segment on a taper deck or stripper deck
5fcxgweeabo_1-8-rgb_front now like a svengali deck this is a basic trick deck of cards that you can get at a lot of stores even some toy stores carry them under various names
5fcxgweeabo_2-8-rgb_front now the cool thing about this is this appears to be a completely normal deck of cards but there is some sneaky stuff about it that i am going to tell you about in a little while
5fcxgweeabo_3-8-rgb_front you can do all kinds of tricks you can do some variations of tricks that i have taught you in other segments
5fcxgweeabo_4-8-rgb_front they can be shuffled and cut and everything and handled like normal cards so even though they appear to be completely normal they are not
5fcxgweeabo_5-8-rgb_front and in the next few videos i will be teaching you all kinds of cool ways to use this to do all kinds of entertaining tricks
5fcxgweeabo_6-8-rgb_front so stick around and we will talk about the stripper deck
5g5x8cljosu_0-3-rgb_front ok now we have had this great birthday speech we have given it we have had the toast where we have toasted our birthday girl or guy and now in a lot of scenarios this is going to be the moment when you give the gift
5g5x8cljosu_1-3-rgb_front now this does not always happen but this would be the kind of situation where maybe everybody in the office pitched in and got them a gift or a group of people got the gift
5g5x8cljosu_2-3-rgb_front this is not where you one participant in a party give your gift
5g5x8cljosu_3-3-rgb_front this is more of a group type gift
5g5x8cljosu_4-3-rgb_front and all you have to do is make a you know a really simple statement on behalf of everyone in the room and you always want to make sure you mention everyone who was responsible for giving the gift
5g5x8cljosu_5-3-rgb_front now you do not have to name them all you know do not have to say on behalf of jim tom sally bob ricky no
5g5x8cljosu_6-3-rgb_front but on behalf of the whole accounting department or the whole you know water cooler hang out group or whatever it is you want to mention all of them and then present the gift to the birthday girl or guy and at this point they will come up and accept the gift and usually they will open it and then you are done
5g5x8cljosu_7-3-rgb_front you have just well you have just given a great birthday speech i am impressed
5jtzjzupj88_0-3-rgb_front in this segment of how to lose your slice and get a hook i am going to relate hooking to hitting a tennis forehand with top spin
5jtzjzupj88_1-3-rgb_front oh i know what you are thinking
5jtzjzupj88_10-3-rgb_front what a great story can not go into it right now
5jtzjzupj88_11-3-rgb_front we only have two minutes
5jtzjzupj88_12-3-rgb_front right there
5jtzjzupj88_13-3-rgb_front forehand with top spin
5jtzjzupj88_14-3-rgb_front tennis players you know what i am talking about
5jtzjzupj88_15-3-rgb_front now if you want to do it with two hands make believe it is a two hand forehand with top spin
5jtzjzupj88_16-3-rgb_front you can see that that is going to hook the ball
5jtzjzupj88_17-3-rgb_front you can see that that is going to hook the ball
5jtzjzupj88_18-3-rgb_front then when you are on the golf course do not go oh i am going to keep my head down
5jtzjzupj88_19_20_21_22_23-3-rgb_front think about that during your swing tennis racket back top spin and you too could be like me winning us opens in golf and in tennis
5jtzjzupj88_2-3-rgb_front i gave up tennis when i found out making love meant not scoring
5jtzjzupj88_24-3-rgb_front i do not know if they will believe that one
5jtzjzupj88_3-3-rgb_front bob hope
5jtzjzupj88_4-3-rgb_front but if you could hit top spin and that ball is going to hook in tennis
5jtzjzupj88_5-3-rgb_front the same movements can get you to hook the ball in golf
5jtzjzupj88_6-3-rgb_front so if you take a golf club and you could actually practice with one hand tee up a ball with a iron let is say and nice and easy make believe you have a tennis racket
5jtzjzupj88_7-3-rgb_front and you are going to hit a top spin forehand
5jtzjzupj88_8-3-rgb_front racket back you are hand and arm go out to the right and you are turning it over
5jtzjzupj88_9-3-rgb_front you see that that is the move that has got me to win four us opens in tennis
5k66qfwam7e_0-8-rgb_front now let is start combining the strips of our image
5k66qfwam7e_1-8-rgb_front what we want to do is we want to take one strip and then make some room to put the first strip of the second image and then take the strip of the first image put it next to that and keep alternating as you go along and it is going to be one long picture with alternating strips from each image
5k66qfwam7e_10-8-rgb_front so so far in this step i have shown you how to take your images and place them interchange them each strip from one image to the next to make a long mixed image that is going to be folded up
5k66qfwam7e_2-8-rgb_front the important thing over here is just to keep everything in order
5k66qfwam7e_3-8-rgb_front make sure that you are putting the strips one after the other in the right consecutive order otherwise it gets a finished product will not work and it gets a little confusing if you do not take note as you are putting in the images
5k66qfwam7e_4-8-rgb_front one of the signs that you should look for when completing the interchanging of the strips is that you have started with one image the first image and you have actually ended with the last piece being from the second image
5k66qfwam7e_5-8-rgb_front and that is one indication to know that you actually combined the image properly
5k66qfwam7e_6-8-rgb_front also it is important to maybe when you create the image images knowing that you are going to have to interchange them like this to make them very distinct colors or possibly a different a different type of shape or image entirely so that this part of the project does not get too confusing
5k66qfwam7e_7-8-rgb_front but we see that we have combined all the images all the different shapes and now we are going to put these together
5k66qfwam7e_8-8-rgb_front we are going to carefully flip it over and put tape so that all of these strips stick together and then it is going to be folded up like an accordion shape and once it is folded up it will become half its size and then we will be able to put it directly on a piece of regular white paper the same size as the original image
5k66qfwam7e_9-8-rgb_front so that is what we are going to do next
5lhdugrvakm_0-3-rgb_front alright now that we got the upside down handle in place we want to kind of just let it find its way on the pot
5lhdugrvakm_1-3-rgb_front you do not want to force it anywhere because it wants to go somewhere it will go i think it wants to go up here
5lhdugrvakm_2-3-rgb_front so take my needle tool and get rid of this clay because it is getting in my way alright
5lhdugrvakm_3-3-rgb_front take a look at my pot alright i think
5lhdugrvakm_4-3-rgb_front what you always want to do is get it on there a little bit get it on there a little bit and put it put the pot down and look at it see if it really needs to be there because it i can take this off and put another one on
5lhdugrvakm_5-3-rgb_front i can do that all day long without destroying the pot
5lhdugrvakm_6-3-rgb_front so just kind of stick it on there and i think it works so from here we are going to start melting this into the rest of the pot
5luhdo0imx4_0-5-rgb_front once you have the body of your scarecrow stuffed now you can go back in and your spaces are going to be tighter so we are going to fill those back in with hay especially around the neck you want to have a good crown of hay coming out
5luhdo0imx4_1-5-rgb_front so you just want to loosely pull apart pieces of your hay and cut them up
5luhdo0imx4_2-5-rgb_front i am just going to start cutting off some pieces of hay here and i am going to take the neck of the scarecrow i want to cover up these safety pins from where we fastened him so i am just going to start pushing that down in between and pulling out the ends and you are going to do that all the way around your scarecrow
5luhdo0imx4_3-5-rgb_front you want to have a good amount of that hay coming out
5luhdo0imx4_4-5-rgb_front the same thing and another thing you can do is you can cut small holes in the body of the shirt and put some hay in there and allow that to come through and we are going to do that with our pants legs later but if you do not have jeans or pants that are ripped up you can do that with the shirt and that is just another effect that it is going to create
5luhdo0imx4_5-5-rgb_front so again we are going to take some hay and just loosely pull it through all the way around and i am covering up these safety pins that i used to secure my head of my scarecrow to my body and that is the effect you are going for
5luhdo0imx4_6-5-rgb_front now i am going to flip him over and continue the same on the back
5mylxff9nwm_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is mary thinnes and i am a skin care expert
5mylxff9nwm_1-8-rgb_front the next topic i am going to discuss with you is how to properly treat sallow skin
5mylxff9nwm_2-8-rgb_front sallow skin is dull skin
5mylxff9nwm_3-8-rgb_front it is basically not breathing properly it looks bland and does not look like it is alive
5mylxff9nwm_4_5-8-rgb_front with sallow skin you want to definitely be sure that you are exfoliating properly as i mentioned before you want to do this no more than twice a week so definitely with sallow skin they do have built up dead skin cells on the surface and they have not been properly treating their skin
5mylxff9nwm_6-8-rgb_front they might have thought they were treating their skin with proper products but if you have dead skin cells built up on the surface and they are not slothing off or you are not exfoliating properly nothing is going to come in or nothing if going to come out and basically it is like having a barrier over the top of your skin and you put something on top of a barrier like a piece of wood for instance and it is not going to be absorbed in and it is not going to go out it is just going to sit there
5mylxff9nwm_7-8-rgb_front with sallow skin in order for you to achieve that healthy skin glowing look you want to definitely exfoliate use your papaya and enzyme treatments and properly treat your skin so your products will work as well
5newwsxjb1i_0-8-rgb_front palm ball is exactly what the name might suggest
5newwsxjb1i_1-8-rgb_front the ball is held severely back in the palm and is choked a great deal
5newwsxjb1i_2-8-rgb_front this position of having the ball back in your palm and your fingers basically wrapped around the ball causes the ball to lose its velocity and works much like a change up in its actions and the fact that it looks like a fast ball it acts like a fast ball but it is several miles per hour slower than the fast ball
5newwsxjb1i_3-8-rgb_front that is what makes it an effective pitch
5newwsxjb1i_4-8-rgb_front it is used basically in the same situations as a change up would be used where you are trying to deceive the batter by changing speeds and that is a palm ball
5nk3hs9uhl0_0-8-rgb_front if you have a sick bird there are several things to remember
5nk3hs9uhl0_1-8-rgb_front but the first and foremost is to get that bird isolated away from all your other birds as fast as possible
5nk3hs9uhl0_10-8-rgb_front say from moving it from one location to another
5nk3hs9uhl0_11-8-rgb_front marvel aid works real well for minor things
5nk3hs9uhl0_12-8-rgb_front but there is nothing that can beat the intelligence and knowledge of an avian vet when you have a sick bird
5nk3hs9uhl0_13-8-rgb_front and more than likely that will be the only way you will be able to save that bird
5nk3hs9uhl0_14-8-rgb_front if your bird has been exposed to smoke near a fire or anywhere where the smoke has got to the bird birds cannot get that smoke out of their lungs
5nk3hs9uhl0_15-8-rgb_front they may go on for months and never show a sign and then all of the sudden you loose that bird
5nk3hs9uhl0_16-8-rgb_front fires are very dangerous to birds and i myself even had a fire in which i thought my birds were fine and then months later i started loosing them and it was said that it was due to the smoke in their lung
5nk3hs9uhl0_2-8-rgb_front then the bird needs warmth
5nk3hs9uhl0_3-8-rgb_front use a heating pad a brooder anything that you can to get warmth to that bird
5nk3hs9uhl0_4-8-rgb_front i would suggest highly that when you know a bird is sick that you see a an avian vet
5nk3hs9uhl0_5-8-rgb_front they are not a lot of avian vets around but there are many good ones around
5nk3hs9uhl0_6-8-rgb_front the reason being that a bird does not show that it is sick until it is well sick
5nk3hs9uhl0_7-8-rgb_front because they are attuned to hiding any illness away from their flock so that they will not be banned from the flock
5nk3hs9uhl0_8-8-rgb_front so by the time you can see that a bird is sick it has been sick for a while
5nk3hs9uhl0_9-8-rgb_front i use marvel aid if a bird is just being stressed
5ok8y3eheq8_0-1-rgb_front my name is anthony maddaloni
5ok8y3eheq8_1-1-rgb_front i am a professional photographer from austin texas and i am going to talk a little bit about the different types of film that you can shoot with a large format camera
5ok8y3eheq8_10-1-rgb_front what makes the difference
5ok8y3eheq8_11-1-rgb_front and it is not really so much of a better or worse it is just the difference and that is what is very interesting to me
5ok8y3eheq8_12-1-rgb_front one other thing that is interesting to point out that if you are going to shoot slide film or chrome film sometimes it is referred to as process film
5ok8y3eheq8_13-1-rgb_front you want to make sure your exposure is absolutely correct
5ok8y3eheq8_14-1-rgb_front slide film there is really no latitude for over or under exposing and that is a really important thing to know because one it is pretty expensive so you do not want to go through a whole bunch of film
5ok8y3eheq8_15-1-rgb_front you are going to lose some money
5ok8y3eheq8_16-1-rgb_front so you want to have a nice meter a nice system of making an exposure that is going to be correct and everything will really work out for you
5ok8y3eheq8_17-1-rgb_front the other thing about chrome film color film is that you might want to keep it in the fridge
5ok8y3eheq8_18-1-rgb_front that is a really good place
5ok8y3eheq8_19-1-rgb_front if it gets hot you are going to have a shift meaning your film has essentially gone bad
5ok8y3eheq8_2-1-rgb_front it is four by five
5ok8y3eheq8_20-1-rgb_front so that is some of the types of film that you can use with a camera
5ok8y3eheq8_3-1-rgb_front this is a piece of black and white film
5ok8y3eheq8_4-1-rgb_front now black and white film you can still buy
5ok8y3eheq8_5-1-rgb_front you can still develop it yourself
5ok8y3eheq8_6-1-rgb_front so it is really very available easily easily gotten
5ok8y3eheq8_7-1-rgb_front the other types of film that you can use with a camera are color print film and chrome film and this is where it gets kind of interesting because if you look compared to a modern day digital print color print even a very high end one compared to a print that was made with chrome film that is slide film you are going to see differences
5ok8y3eheq8_8-1-rgb_front some of them are subtle and some of them are not so subtle
5ok8y3eheq8_9-1-rgb_front and that is one thing that really interests me as a photographer is what is it
5pvdt18f92a_0-8-rgb_front clancy rose now we will get into steaming the milk
5pvdt18f92a_1-8-rgb_front there are three processes in preparing the milk for a single cappuccino
5pvdt18f92a_2-8-rgb_front and the first is after you have the pitcher like this and the steam wand is in the milk and after you turn on the steam wand and start steaming the first process that you are going to do is kind of hold it
5pvdt18f92a_3-8-rgb_front i would like to hold the pitcher in this groove here and hold it at an angle and get the milk rolling so it is kind of spinning inside the pitcher while the tip of the steam wand is submerged in the milk
5pvdt18f92a_4-8-rgb_front right when you can feel the milk break into the same temperature as your hand which is about a hundred degrees right when you can feel it warm up you will drop it down to start stretching or introducing air and that is where you are making the foam in the milk and that is what you are going to do
5pvdt18f92a_5-8-rgb_front you are not going to have to do as much for a lighter like a skim milk or something like that
5pvdt18f92a_6-8-rgb_front more foam is created more evenly with a lighter milk
5pvdt18f92a_7-8-rgb_front and then the third process is you push the pitcher back up submerge the steam wand once again and then get it spinning again and that is going to blend your foam with your steam milk and kind of get a nice consistency throughout the milk
5pvdt18f92a_8-8-rgb_front so i will demonstrate that
5q5q5d8vp24_0-8-rgb_front in this segment i am going to explain how the hammer swing can help you select clubs when you are between two clubs
5q5q5d8vp24_1-8-rgb_front i am sure that many times you are in a situation where you do not know if you should use one club and swing hard or use a less of an angle club a stronger club and hit it easy
5q5q5d8vp24_10-8-rgb_front obviously if a carpenter had a chance to hit in a nail would he rather go like this or like this
5q5q5d8vp24_11-8-rgb_front it is always easier with a smaller swing
5q5q5d8vp24_12-8-rgb_front the hammer swing clears that up very easily
5q5q5d8vp24_13-8-rgb_front if you are between clubs and you are using the hammer swing go with the longer club and swing easy when you are in between two clubs on the course
5q5q5d8vp24_2-8-rgb_front for example you are a certain distance yards yards and you do not know if you should swing hard at an iron or easy with a iron
5q5q5d8vp24_3-8-rgb_front the hammer swing and you probably know the answer already makes this very clear and easier to do
5q5q5d8vp24_4-8-rgb_front because we know that it is more difficult to hit a nail straight in with a bigger harder swing than it is with a shorter easier swing
5q5q5d8vp24_5-8-rgb_front so if you are between clubs let is say you are not sure if it is an iron or a iron
5q5q5d8vp24_6-8-rgb_front would you take that iron look at that nail and hit that nail in super hard
5q5q5d8vp24_7-8-rgb_front or would you take a iron and take less of a swing
5q5q5d8vp24_8-8-rgb_front you see that nail and you want to hit that nail in easier
5q5q5d8vp24_9-8-rgb_front which one is easier to do
5qji7jfwr3m_0-8-rgb_front okay so when you actually get down to the pressure washing stage and you have the machine on it is making all the noise you just take and get you have to stay back from the wood
5qji7jfwr3m_1-8-rgb_front if you get really close to the wood it is going to damage the wood
5qji7jfwr3m_10-8-rgb_front you have to be very symmetrical or congruent to get across here to make sure that everything is just nice and clean and there is no stripes in it or you will end up with stripes when you finish the deck
5qji7jfwr3m_11-8-rgb_front okay so you have pressure washed your deck you have got it all down and nice and clean
5qji7jfwr3m_12-8-rgb_front in arizona here it will dry out in hours but you have to make sure that the redwood is nice and dry before you put any of your treatments on
5qji7jfwr3m_13-8-rgb_front if you are in another climate where it is wet or very humid you might have to wait two to three days
5qji7jfwr3m_14-8-rgb_front you do not want to apply the treatment if there is any moisture in your deck because it will tend to bubble
5qji7jfwr3m_2-8-rgb_front you need to stay back like eight to twelve inches away from the wood
5qji7jfwr3m_3-8-rgb_front you sweep it back and forth and you have to make sure you cover all the wood
5qji7jfwr3m_4-8-rgb_front if you do not cover all the wood you are going to have streaks in it when you take and refinish it
5qji7jfwr3m_5-8-rgb_front and the pressure washer will take off most everything that needs to be taken off and in fact if the wood is very old it will make the wood furry
5qji7jfwr3m_6-8-rgb_front that means it will have fibers out of the wood
5qji7jfwr3m_7-8-rgb_front so then you can just go back over the wood with an orbital sander and just take the furriness off the wood because you do not want the wood to be furry when you are finishing it
5qji7jfwr3m_8-8-rgb_front now you have your pressure washer on and you are pressure washing the deck up here and the boards and you are taking off the dirt
5qji7jfwr3m_9-8-rgb_front you have to make very sure that you do not skip over places and or it will make lines where you leave the dirt and debris on here
5qsnhynrwyq_1-3-rgb_front there are several things that you will not want to discuss during the interview such as you have the legal right not to be asked about your personal life your religion your children or what your husband does

5rtrgkznflo_0-5-rgb_front now earlier we talked about what is in hookah tobacco especially comparatively to cigarettes
5rtrgkznflo_1-5-rgb_front hookah tobacco has got four main ingredients in it that are found in every kind of shisha you can think of
5rtrgkznflo_2-5-rgb_front the number one thing of course is the natural tobacco leaf
5rtrgkznflo_3-5-rgb_front if you are going to make your own tobacco you need to get some good quality natural tobacco leaf dry it out get it cut up and kind of grind that stuff up and then you want to blend that with whatever flavor you are going to be doing
5rtrgkznflo_4-5-rgb_front so let is say you are doing mango you would actually blend it with the fruit the mango flavoring and then you could mix in honey and molasses and it makes kind of syrupy thing there and then you just add more tobacco to make the right consistency that you want
5rtrgkznflo_5-5-rgb_front so those are the things that are in the hookah compared to the cigarettes as you can see four ingredients compared to ingredients
5rtrgkznflo_6-5-rgb_front so very minimal as far as what you are intaking in your body
5rtrgkznflo_7-5-rgb_front there are no surprises here you know what you are smoking
5rtrgkznflo_8-5-rgb_front there is nothing that you can not pronounce in hookah tobacco
5rtrgkznflo_9-5-rgb_front so here is ashli smoking some more hookah
5sfopw5lya4_0-8-rgb_front ben graham playing offense you need a bat
5sfopw5lya4_1-8-rgb_front you gotta have something to hit the ball
5sfopw5lya4_10-8-rgb_front sometimes you will find them wrapped in leather
5sfopw5lya4_11-8-rgb_front this type of of you if you have played baseball at all this is what you are most familiar with
5sfopw5lya4_12-8-rgb_front this is what is used in percent of the games of baseball in the united states
5sfopw5lya4_13-8-rgb_front in the major league level and in the minor league level when you get into the professional baseball they do use wooden bats
5sfopw5lya4_14-8-rgb_front i like to one is actually a little small but normally i swing a bat
5sfopw5lya4_15-8-rgb_front this is one is a bat
5sfopw5lya4_16-8-rgb_front this is well suited for a smaller player
5sfopw5lya4_17-8-rgb_front if there are ladies watching this is probably the size of bat that you would use
5sfopw5lya4_18-8-rgb_front if you are about between and this might be the type of bat that you would want to use
5sfopw5lya4_19-8-rgb_front and when you hold the bat what you are going to want to do as a batter you will put your left hand on the bottom you are going to put your finger here right on this little knob fold it
5sfopw5lya4_2-8-rgb_front this is how the game gets going
5sfopw5lya4_20-8-rgb_front right around you are going to hold it very loosely in your fingers
5sfopw5lya4_21-8-rgb_front your right hand goes on top
5sfopw5lya4_22-8-rgb_front again you hold it in your fingers
5sfopw5lya4_23-8-rgb_front hold it lightly like an egg take your stance and you swing the bat
5sfopw5lya4_24-8-rgb_front and that is basically how you create offense in the game of baseball with a simple little cylinder called a baseball bat
5sfopw5lya4_3-8-rgb_front this is a standard aluminum bat
5sfopw5lya4_4-8-rgb_front there are various alloys that go into making bats but that is a little bit more than we really need to get today
5sfopw5lya4_5-8-rgb_front what you need to know is the bat is a long cylinder
5sfopw5lya4_6-8-rgb_front it gets fatter towards the barrel
5sfopw5lya4_7-8-rgb_front this is ideally where you want to hit the ball
5sfopw5lya4_8-8-rgb_front this is the handle of the bat and you will notice that it is wrapped
5sfopw5lya4_9-8-rgb_front this is wrapped in rubber
5sdzhvcmdj4_0-4-rgb_front if you are thinking about selling golf balls you find out on the golf course it is very easy to do
5sdzhvcmdj4_1-4-rgb_front my name is jared garbett and i am with echo farms golf and country club and i am going to teach you how to sell golf balls you find on the golf course
5sdzhvcmdj4_2-4-rgb_front collect the golf balls until you have several hundred golf balls maybe even a thousand golf balls and go to your local pro shop or local golf center and see if they have a refurbished golf ball center or see if they sell golf balls two for a dollar three for a dollar
5sdzhvcmdj4_3-4-rgb_front have a bargain golf ball bin
5sdzhvcmdj4_4-4-rgb_front most places will buy the golf balls from you and then resell them in their store
5sdzhvcmdj4_5-4-rgb_front sometimes you may wish to make it a hobby or a small job to go into the local ponds at golf courses or into the woods and search for golf balls there
5sdzhvcmdj4_6-4-rgb_front be sure to check with your local golf course before doing so but it should not be a problem
5sdzhvcmdj4_7-4-rgb_front make sure that you always carry the golf balls back to the pro shop and sell them back to the pro shop that you get the balls from
5sdzhvcmdj4_8-4-rgb_front after doing this you should get a cut of the money and maybe it will make it worth your while
5sdzhvcmdj4_9-4-rgb_front that is how you sell golf balls you find out on the golf course
5us1leos3ki_0-8-rgb_front okay now that i have combed protein based conditioner throughout her hair i need to wrap it in plastic
5us1leos3ki_1-8-rgb_front the reason i am going to put plastic on her hair or a plastic cap either one will work
5us1leos3ki_10-8-rgb_front and it will not work without the plastic
5us1leos3ki_11-8-rgb_front it does not work the same
5us1leos3ki_12-8-rgb_front so you really need to this holds your body heat in
5us1leos3ki_13-8-rgb_front if you have availability to a dryer that is even better but you definitely want to put this plastic on here
5us1leos3ki_14-8-rgb_front if you have a plastic cap that works good too
5us1leos3ki_15-8-rgb_front so either way
5us1leos3ki_16-8-rgb_front plastic cap or saran wrap
5us1leos3ki_17-8-rgb_front and you can actually see it starting to heat up inside
5us1leos3ki_18-8-rgb_front you can see the steam building up
5us1leos3ki_19-8-rgb_front so that means we have got her wrapped properly
5us1leos3ki_2-8-rgb_front but in case you do not have the plastic cap the plastic saran wrap works just as good
5us1leos3ki_20-8-rgb_front and that is how you want to put the plastic on her scalp
5us1leos3ki_21-8-rgb_front make sure she is covered completely
5us1leos3ki_3-8-rgb_front we want to totally wrap her hair in this
5us1leos3ki_4-8-rgb_front just make believe she is a leftover
5us1leos3ki_5-8-rgb_front the plastic wrap sticks to itself
5us1leos3ki_6-8-rgb_front she is totally wrapped
5us1leos3ki_7-8-rgb_front you want to close it in
5us1leos3ki_8-8-rgb_front and that is going to hold in the heat from her head
5us1leos3ki_9-8-rgb_front the heat process helps the conditioner penetrate into the hair shaft to ensure proper coverage
5ujm3zxvd-o_0-5-rgb_front hi this is john stewart and this is how to pack your tent poles for a weekend camping trip
5ujm3zxvd-o_1-5-rgb_front you do not want to take and roll up your tent poles with your tent because it takes up a lot of room
5ujm3zxvd-o_10-5-rgb_front they lay nice and flat against the pack and you do not have to worry about them going anywhere cause they are not going to fall out the bottom of the pack
5ujm3zxvd-o_11-5-rgb_front this is how to pack your tent poles for a weekend camping trip
5ujm3zxvd-o_2-5-rgb_front so you are going to pack and stuff down your tent and put it on the inside of your pack
5ujm3zxvd-o_3-5-rgb_front since your tent poles are normally longer than the inside of your pack you always want to take and put these on the outside of the pack
5ujm3zxvd-o_4-5-rgb_front you can strap these right on the outside
5ujm3zxvd-o_5-5-rgb_front they do not have to worry about getting them wet because you will have a pack cover on
5ujm3zxvd-o_6-5-rgb_front that way they are outside real quick to get to when you set up your tent in the afternoon
5ujm3zxvd-o_7-5-rgb_front and they do not get in the way
5ujm3zxvd-o_8-5-rgb_front the other nice thing about this is you can strap them down nice and tight to where they do not rattle and make a lot of racket while you are out there packing
5ujm3zxvd-o_9-5-rgb_front so most packs are going to have sleeves on the outside of the pack to where you can just slide your tent poles right down on the sleeves get it all the way to the bottom and then you just take and cinch down the straps to where your tent poles will not move on the outside of your pack
5vsvxthed5i_1-8-rgb_front the last piece is just always salt so we are going to salt it with a little bit of sea salt
5vsvxthed5i_2-8-rgb_front actually i always like to use sea salt better then the iodize salt
5vsvxthed5i_3-8-rgb_front sea salt is a lot more natural and your body could really stimulate the minerals that are in the sea salt much better then iodize salt
5vsvxthed5i_4-8-rgb_front iodized salt is very process so we always use sea salt here
5vsvxthed5i_5-8-rgb_front so as you can see that the balsamic has really attach themselves to the string beans
5vd6m__3ync_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is ashley ludman from seaside yoga and i am here to talk to you about becoming yoga certified so there are many different yoga certification programs all across the country and also internationally
5vd6m__3ync_1-8-rgb_front the best bet would be to first go to yogaalliance org and they have a list of all of the registered yoga schools that fall under their or hour registered yoga trainings
5vd6m__3ync_2-8-rgb_front the first thing that i would suggest is to find a teacher that really speaks to you or inspires you and find a specific style of yoga that you are inspired to practice and that will give you a little bit more information about how to go about training in that specific style or discipline
5vd6m__3ync_3-8-rgb_front many of the hour programs have a multidisciplinary approach to yoga teaching so that means that you might get a little bit of one style of yoga and a little bit of another style which is a good basis to begin a certification program so in terms of continuing on with your training
5vd6m__3ync_4-8-rgb_front you can then go into some advanced trainings and take a little bit more time in one specific style so just to recap that
5vd6m__3ync_5-8-rgb_front find a teacher or a style of yoga that inspires you go to yogaalliance org and good luck with your yoga certification journey
5vl23al3mpy_0-8-rgb_front let is take our egyptian walk and travel with it and add our saiidi arm styling to it all right
5vl23al3mpy_1-8-rgb_front left hand facing down right thumb by the ear
5vl23al3mpy_10-8-rgb_front good
5vl23al3mpy_11-8-rgb_front let is take it walking forward
5vl23al3mpy_12-8-rgb_front step right foot and lift
5vl23al3mpy_13_14_15_16-8-rgb_front step lift now feet should be together when you are doing this movement you do not want to be stepping outside here to do the movement
5vl23al3mpy_17-8-rgb_front step and then feet together
5vl23al3mpy_18-8-rgb_front step feet together
5vl23al3mpy_19-8-rgb_front step feet together
5vl23al3mpy_2-8-rgb_front elbow back weights going to shift to the right foot and lift
5vl23al3mpy_20-8-rgb_front step together
5vl23al3mpy_21-8-rgb_front make sure the knee is bent
5vl23al3mpy_22-8-rgb_front good step together
5vl23al3mpy_23-8-rgb_front step elbow stays back

5vl23al3mpy_25-8-rgb_front step together
5vl23al3mpy_26-8-rgb_front make sure you are not bobbing up and down and make sure you drill it in front of a mirror so that you know exactly what it looks like before you take it out into public
5vl23al3mpy_3-8-rgb_front step and lift
5vl23al3mpy_4-8-rgb_front good

5vl23al3mpy_6-8-rgb_front the hand stays stationary
5vl23al3mpy_7-8-rgb_front lift
5vl23al3mpy_8-8-rgb_front step and lift
5vl23al3mpy_9-8-rgb_front step and lift
5wj8qq7-sss_1-8-rgb_front reading book covers part two
5wj8qq7-sss_10-8-rgb_front in the next step you have a book for example the three little pigs and you have america the beautiful
5wj8qq7-sss_11-8-rgb_front most children will choose the three little pigs why
5wj8qq7-sss_12-8-rgb_front because it is cute and it is colorful
5wj8qq7-sss_13-8-rgb_front you are showing them that oh this book here has a lot of pretty photos
5wj8qq7-sss_14-8-rgb_front you are explaining what is on the cover in picture terms
5wj8qq7-sss_15-8-rgb_front and this book look how beautiful that is it looks like it is outdoors with three little animals that might be piggies
5wj8qq7-sss_16-8-rgb_front which one would you like me to read
5wj8qq7-sss_17-8-rgb_front you are showing the child how to make choices and decisions and how later in life how to develop judgment
5wj8qq7-sss_18-8-rgb_front that simple
5wj8qq7-sss_19-8-rgb_front where first you have shown books the second step you are asking them a choice by comparing two different genres
5wj8qq7-sss_2-8-rgb_front in the last session we just looked at the colors and we called these little packages of goodies books
5wj8qq7-sss_20-8-rgb_front that is book covers part two
5wj8qq7-sss_3-8-rgb_front the child now knows the word book and this is a book cover that gives you an idea of what the book might be like
5wj8qq7-sss_4-8-rgb_front so the next step is to maybe choose two books and say hmmm which one would you like me to read
5wj8qq7-sss_5-8-rgb_front the child is going to base their decision simply on the colors and you may say why would you like me to read this book
5wj8qq7-sss_6-8-rgb_front oh because there is a little girl in the picture
5wj8qq7-sss_7-8-rgb_front why would you like me to read this book
5wj8qq7-sss_8-8-rgb_front because there is a character
5wj8qq7-sss_9-8-rgb_front the main thing you are showing at this point is you are giving the child a choice and you are allowing them to compare pictures and they are learning to compare genre
5wmhj2nerqq_0-5-rgb_front ok so now we are hitting a ball
5wmhj2nerqq_1-5-rgb_front the wind is blowing from right to left which means it is just blowing from this direction to that direction
5wmhj2nerqq_10-5-rgb_front or i could aim very far to the right and use a draw which is kind of an easy hook so i aim really far to the right and now by hitting a draw i am going to get a little more distance so then i count so that counteracts the wind the distance robbing wind
5wmhj2nerqq_11-5-rgb_front so if i hit it really far to the right the wind is going to then push it and i might be somewhat on the right side of the fairway
5wmhj2nerqq_12-5-rgb_front so those are the ways you deal with the right to left wind
5wmhj2nerqq_13-5-rgb_front so if i am going to fade the ball i am going to aim to the right side like that
5wmhj2nerqq_14-5-rgb_front and then the wind will correct it hopefully down the middle
5wmhj2nerqq_15-5-rgb_front and but i might want to draw it and then really go right so i am going to close the face a little bit
5wmhj2nerqq_16-5-rgb_front and then the wind is going to blow that right down the middle
5wmhj2nerqq_17-5-rgb_front so what you do not want to do when you have a really strong right to left wind is go down the middle or even play near the left side because the wind can push you out of bounds or into a lot rough and trees
5wmhj2nerqq_2-5-rgb_front and how do we deal with that
5wmhj2nerqq_3-5-rgb_front well if i hit this ball straight down the middle of the fairway and the wind is going from right to left it is going to blow it possibly into the left side of the fair way or the left rough
5wmhj2nerqq_4-5-rgb_front or if it is a real strong wind it could blow it into the out of bounds on the left side
5wmhj2nerqq_5-5-rgb_front so i have to adjust and account for that wind so what i am going to do is there is a variety of things i can do
5wmhj2nerqq_6-5-rgb_front so i am using my five iron here
5wmhj2nerqq_7-5-rgb_front i could then play a thade which means the ball is going to curl it is going to curl into the wind and then the wind is going to straighten it back out
5wmhj2nerqq_8-5-rgb_front and i am going to move some distance doing that but that is one way of avoiding the ball from being pushed all the way to the left side
5wmhj2nerqq_9-5-rgb_front another thing i could do is aim more to the right and i can hit the ball straight and then so if i hit the ball more to the right the wind is going to push it right back into the middle i hope
5wuzywxhxd0_0-8-rgb_front let is take our choo choo shimmy and add a twist to it literally
5wuzywxhxd0_1-8-rgb_front so we are going to first start with our feet up on relevee since we have already tried that hopefully
5wuzywxhxd0_10-8-rgb_front and again speed it up
5wuzywxhxd0_11-8-rgb_front make sure your upper body stays nice and level
5wuzywxhxd0_12-8-rgb_front keep those ankles pulled in toward each other
5wuzywxhxd0_13-8-rgb_front keep your hands from moving around
5wuzywxhxd0_14-8-rgb_front keep your head nice and still
5wuzywxhxd0_15-8-rgb_front very good
5wuzywxhxd0_16-8-rgb_front keep that belly button in
5wuzywxhxd0_17-8-rgb_front and then when you practice this try it different tempos
5wuzywxhxd0_18-8-rgb_front practice it in the mirror so that you make sure your posture stays nice and pretty
5wuzywxhxd0_2-8-rgb_front and we are going to lift our hips up in toward our rib cage
5wuzywxhxd0_3-8-rgb_front watch your upper body
5wuzywxhxd0_4-8-rgb_front make sure that belly button is pulled in nice and tight
5wuzywxhxd0_5-8-rgb_front so we are going to bring it the right hip forward and then bring it back
5wuzywxhxd0_6-8-rgb_front good
5wuzywxhxd0_7-8-rgb_front right hip forward bring the left hip forward and back and forward and back
5wuzywxhxd0_8-8-rgb_front little faster
5wuzywxhxd0_9-8-rgb_front forward forward forward forward forward

5x3cors_t30_9-5-rgb_front it is taking some crab meat and mixing it with making a nice stuffing and stuffing your shrimp with it
5xhms0g2n_q_0-3-rgb_front when is the table command used in competition
5xhms0g2n_q_1-3-rgb_front depending upon the course and where in the country you are competing it is generally going to be used in numerous places throughout the courses
5xhms0g2n_q_2-3-rgb_front sometimes they may have one table sometimes they may have two based on the level of difficulty of the course
5xhms0g2n_q_3-3-rgb_front as i mentioned in prior segments it is definitely important to get to the competition early to do practice runs and see where the table obstacle will be located
5xhms0g2n_q_4-3-rgb_front it is vital to know which obstacles are before the table and after the table so you can direct your dog accordingly
5xhms0g2n_q_5-3-rgb_front as mentioned earlier table will require proper execution and calmness from your dog so they will go into a down stay pause position for five seconds
5xhms0g2n_q_6-3-rgb_front so be sure to know the obstacles before and after the table to ensure that the table stay command will be carried out properly
5xhms0g2n_q_7-3-rgb_front so as mentioned be sure that you get there early to do a good run through with your dog
5xjefxswave_0-8-rgb_front another game that we play that enhances our skills and helps teach our novice riders the art of keeping a cow
5xjefxswave_1_2_3-8-rgb_front what we call on the wall laura is going to do her best to make sure that she keeps and her horse keep that cow positioned so that it is kind of sandwiched between the fence and her horse
5xjefxswave_4-8-rgb_front it gives us the opportunity to learn how to turn that cow by our control and how to pick our angles
5xjefxswave_5-8-rgb_front so that we have plenty of time to work the cow rather than chase it and laura and her horse are doing a great job of showing us how we keep that cow in control against the wall
5xjefxswave_6-8-rgb_front picking our angles and importantly keeping the distance between the cow and the horse
5xjefxswave_7-8-rgb_front often times riders get much too close to the cow in their enthusiasm and effort to work it and then we loose the timing that we need to get our horse positioned to stop that cow on the wall
5xjefxswave_8-8-rgb_front creating the correct angle
5xjefxswave_9-8-rgb_front sometimes we say it is much like shooting pool you have got to time and time the distance and judge the speed to get yourself in the position where you are going to keep that cow under your control
5z6e_azb1dg_0-3-rgb_front now we are going to talk about recovering a dropped stitch
5z6e_azb1dg_1-3-rgb_front you can even use a pencil or a crochet hook or a sewing needle
5z6e_azb1dg_10-3-rgb_front now all you do is knit that stitch and you have saved your dropped stitch
5z6e_azb1dg_11-3-rgb_front is not that exciting
5z6e_azb1dg_12-3-rgb_front let is say that you want to rip something out
5z6e_azb1dg_13-3-rgb_front to rip something out you would take the needle and you go right underneath
5z6e_azb1dg_14-3-rgb_front this is a good example because we have a different color
5z6e_azb1dg_15-3-rgb_front you would pull that there go back in there and pull there and you are out a stitch
5z6e_azb1dg_16-3-rgb_front does that make sense
5z6e_azb1dg_17-3-rgb_front let me do it again
5z6e_azb1dg_18-3-rgb_front let is say that you want to unravel a stitch at a time
5z6e_azb1dg_19-3-rgb_front instead of going and pulling on it and yank yank yank yank what you do is you go and you let it off the hook and you pull that stitch down there
5z6e_azb1dg_2-3-rgb_front you just go in you pull it back up and you are good to go
5z6e_azb1dg_20-3-rgb_front see that
5z6e_azb1dg_21-3-rgb_front i am letting that black and white baby go because i want to get rid of it
5z6e_azb1dg_22-3-rgb_front this one i am just going to knit because we are at the end of the row
5z6e_azb1dg_23-3-rgb_front we are now at black and white
5z6e_azb1dg_3-3-rgb_front let is finish this row
5z6e_azb1dg_4-3-rgb_front knit
5z6e_azb1dg_5-3-rgb_front now i am happy
5z6e_azb1dg_6-3-rgb_front i am back to my regular number of stitches and everything is easy
5z6e_azb1dg_7-3-rgb_front now i know i only dropped one stitch that time but let is pretend that i had dropped another just for practice
5z6e_azb1dg_8-3-rgb_front i have this here
5z6e_azb1dg_9-3-rgb_front what i would do is i would go in here wiggle that stitch on up up and back and put it up on there
5z_z6opeih0_0-3-rgb_front just like a camera has a lens so does an enlarger
5z_z6opeih0_1-3-rgb_front and it is pretty interesting on what these lenses do and what formats these lenses work with
5z_z6opeih0_10-3-rgb_front so this is a fifty a normal lens for printing millimeter
5z_z6opeih0_2-3-rgb_front the lens i am holding in my hand is a fifty millimeter lens
5z_z6opeih0_3-3-rgb_front and that essentially is a normal lens for this enlarger
5z_z6opeih0_4-3-rgb_front and you would use this lens when you are making enlargements from a millimeter image and if you wanted to just make anything from a five by seven to an eight by ten perhaps to an eleven by fourteen
5z_z6opeih0_5-3-rgb_front but different lenses do different things
5z_z6opeih0_6-3-rgb_front and these lenses are also very similar to camera lenses is that they have on them also
5z_z6opeih0_7-3-rgb_front and just a little bit to understand this an on your camera lens controls your depth of field
5z_z6opeih0_8-3-rgb_front the on these lenses control how much light the lens puts out and corner to corner sharpness on your print
5z_z6opeih0_9-3-rgb_front i am going to talk a little bit more about that when we get into printing in here but it is really a very important thing to know that different formats take different lenses
bftbp-lfr0a_0-8-rgb_front bill albin hello i am bill albin
bftbp-lfr0a_10-8-rgb_front and what that means is the person on camera the camera itself should be looking right at them
bftbp-lfr0a_11-8-rgb_front so you would always want to bring your tripod to the eye level or the camera really to the eye level of the talent
bftbp-lfr0a_12-8-rgb_front and what that means is where the camera sits should be looking me right in the eye
bftbp-lfr0a_13-8-rgb_front so then you set up your tripod
bftbp-lfr0a_14-8-rgb_front then what you do is you have a little bubble there much like any construction worker or anyone who needs something perfectly level or carpenter and so forth
bftbp-lfr0a_15-8-rgb_front you would make sure that your tripod is exactly level
bftbp-lfr0a_16-8-rgb_front that way i do not end up looking like i am tilted or something while i am on the news
bftbp-lfr0a_17-8-rgb_front once you have your tripod set up make sure that it is on a proper position
bftbp-lfr0a_18-8-rgb_front make sure that none of the legs are down a hill or that none of on something that will cause damage or problems with the camera
bftbp-lfr0a_2-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about a tripod
bftbp-lfr0a_3-8-rgb_front tripods are very important to every reporter or a photographer is work
bftbp-lfr0a_4-8-rgb_front the tripod is where you put your camera obviously but it is more than that
bftbp-lfr0a_5-8-rgb_front this is what you exactly what you need to make sure every shot is better
bftbp-lfr0a_6-8-rgb_front when you are shooting video it is important to have a steady clear shot
bftbp-lfr0a_7-8-rgb_front and no matter how steady your hands are they will never be as steady as a stationary tripod
bftbp-lfr0a_8-8-rgb_front so when you are using a tripod there is a few things you need to know
bftbp-lfr0a_9-8-rgb_front for example the tripod should always be eye level to the talent
bj8ij9ps2ny_0-8-rgb_front hi
bj8ij9ps2ny_2-8-rgb_front i want to talk a little bit about the difference between sales agent and realtor
bj8ij9ps2ny_3-8-rgb_front now there is a difference and let me explain what that difference is
bj8ij9ps2ny_4-8-rgb_front a lot of times meet people who say they sell real estate and real estate agents but they may not be a realtor a realtor and i belong to a real estate association and by being a realtor i have to pay quite a bit of money every year to belong to that association but i get all the tools and the resources that i need to market your home properly
bj8ij9ps2ny_5-8-rgb_front a sales agent not a realtor will not really have those tools at his disposal and a realtor will have access to the mls which is the multiple listing service
bj8ij9ps2ny_6-8-rgb_front really important and going to talk about that in segments after this but the multiple listing service is really the main place where realtors and their clients go to look for properties pretty much the place to market your home on the internet the multiple listing service
bj8ij9ps2ny_7-8-rgb_front so again a realtor will have access to the multiple listing service so you want to make sure that you hire a realtor
bjiygztywxm_0-3-rgb_front all right folks in this clip i am going to teach you how to draw a cartoon character with a gloomy expression
bjiygztywxm_1-3-rgb_front and we will move right down here to this lower corner here
bjiygztywxm_10-3-rgb_front and to really sell the whole gloomy look we are going to make his mouth hanging extra low and kind of small
bjiygztywxm_11-3-rgb_front not very big
bjiygztywxm_12-3-rgb_front really small sort of a little lips expression
bjiygztywxm_13-3-rgb_front that just looks gloomy
bjiygztywxm_14-3-rgb_front and you can add other things by making his face kind of look longer like that instead of the usual perky way that i usually do it
bjiygztywxm_15-3-rgb_front not a lot of perkiness in this guy is face right now
bjiygztywxm_16-3-rgb_front so those are the visual clues for the audience that this guy is not feeling all that great
bjiygztywxm_17-3-rgb_front the eyes being long and low
bjiygztywxm_18-3-rgb_front the mouth being small
bjiygztywxm_19-3-rgb_front the eyebrows being up
bjiygztywxm_2-3-rgb_front and we will start with the eyes
bjiygztywxm_20-3-rgb_front and that definitely gives away the fact that this particular character is feeling rather low and gloomy
bjiygztywxm_3-3-rgb_front and one thing we are going to do kind of differently about this guy is we are going to definitely sell the gloomy look by making his eyebrows very very low
bjiygztywxm_4-3-rgb_front just like that
bjiygztywxm_5-3-rgb_front almost to the bottom of his eyes there
bjiygztywxm_6-3-rgb_front come in here and draw his nose very quick
bjiygztywxm_7-3-rgb_front and the pupils will be just barely hanging below the lids there
bjiygztywxm_8-3-rgb_front then we will come up here and we will kind of give him sort of a sad eyebrow expression with them just slightly pointed upwards
bjiygztywxm_9-3-rgb_front just like that
bjzfpsaywgi_0-8-rgb_front in this clip were just going to talk about the elements of the track
bjzfpsaywgi_1-8-rgb_front the key element of this track is that it is a dirt track and not a pavement track
bjzfpsaywgi_10-8-rgb_front where the flag stand is about you know give or take ten feet of this flag stand or back from this flag stand on every track is the start finish line
bjzfpsaywgi_11-8-rgb_front we have lights in all four corners and in the middle of the track so that you can know when yellow flag are know when there is red flag if somebody is injured and know you know if its green white flag
bjzfpsaywgi_12-8-rgb_front those are very big safety things
bjzfpsaywgi_2-8-rgb_front so they constantly are watering the track to keep to try to keep the track in race condition
bjzfpsaywgi_3-8-rgb_front the inside of the track where the berm is it is not really built up right now but there is a berm up there
bjzfpsaywgi_4-8-rgb_front you want to stay between the boundaries of the berm and the wall
bjzfpsaywgi_5-8-rgb_front the wall protects the fans the drivers the catch bench is the very important part of the track
bjzfpsaywgi_6-8-rgb_front you know if you start flipping and you do not want to go into the stands because you can injure people in the stands it also keeps you inside the track so you are not going to injury yourself by flipping over and hitting something outside the track
bjzfpsaywgi_7-8-rgb_front the flagman stands in that stand right over there
bjzfpsaywgi_8-8-rgb_front and this is corner one two three and four
bjzfpsaywgi_9-8-rgb_front coming out of corner four that is where the start line is for the and the original start
bjebuyforis_0-8-rgb_front when you are selecting a teapot that is glass it is always best to go with the best brand because glass already is very fragile
bjebuyforis_1-8-rgb_front so you want to buy something that can withstand the heat without worrying about pouring warm water in there prepare the teapot
bjebuyforis_10-8-rgb_front and then you put your hot water in
bjebuyforis_11-8-rgb_front once you do that the teas would rise and you will be able to see the color of the tea
bjebuyforis_12-8-rgb_front mind you i am not worried about the fact that i am putting boiling water in a cold pot
bjebuyforis_13-8-rgb_front and you can see the color changed with time
bjebuyforis_14-8-rgb_front can the camera catch this
bjebuyforis_15-8-rgb_front you can see all the actions of the tea leaves whereas with other teapots the teas are brewing and the only thing you see is what goes into a cup
bjebuyforis_16-8-rgb_front and the flowering tea will bloom
bjebuyforis_17-8-rgb_front and for flowering tea you do not necessarily need to use a tea filter
bjebuyforis_18-8-rgb_front all you need to use is put the hot water in and then you put your tea flower in and it will bloom and take up the whole pot
bjebuyforis_19-8-rgb_front and this will be a wonderful display when you have guests over
bjebuyforis_2-8-rgb_front this is a yana glass teapot
bjebuyforis_20-8-rgb_front and what i mean by this teapot is so
bjebuyforis_21-8-rgb_front do you notice that
bjebuyforis_22-8-rgb_front great pot if you like to see your teas and as well as be able to drink tea when it is a little bit cooler
bjebuyforis_3-8-rgb_front this teapot is amazing
bjebuyforis_4-8-rgb_front you can put it in boiling water and then put it in the freezer and it will not break
bjebuyforis_5-8-rgb_front it is also handmade where the spout when you pour the tea it is a spout
bjebuyforis_6-8-rgb_front you will know what i mean in just a second
bjebuyforis_7-8-rgb_front this is the best type of teapot if you are trying to brew a white tea or a very nice green tea and you like to see the color of the brew and you like to see the leaves dance
bjebuyforis_8-8-rgb_front this is the filter that you put in and you would put your tea leaves in here as such
bjebuyforis_9-8-rgb_front i am using my hands but i recommend using a teaspoon unless you are making it for yourself
bkhavx9rfw0_0-8-rgb_front emil lamprecht now i am going to show you the first snatch trick
bkhavx9rfw0_1-8-rgb_front now this trick has a lot of different things going on
bkhavx9rfw0_10-8-rgb_front it takes a lot of practice but it is pretty cool in my opinion
bkhavx9rfw0_11-8-rgb_front obviously you want to be able to do it on both sides
bkhavx9rfw0_12-8-rgb_front you will usually find that your nondominant hand will have a harder time with an even release but some practice will get it there
bkhavx9rfw0_13-8-rgb_front being able to do able to do it back and forth is very beneficial to developing a routine
bkhavx9rfw0_2-8-rgb_front so it may take a while to get your first successful snatch especially with an even and straight box
bkhavx9rfw0_3-8-rgb_front snatch looks like this
bkhavx9rfw0_4-8-rgb_front now the things that are involved in the snatch
bkhavx9rfw0_5-8-rgb_front first of all a very even upward release is important
bkhavx9rfw0_6-8-rgb_front if the box is kind of all over the place first of all you will not be able to snatch the middle box and second of all it will be very hard to have the center box travel properly towards the center or you can then snatch it or reclamp it
bkhavx9rfw0_7-8-rgb_front also we are using some of the dynamic of the push and pull that i showed you in the separations to push the box you are releasing over this direction
bkhavx9rfw0_8-8-rgb_front then of course you have to catch in a way the center box out from everything else without screwing up the pressure on the other boxes
bkhavx9rfw0_9-8-rgb_front it is a very dynamic trick
bm_z20ga5ko_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to be discussing magic the gathering the card game
bm_z20ga5ko_10-8-rgb_front we destroy him and this is all during the end phase
bm_z20ga5ko_11-8-rgb_front he goes to the graveyard
bm_z20ga5ko_12-8-rgb_front now this zombie avatar which was a three three is now only a one one because he only gets credit for one
bm_z20ga5ko_13-8-rgb_front one zombie is now in play
bm_z20ga5ko_14-8-rgb_front that being done during the end phase as you said when i play the instant during my end phase
bm_z20ga5ko_15-8-rgb_front you must proclaim that it is during the end phase and not for instance during your opponent is upkeep phase because when you are done and your going to do something you must vocalize this otherwise you can not do it
bm_z20ga5ko_16-8-rgb_front that in turn begins the beginning of your opponent is upkeep phase
bm_z20ga5ko_17-8-rgb_front those are the phases of the game
bm_z20ga5ko_2-8-rgb_front the end phase is a part where since it is my turn i can decide i am done or finished
bm_z20ga5ko_3-8-rgb_front usually people just say they are done
bm_z20ga5ko_4-8-rgb_front now this step in and of itself is a phase
bm_z20ga5ko_5-8-rgb_front however the only thing that you can do during this phase is play an instant
bm_z20ga5ko_6-8-rgb_front for instance we are going to tap this for two and a black and we are going to play an eye of lights ending which is a tribal instant elf
bm_z20ga5ko_7-8-rgb_front now this says on the card destroy target creature
bm_z20ga5ko_8-8-rgb_front we are for instance going to destroy the zombie that gave us so much trouble during our combat with its regenerative abilities
bm_z20ga5ko_9-8-rgb_front we are going to destroy the bone emitter
boauiam-p_a_0-8-rgb_front today we are going to be making a wagon from a shoe box
boauiam-p_a_1-8-rgb_front and its going to be a really special wagon with wheels that are going to turn
boauiam-p_a_10-8-rgb_front these are going to be the axles of the front wheels and back wheels one for each set of wheels
boauiam-p_a_11-8-rgb_front we are going to be using masking tape
boauiam-p_a_12-8-rgb_front and we are going to need an empty tissue roll a paper towel holder
boauiam-p_a_13-8-rgb_front this is the roll from the inside
boauiam-p_a_14-8-rgb_front this is going to be the handle of the wagon and its going to be attached to the wagon with a heavy ribbon which is the purple ribbon you see here
boauiam-p_a_15-8-rgb_front and we are also going to be decorating the wagon
boauiam-p_a_16-8-rgb_front for that we are going to either be using we chose to use some flowers kind of soft cut up flowers you can get at any craft store
boauiam-p_a_17-8-rgb_front but you do not necessarily need these kind of decorations
boauiam-p_a_18-8-rgb_front you can just cut up magazines and find different pictures to paste on the wagon
boauiam-p_a_19-8-rgb_front and we are going to be using some tissue paper as well to cover the wagon
boauiam-p_a_2-8-rgb_front and i am going to go through the supplies now that we are going to need to make our wagon
boauiam-p_a_20-8-rgb_front and the main body of the wagon is going to be a shoe box
boauiam-p_a_21-8-rgb_front now the shoe box should have a it should have the top along with it because the top is going to be glued on to the bottom of the base
boauiam-p_a_22-8-rgb_front and we are also going to need a bowl that we are going to use to mix glue and water
boauiam-p_a_23-8-rgb_front we want the glue to be a little bit thinner than its normal consistency
boauiam-p_a_24-8-rgb_front and that is what we are going to be using on the tissue paper to stick it on to the shoe box which is going to be the body of the wagon
boauiam-p_a_25-8-rgb_front and we are going to need some beads
boauiam-p_a_26-8-rgb_front we are going to need eight large beads and eight small beads
boauiam-p_a_27-8-rgb_front these beads are going to be used to hold the wheels on to the wooden sticks on the axle
boauiam-p_a_28-8-rgb_front and you will need to make sure that the beads are wide enough the hole inside is wide enough to fit on to the wooden stick which is going to be the again the axle of the wheels
boauiam-p_a_29-8-rgb_front and we will be using a scissor and its helpful to have a marker and we are going to need some all purpose glue or like a rubber cement type of glue as well
boauiam-p_a_3-8-rgb_front the first thing that we will need is twenty four cds
boauiam-p_a_30-8-rgb_front and these are the supplies needed for the project of making a wagon from a shoe box
boauiam-p_a_4-8-rgb_front they do not have to be new cds obviously but if you have any laying around the house its a good chance to clean out your office drawers and come up with twenty four cds that you do not need
boauiam-p_a_5-8-rgb_front these are going to be the wheels of our wagon
boauiam-p_a_6-8-rgb_front and then we are going to need a paint brush which will be used to apply the glue to the box and we are going to be covering it with tissue paper
boauiam-p_a_7-8-rgb_front and we will need some wooden sticks
boauiam-p_a_8-8-rgb_front these wooden sticks are usually found they are used for grilling on a barbque with a sharp end on one end and they can come in a super market or craft store
boauiam-p_a_9-8-rgb_front we are going to need two of these
bobpytufuzs_0-8-rgb_front hi
bobpytufuzs_1-8-rgb_front in this segment we are going to talk a little bit about how to do the basic tip
bobpytufuzs_10-8-rgb_front so that is a single tip you can actually go right and left
bobpytufuzs_11-8-rgb_front you can actually do multiples little tips to a big tip
bobpytufuzs_12-8-rgb_front and what i like to do is actually tip with my thumb
bobpytufuzs_13-8-rgb_front so those are some of the different ways that you can do the basic tip
bobpytufuzs_2-8-rgb_front now a tip can be done with your fingers or your thumb and the basic thing is is that you want to make sure that you tip it with the pad of your fingers
bobpytufuzs_3-8-rgb_front you do not want to tip it on your nails necessarily
bobpytufuzs_4-8-rgb_front the easiest tips to do are with your pads the soft part of your fingertips and that way it will not hurt
bobpytufuzs_5-8-rgb_front also another way that i do tips is kind of with my thumb
bobpytufuzs_6-8-rgb_front i hold it this way
bobpytufuzs_7-8-rgb_front so basically you want to put enough spin on it either by yourself or with a throw
bobpytufuzs_8-8-rgb_front and a throw or spin would come in and you want to strike the frisbee right in the middle
bobpytufuzs_9-8-rgb_front right in the middle with the with the fatty part of the tip of your finger
bp0ftwelwsm_0-3-rgb_front offset printing use to be the way to go for printing books
bp0ftwelwsm_1-3-rgb_front now it is pretty much use just for high volume printing because you have to print so may to get it in your price range
bp0ftwelwsm_2-3-rgb_front so now and days most people are going to self print on demand type printing where you do not have to print thousands and thousands of books
bp0ftwelwsm_3-3-rgb_front offset printing is one of those huge machines that prints pages and pages and pages very quickly
bp0ftwelwsm_4-3-rgb_front the quality is great but once again you are going to spend a lot of money and you have to print thousands of books in order to make it cost effective or before any offset printer would even consider doing the job
bp0ftwelwsm_5-3-rgb_front so look into your options because now and days there are a lot more options than just your offset printing
bp0ftwelwsm_6-3-rgb_front there is print on demand there is self publishing even traditional publishers do not use offset printing as much anymore because they are not willing to print quite as many books as they use to once upon a time
bp0ftwelwsm_7-3-rgb_front so be sure to check your website do your research find out if offset printing is what you need or if you can go with one of the other newer products that are out there and available
bpoz4-sxqzy_0-5-rgb_front film cameras have been around a long time
bpoz4-sxqzy_1-5-rgb_front basically they have been invented in the late is actually a little after
bpoz4-sxqzy_2-5-rgb_front and they were black and white for many years before they got the color it was probably in the is or is before they got into color film
bpoz4-sxqzy_3-5-rgb_front and they had different size negatives so you could blow them up larger and larger with larger cameras and one of the drawbacks was that the film had to be developed and that the film was costly because every shot that you took had to be on film and you may not need every shot
bpoz4-sxqzy_4-5-rgb_front with digital cameras it is a different story
bpoz4-sxqzy_5-5-rgb_front you do not really use film you use electricity from the battery and it goes onto a memory that is within your digital camera so that really you are not paying a lot and you do not have to go out and buy film and you do not really have to go develop it
bpoz4-sxqzy_6-5-rgb_front it does have to be printed but it can be used just on your computer
bqgyl8k8kze_0-8-rgb_front hello i am kyle brayer and your next leg workout will be the alternating side lunge
bqgyl8k8kze_1-8-rgb_front this is going to work the hip flexors as well as the glutes hamstrings and quads once again
bqgyl8k8kze_10-8-rgb_front then she will come back and we will go with the left leg
bqgyl8k8kze_11-8-rgb_front down and back up
bqgyl8k8kze_12-8-rgb_front the negative portion you can turn forward the negative portion is when she is going down that is the easier portion of the exercise so she will be inhaling and then as she comes back up she will be exhaling
bqgyl8k8kze_13-8-rgb_front that is the alternating side lunge
bqgyl8k8kze_2-8-rgb_front karie is going to start in her athletic stance with her feet just about apart
bqgyl8k8kze_3-8-rgb_front she is going to keep her torso so from her hips to her shoulders in line once again
bqgyl8k8kze_4-8-rgb_front she will put her hands on her hips and she is going to step out with that left leg into a squatted position and then she is going to come back up and that will be one repetition
bqgyl8k8kze_5-8-rgb_front now she will come back to the right squat and then come back across
bqgyl8k8kze_6-8-rgb_front so she is not only getting the side lunge which is working the hip flexors but she is also getting a squat in this exercise
bqgyl8k8kze_7-8-rgb_front let is do one more like that karie
bqgyl8k8kze_8-8-rgb_front here she is going to step out to the right she is going to come down again trying to keep those knees behind the toes so lean back just a little bit for me karie
bqgyl8k8kze_9-8-rgb_front there you go
bqoh1leuulk_0-5-rgb_front okay so we have taken our lump of clay
bqoh1leuulk_1-5-rgb_front we centered it
bqoh1leuulk_10-5-rgb_front and that is now our measurement
bqoh1leuulk_11-5-rgb_front tighten up the end so it does not move
bqoh1leuulk_12-5-rgb_front over here the little wing nut
bqoh1leuulk_13-5-rgb_front okay so now we have measured the height of our mug
bqoh1leuulk_14-5-rgb_front and we are going to now measure the top lip
bqoh1leuulk_15-5-rgb_front use this tool
bqoh1leuulk_16-5-rgb_front very similar tool
bqoh1leuulk_17-5-rgb_front it is just a little smaller
bqoh1leuulk_18-5-rgb_front we are going to measure it and there you can see we have it measured
bqoh1leuulk_19-5-rgb_front this will give us an accurate measurement of the top lip of the mug so that we can make our second mug
bqoh1leuulk_2-5-rgb_front we have opened it and we have raised the walls
bqoh1leuulk_20-5-rgb_front and we will get to that after we do the finishing part on this mug
bqoh1leuulk_21-5-rgb_front we have one more step to do with this
bqoh1leuulk_22-5-rgb_front and then we will move on
bqoh1leuulk_3-5-rgb_front so essentially we have a finished form of a mug on our hands here
bqoh1leuulk_4-5-rgb_front but we want to make another one that is exactly the same
bqoh1leuulk_5-5-rgb_front so what we are going to do is we are going to take these two tools here and we are going to start by measuring the height of the mug like this
bqoh1leuulk_6-5-rgb_front and as you can see we can measure it quite accurately
bqoh1leuulk_7-5-rgb_front and we can say that is the exact height of this mug
bqoh1leuulk_8-5-rgb_front like that
bqoh1leuulk_9-5-rgb_front okay
brbt1zofznc_0-3-rgb_front hello
brbt1zofznc_10-3-rgb_front it is like a cross thing where people stop and look and say wow
brbt1zofznc_11-3-rgb_front it is quite a thing
brbt1zofznc_12-3-rgb_front ordinarily it used to be a white wall but look what they have done
brbt1zofznc_13-3-rgb_front it is really incredible it is beautiful
brbt1zofznc_14-3-rgb_front these are the things that go on in small towns
brbt1zofznc_15-3-rgb_front we try to exist
brbt1zofznc_2-3-rgb_front we are standing in the parking lot of our cinema tinker street cinema and as you can see it is full tonight
brbt1zofznc_3-3-rgb_front it is kind of a nice saturday night
brbt1zofznc_4-3-rgb_front it is cooling off
brbt1zofznc_5-3-rgb_front it was a hot day and everybody is coming to the movies tonight
brbt1zofznc_6-3-rgb_front the people also park along the public highway which is allowed
brbt1zofznc_7-3-rgb_front it is pretty convenient for people to come and it is very very important to the town that we supply off street parking
brbt1zofznc_8-3-rgb_front as you can see today these murals graffiti murals were done by artists who cam from new york city and it was promoted by the varga gallery which is right next door to the cinema
brbt1zofznc_9-3-rgb_front we sort of feed off each other
bra6-tuud0e_0-8-rgb_front hi
bra6-tuud0e_10-8-rgb_front so that means every time there is a contour line it is a foot difference
bra6-tuud0e_11-8-rgb_front so in this map i can tell valleys to peaks where the trail is and you also can find this out by the map key
bra6-tuud0e_12-8-rgb_front the trails on this map are in red the contour lines are brown rivers and water are all blue and i can see if i am going to be traveling at the top of peaks or if i would be down in a valley near the shelters or if there is water nearby
bra6-tuud0e_13-8-rgb_front all these things are very easy to find out with your map and you need a compass to find it all out
bra6-tuud0e_14-8-rgb_front read your map key learn how to figure out the contour lines and learn what the scale is for your mileage and you should have a pretty good day using your map you need a compass
bra6-tuud0e_15-8-rgb_front you just need to steady your map very well and take notice if you are hiking up something or hiking down something and if you are near water or not
bra6-tuud0e_2-8-rgb_front when reading a map of when you are going hiking there are some things to look at right away
bra6-tuud0e_3-8-rgb_front topographical maps show you the elevation
bra6-tuud0e_4-8-rgb_front this one is a topographical map and if you look you can see how these lines all around the map
bra6-tuud0e_5-8-rgb_front drawn lines on this map to demonstrate exactly what these lines do
bra6-tuud0e_6-8-rgb_front it is essentially putting lines on a flat piece of paper to make it seem or look like mountain
bra6-tuud0e_7-8-rgb_front at the top you will have the summit has a circle and if it is super steep on the actual map itself the lines will be closer than the other since this is a steep side
bra6-tuud0e_8-8-rgb_front if it is not a steep section the lines be as close together and you will be able to tell this on the map
bra6-tuud0e_9-8-rgb_front on my map the contours intervals are every feet
bt6nljaingo_0-8-rgb_front in this step i am going to show you how to cut and prepare the wire that goes in the ears of the animal purse as well as the strap
bt6nljaingo_1-8-rgb_front first you are going to need your strap
bt6nljaingo_10-8-rgb_front and you can leave a little extra on the bottom
bt6nljaingo_11-8-rgb_front also use scissors
bt6nljaingo_12-8-rgb_front not your fabric scissors
bt6nljaingo_13-8-rgb_front use your junk scissors to cut this wire
bt6nljaingo_14-8-rgb_front so there we go
bt6nljaingo_15-8-rgb_front it can come off a little bit but you want to make sure it is around the edges because that is what is going to hold up the ear on your purse
bt6nljaingo_16-8-rgb_front also this wire is too short for my strap but the paddle wire is great
bt6nljaingo_17-8-rgb_front we undo that measure it out
bt6nljaingo_18-8-rgb_front again you can make it a little bit longer than your strap is
bt6nljaingo_19-8-rgb_front cut it
bt6nljaingo_2-8-rgb_front you are going to need your ear shape and you are going to need your floral wire
bt6nljaingo_20-8-rgb_front and again use not your good fabric scissors
bt6nljaingo_21-8-rgb_front use other scissors or wire cutters to cut this
bt6nljaingo_22-8-rgb_front and there you go
bt6nljaingo_23-8-rgb_front you have your wire for your strap and your wire for your ear
bt6nljaingo_3-8-rgb_front this is gage wire and this is a little smaller
bt6nljaingo_4-8-rgb_front either one will work well
bt6nljaingo_5-8-rgb_front so now i want you to take your wire and measure it all the way around your ear
bt6nljaingo_6-8-rgb_front and you do not have to go around the bottom
bt6nljaingo_7-8-rgb_front just around three sides is fine
bt6nljaingo_8-8-rgb_front but you want to make sure it goes around the edges
bt6nljaingo_9-8-rgb_front and it does not have to be exact
btjsec67kym_0-5-rgb_front now here is just some quick guidelines for resisting self disclosure
btjsec67kym_1-5-rgb_front now we talked a lot about how you should self disclose how it is a good thing
btjsec67kym_10-5-rgb_front well i can not tell you no but really like what did the boss say be firm be direct i can not give you that information and then move on
btjsec67kym_11-5-rgb_front do not put a stop to it
btjsec67kym_2-5-rgb_front maybe you do not want to maybe it is not the right person maybe it is not the right situation
btjsec67kym_3-5-rgb_front so if someone is trying to get you to disclose information and you do not want to do not allow yourself to be pushed do not let people push you into disclosing something that you do not want to disclose simply refuse
btjsec67kym_4-5-rgb_front refuse to disclose be assertive but you can still be nice
btjsec67kym_5-5-rgb_front you do not have to be aggressive and mean but no i rather not talk about that
btjsec67kym_6-5-rgb_front no i can not talk about that
btjsec67kym_7-5-rgb_front no i am not going to give you that information
btjsec67kym_8-5-rgb_front be as direct as you can about i am not going to give you the information that you want and then try to switch topics and this you might see a little bit more in a work environment
btjsec67kym_9-5-rgb_front well what did the boss say
burqxtta46y_1-8-rgb_front again little league is open to both boys and girls ages to
burqxtta46y_2-8-rgb_front although some leagues do not actually have the big they basically stop at age but other than that the ages are to
burqxtta46y_3-8-rgb_front and once you determine which division your child is in you are going to have to find your local league and you can do that by contacting either the parks or the little league office
burqxtta46y_4-8-rgb_front they will point you in the right direction for that
burqxtta46y_5-8-rgb_front once you determine where your child is going to play you are going to have to get the forms and fill them out and you can get the forms either online
burqxtta46y_6-8-rgb_front usually your local league will have a website
burqxtta46y_7-8-rgb_front or you can just go down to the local league office and pick it up
burqxtta46y_8-8-rgb_front once you fill out your forms you are going to want to have a copy of your child is birth certificate to turn in with the forms
burqxtta46y_9-8-rgb_front so if you do not happen to have a copy of the birth certificate handy be sure that you send away for it on time so that you can have it to turn it in before the season begins otherwise your child will not be allowed to play
bvgs_-tnhvk_10-5-rgb_front so we are still moving forward and back and allowing our weight to shift instead of just walking side to side right
bvgs_-tnhvk_11-5-rgb_front so now make sure your practice that with your left foot stepping forward and your right foot anchored so that you get a nice even work on both sides of the body
bvgs_-tnhvk_12-5-rgb_front i am johanna krynyzky with hip expressions belly dance studio helping you with your triangle step
bvgs_-tnhvk_4-5-rgb_front so that left foot stays on the floor even though i am lifting my foot with every step
bvgs_-tnhvk_5-5-rgb_front right left right left that left foot does not move in space
bvgs_-tnhvk_6-5-rgb_front alright
bvgs_-tnhvk_7-5-rgb_front so you can practice that you can layer all sots of things on top of that and then when you are feeling comfortable you can start to pivot with it
bvgs_-tnhvk_8-5-rgb_front notice my left foot stays in the same place and my right foot is moving forward and back around that left foot
bvgs_-tnhvk_9-5-rgb_front right so this is a great movement when you do not have a lot of space to dance in but you want that illusion of movement
bwwv9mrgdvu_0-5-rgb_front before we get started we need to purchase our fabric
bwwv9mrgdvu_1-5-rgb_front and there is a few things to consider while you are buying your fabric
bwwv9mrgdvu_10-5-rgb_front and that will also have an effect on how much fabric you will be using
bwwv9mrgdvu_2-5-rgb_front the width of the fabric can come in different sizes
bwwv9mrgdvu_3-5-rgb_front the standard for upholstery fabric is usually inches wide
bwwv9mrgdvu_4-5-rgb_front but you can find fabrics that are inches wide or depending upon the fabrics
bwwv9mrgdvu_5-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that you take into account what width fabric you are buying to figure out how much you are going to need when you are estimating how much you are going to need for your couch
bwwv9mrgdvu_6-5-rgb_front now you also want to take into account the pattern
bwwv9mrgdvu_7-5-rgb_front now if you are using something where you are going to want to match patterns you will need more fabric
bwwv9mrgdvu_8-5-rgb_front you will need a lot of extra if you are matching
bwwv9mrgdvu_9-5-rgb_front you also want to think about how it is going to lay on the couch whether it is horizontal or vertical
bxa-8t_3mhs_0-8-rgb_front hey hi
bxa-8t_3mhs_1-8-rgb_front i am tim gipson
bxa-8t_3mhs_10-8-rgb_front there is a depth adjustment knob which is here and then there is also an angle lever here
bxa-8t_3mhs_11-8-rgb_front the angle will actually it controls the tilt of the blade to make sure that you are getting a nice even cut
bxa-8t_3mhs_12-8-rgb_front and we want to actually adjust this so that when we plane our board we actually get a paper thin shaving of wood off our our piece
bxa-8t_3mhs_13-8-rgb_front now when we are starting to plane we want to firmly hold the handle and the knob and when we start our stroke we want to make sure that the pressure is on the toe
bxa-8t_3mhs_14-8-rgb_front this keeps you from taking too big of a cut on your entrance
bxa-8t_3mhs_15-8-rgb_front and then when you finish your cut you are going to finish with your pressure on your heel
bxa-8t_3mhs_16-8-rgb_front and again that allows you to take a nice even cut
bxa-8t_3mhs_17-8-rgb_front and you want to make nice long even strokes when you do this
bxa-8t_3mhs_18-8-rgb_front okay
bxa-8t_3mhs_19-8-rgb_front so with a nice long even stroke you should be able to take and plane off a full section just like that
bxa-8t_3mhs_2-8-rgb_front i am going to talk to you about how you use a hand plane
bxa-8t_3mhs_20-8-rgb_front and the other thing to keep in mind is make sure that when you are the piece that you are planing that it is clamped in some kind of vice
bxa-8t_3mhs_21-8-rgb_front in this case i have got a table vice that i am using and i have actually got the piece where it is elevated just a little bit
bxa-8t_3mhs_22-8-rgb_front and help you in making sure that you make good cuts with your plane
bxa-8t_3mhs_23-8-rgb_front so i am tim gipson and that is how to use a hand plane
bxa-8t_3mhs_3-8-rgb_front now a hand plane is a very useful tool when you actually want to smooth out or take a curve out of the edge of the board
bxa-8t_3mhs_4-8-rgb_front typically you will do this when you want to take two boards such as this and you want to glue them up to make a larger panel
bxa-8t_3mhs_5-8-rgb_front now the important thing when you get ready to use a hand plane is on the blade you want to make sure you always start with a sharp blade
bxa-8t_3mhs_6-8-rgb_front so if it is recommended before you start using your plane that you take your blade and you hone it
bxa-8t_3mhs_7-8-rgb_front and you can hone it on any kind of a sharpening block with a little bit of oil which this one is ready to go
bxa-8t_3mhs_8-8-rgb_front now the next thing you want to do is you want to check the setting of your blade
bxa-8t_3mhs_9-8-rgb_front and the best way to do this is to actually look down your plane and there are two adjustment knobs
b_e7yfbqy_s_10-5-rgb_front i like the basic premise of
b_e7yfbqy_s_11-5-rgb_front so build upon it and add sleeves add a different neckline
b_e7yfbqy_s_12-5-rgb_front add anything that you want to add that makes it intrinsically yours and do not be afraid to try things ever
b_e7yfbqy_s_13-5-rgb_front no matter what anybody might say about it
b_e7yfbqy_s_14-5-rgb_front just do not be afraid
b_e7yfbqy_s_15-5-rgb_front do what you love
b_e7yfbqy_s_6-5-rgb_front what shape do i want my sleeves to be in
b_e7yfbqy_s_7-5-rgb_front a shape is just the jump off point for a design
b_e7yfbqy_s_8-5-rgb_front this is
b_e7yfbqy_s_9-5-rgb_front you decide i like the way that looks
b_tpirqm91w_0-8-rgb_front the last thing we need to do is the lips and then this look is complete
b_tpirqm91w_1-8-rgb_front again we are sticking with natural obviously so i am using a very very neutral lip liner
b_tpirqm91w_10-8-rgb_front if you have very small lips you can go a little over your natural lip line
b_tpirqm91w_11-8-rgb_front then you want to fill in the whole entire lip
b_tpirqm91w_12-8-rgb_front just kind of like you are drawing with a crayon
b_tpirqm91w_13-8-rgb_front the whole lip needs to be filled in with this color
b_tpirqm91w_14-8-rgb_front that is going to keep it looking blended
b_tpirqm91w_15-8-rgb_front it is going to keep your lipstick on longer
b_tpirqm91w_16-8-rgb_front it is going to take all the color out in your lips and we are going to create that very neutral lip look
b_tpirqm91w_2-8-rgb_front it is kind of a nude color
b_tpirqm91w_3-8-rgb_front very very neutral
b_tpirqm91w_4-8-rgb_front that is what you want to use
b_tpirqm91w_5-8-rgb_front you do not want to use anything that has too much color that is going to give too much definition or a line
b_tpirqm91w_6-8-rgb_front you want it to blend completely
b_tpirqm91w_7-8-rgb_front this is a nice creamy lip liner also so it is going to go on nice and smooth
b_tpirqm91w_8-8-rgb_front what you want to do is you want to line the entire lip
b_tpirqm91w_9-8-rgb_front just outline your natural lip line
b_ye00igi4w_0-5-rgb_front alright in this clip we are going to be drawing the kings robe
b_ye00igi4w_1-5-rgb_front i would say for this one go ahead and put away the old fine tip pen and break out if you have one something a little bit thicker
b_ye00igi4w_10-5-rgb_front we will come in here and add some details
b_ye00igi4w_11-5-rgb_front now make that robe flow a bit
b_ye00igi4w_12-5-rgb_front just add a few flowing lines
b_ye00igi4w_13-5-rgb_front move over here do the same and come up like this some real little flowing lines just like that to really just add character to the robe like that
b_ye00igi4w_14-5-rgb_front that is looking interesting
b_ye00igi4w_15-5-rgb_front like that
b_ye00igi4w_16-5-rgb_front okay that robe is looking pretty good i think
b_ye00igi4w_17-5-rgb_front so we have pretty much got the whole outfit done now for our king
b_ye00igi4w_18-5-rgb_front and what we will do in the last and final step is kind of go over this from head to toe and add the details that help really sell the picture
b_ye00igi4w_19-5-rgb_front so if you are all done with the robe let is go ahead and move on to the last little clip for the king
b_ye00igi4w_2-5-rgb_front i use the rectractable sharpie for these types of things
b_ye00igi4w_3-5-rgb_front and we are not going to draw anything too crazy nothing flowing really
b_ye00igi4w_4-5-rgb_front kind of come down like so
b_ye00igi4w_5-5-rgb_front we will make it comes all the way to the ground like that along this side really sort of call attention to it like right there
b_ye00igi4w_6-5-rgb_front now if we want to we can go in here and like create sort of a shadow like create a really big difference between the robe and the outer part of his clothes we can do that if we wanted to
b_ye00igi4w_7-5-rgb_front i will not go into too much detail there you kind of see what the possibilities are as far as that is concerned
b_ye00igi4w_8-5-rgb_front and what we will do actually we will make this robe sort of coming out to the side like this
b_ye00igi4w_9-5-rgb_front so now we will get the other pen again something a little less bold
bbbdxwo88-i_17-8-rgb_front now this really smooths out the skin
bbbdxwo88-i_18-8-rgb_front and you have to rub it in really good obviously because it looks like milk and you do not want to go out with anything white on you
bbbdxwo88-i_19-8-rgb_front and honestly you can rub it all over
bbbdxwo88-i_20-8-rgb_front and you will see in about minutes how smooth and soft your skin feels
bbbdxwo88-i_21-8-rgb_front every time i wear this and somebody touches my skin they say how soft it feels
bbbdxwo88-i_22-8-rgb_front so just rub it in really well
bbbdxwo88-i_23-8-rgb_front and you the great thing is also i mean you can use this on your lay back a little bit
bbbdxwo88-i_24-8-rgb_front you can rub it into your face as well
bbbdxwo88-i_25-8-rgb_front and it is not oily so you are not going to have any of that
bbbdxwo88-i_26-8-rgb_front it is just a nice soothing feel
bbbdxwo88-i_27-8-rgb_front i will show you an alternative to this as well
bbbdxwo88-i_28-8-rgb_front i love the milk products
bbbdxwo88-i_29-8-rgb_front here we go
bbbdxwo88-i_30-8-rgb_front i mean there are a lot of body creams out there and i am going to show you a couple of those also
bbbdxwo88-i_31-8-rgb_front but the reason why the milk is so great is because of the proteins and the vitamins in it that most of the lotions do not have
bbbdxwo88-i_32-8-rgb_front so make sure you get the milk
bbbdxwo88-i_33-8-rgb_front there are a couple of different variations you can get
bbbdxwo88-i_34-8-rgb_front go to your local beauty store
bbbdxwo88-i_35_36_37-8-rgb_front that milk product was only about so you can find them high end or low end just make sure when you read the back that it says proteins and vitamins a d and e in it
bbd_tfivek8_1-8-rgb_front if you have a piece of paper fold it like a fan in and out like this and hold it in the middle
bbd_tfivek8_2-8-rgb_front stretch it out so it looks like a bow we will start with the bad guy the lady and the hero
bbd_tfivek8_3-8-rgb_front you must pay the rent but i can not pay the rent you must pay the rent but i can not pay the rent you must pay the rent but i can not pay the rent i will pay the rent my hero curses foiled again

bbm3wyi7h8u_1-8-rgb_front so i am going to do is all the four basic punches together
bbm3wyi7h8u_10-8-rgb_front again jab and cross hook and up
bbm3wyi7h8u_11-8-rgb_front now when this goes pretty fast
bbm3wyi7h8u_12-8-rgb_front again if your doing this to music which is definitely a lot more fun
bbm3wyi7h8u_13-8-rgb_front if your doing this to music you want your feet to stomp with the music
bbm3wyi7h8u_14-8-rgb_front jab cross hook up
bbm3wyi7h8u_15-8-rgb_front jab cross hook up
bbm3wyi7h8u_16-8-rgb_front remember to keep those feet lifting up off the ground
bbm3wyi7h8u_17-8-rgb_front jab cross hook up
bbm3wyi7h8u_18-8-rgb_front you do not want them to ever stay planted
bbm3wyi7h8u_19-8-rgb_front remember the knees
bbm3wyi7h8u_2-8-rgb_front jab cross hook uppercut
bbm3wyi7h8u_20-8-rgb_front you do not want those to tweak
bbm3wyi7h8u_21-8-rgb_front so picking them up
bbm3wyi7h8u_22-8-rgb_front jab cross hook up
bbm3wyi7h8u_23-8-rgb_front jab cross hook up
bbm3wyi7h8u_24-8-rgb_front you want to make sure were picking the feet up
bbm3wyi7h8u_25-8-rgb_front cause again feet planted not so good
bbm3wyi7h8u_3-8-rgb_front so your going to get your guard up
bbm3wyi7h8u_4-8-rgb_front were prepped were ready to go
bbm3wyi7h8u_5-8-rgb_front start with a jab then we go into a cross
bbm3wyi7h8u_6-8-rgb_front then we go into a hook
bbm3wyi7h8u_7-8-rgb_front and then to an upper cut
bbm3wyi7h8u_8-8-rgb_front try it with a little tempo
bbm3wyi7h8u_9-8-rgb_front good jab and cross and hook and upper
bbd7zbjk9xc_0-8-rgb_front alright the drink we are about to make is called crocodile and let is go ahead and put our ice in a glass here and measure out one shot of melon liqueur for that crocodile green color
bbd7zbjk9xc_1-8-rgb_front and half a shot of bacardi limon
bbd7zbjk9xc_10-8-rgb_front bottoms up
bbd7zbjk9xc_2-8-rgb_front and next we will add fill the rest of the way with some soda
bbd7zbjk9xc_3-8-rgb_front there we go
bbd7zbjk9xc_4-8-rgb_front and we are just going to mix this up real well
bbd7zbjk9xc_5-8-rgb_front we got a nice crocodile green color
bbd7zbjk9xc_6-8-rgb_front get everything blended
bbd7zbjk9xc_7-8-rgb_front you do not want to shake this obviously with the carbonation in the soda you are going to have crocodile all over you
bbd7zbjk9xc_8-8-rgb_front and let is go ahead a get our glass here and we will dump the crocodile into the glass
bbd7zbjk9xc_9-8-rgb_front and i am going to dedicate this drink to the crocodile hunter and give a nice little crikey
bdmnuzr3wy4_0-11-rgb_front so here we have the harness and the harness is the lifeline between the person and the dog
bdmnuzr3wy4_1-11-rgb_front so here we have the harness and greg is going to show how the dog puts his head through the harness
bdmnuzr3wy4_2-11-rgb_front stay come on harness
bdmnuzr3wy4_3-11-rgb_front good
bdmnuzr3wy4_4-11-rgb_front wow
bdmnuzr3wy4_5-11-rgb_front so greg is put the harness on and then does the buckle up
bdmnuzr3wy4_6-11-rgb_front the handle then is obviously rigid so that the handler can feel which way the dog is going
bdmnuzr3wy4_7-11-rgb_front so a bit like the steering wheel of a car if you feel the dog pulling to the left then you follow the dog as quickly as you can and equally if it cuts across you to the right
bdwaasddu6q_2-8-rgb_front tool steel in other words what the type of steel the chisel is made out of is very important
bdwaasddu6q_3-8-rgb_front now in days we want to shoot for high speed steel
bdwaasddu6q_4-8-rgb_front and most the time you can see that if you look hopefully you can pick this up here but you will see high speed it will usually be stamped right on it
bdwaasddu6q_5-8-rgb_front now what that is is a specific type of tool steel that holds up very well to grinding
bdwaasddu6q_6-8-rgb_front in other words if you blew when you grind it if you blew the edge it will not lose it is temper that is probably the most important thing
bdwaasddu6q_7-8-rgb_front the next most important thing about high speed tool steel is that when it has good wear resistance on it
bdwaasddu6q_8-8-rgb_front now the tools that we have probably or years ago if you have got some that are that old and it is not hard to have because if you have kept a lathe for a number of years you usually had a set of tools it came with carbon steel
bda6fyaifgg_10-8-rgb_front and this material it is a plunge bra and this material on this bra is again silky smooth
bda6fyaifgg_11-8-rgb_front it comes in a variety of colors and again wonderful underneath a a sweater you name it
bda6fyaifgg_3-8-rgb_front this is what we typically call a bra and just a great all over fit and coverage
bda6fyaifgg_4-8-rgb_front and again the material is really what makes this so special because it is so smooth
bda6fyaifgg_5-8-rgb_front and secondly we have another basic bra again but this time it is just in cotton
bda6fyaifgg_6-8-rgb_front and again it is a plunge bra and it has the underwire and no padding
bda6fyaifgg_7-8-rgb_front and you know it just is really good underneath as well but it is probably our second choice recommendation
bda6fyaifgg_8-8-rgb_front and then third we have again another what we call bra but this time it does not have any underwire
bda6fyaifgg_9-8-rgb_front a lot of our customers more and more frequently request a bra that does not have underwire but this does give the support that people need because of the band underneath the breast it is sewn in such a way so that you do get the support you need without underwire
bf5cypgopw8_0-4-rgb_front alright let is talk about aperture priority mode on the canon
bf5cypgopw8_1-4-rgb_front this is one of the creative zone modes that is available on your dial on your mode dial over here
bf5cypgopw8_10-4-rgb_front if i scroll the other direction to decrease the aperture it it is kind of tricky because when you increase your aperture or when your decrease your aperture making it a smaller hole making less light come into the camera
bf5cypgopw8_11-4-rgb_front the number that indicates that aperture actually increases so it is they are a they are kind of opposite
bf5cypgopw8_12-4-rgb_front so i am scrolling up here through larger numbers for aperture
bf5cypgopw8_19-4-rgb_front so i am going to go ahead and leave my aperture there
bf5cypgopw8_2-4-rgb_front on the top of the camera on the left side if you turn the dial right now we are in shutter priority mode or t v
bf5cypgopw8_20-4-rgb_front press the shutter half way down and go ahead and take the shot and that will give me a appropriate exposure
bf5cypgopw8_21-4-rgb_front there was not any blinking on my shutter setting
bf5cypgopw8_22-4-rgb_front so yeah check it out
bf5cypgopw8_3-4-rgb_front mode and what we are going to do is turn the dial clockwise and now we are set to aperture priority mode which is indicated by upper case a lower case v right next to a white marking on the top of the body there
bf5cypgopw8_4-4-rgb_front this mode basically allows the user control of the aperture in order to maintain a depth of field that is appropriate for the subject and what what it does is gives you it gives you the ability to manually set the aperture on your camera and the way to do that is by focusing your camera on the subject press the shutter button half way down and your camera will give you a aperture setting and a shutter speed setting and to change the aperture setting in aperture priority mode what you need to do is hold down the shutter half way and then scroll to the right or to the left with the main control dial
bf5cypgopw8_5-4-rgb_front by scrolling to the left i am increasing the aperture
bf5cypgopw8_6-4-rgb_front the maximum aperture that i have on this camera with a millimeter lens is a f stop
bf5cypgopw8_7-4-rgb_front that is the widest or the most light i can let into the camera and at this setting the depth of field will be very very small
bf5cypgopw8_8-4-rgb_front i mean really razor thin millimeter
bf5cypgopw8_9-4-rgb_front somebody is the tip of somebody is nose at f stop and you can see right now on my lcd screen that i will actually achieve a i am i am able to achieve a appropriate exposure because the shutter speed automatically compensates to only five hundred one five hundredths of a second and that should give me the appropriate exposure
bfs0s717ykq_0-2-rgb_front hi my name is lauren and today i am going to go over how to keep from going bald
bfs0s717ykq_1-2-rgb_front there are many things that you can do within today is society in order to maintain the hair that you have in order to keep it

bh1nzi3bhmq_0-8-rgb_front for you folks out there thinking about buying a telescope for your own use or the use of your children or whatever
bh1nzi3bhmq_1-8-rgb_front i often recommend a small refractor such as this
bh1nzi3bhmq_2-8-rgb_front it has a objective lens in the front to guide as a light
bh1nzi3bhmq_3-8-rgb_front an eye piece back here that magnifies light
bh1nzi3bhmq_4-8-rgb_front it also has what we call a star diagonal so that when you are looking up in the sky you are not straining your neck too much
bibfhsdmhrm_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is jessica claire and i am a dating coach for new york dating coach and we are here in new york city
bibfhsdmhrm_10-5-rgb_front secondly she will lean in or show herself off
bibfhsdmhrm_11-5-rgb_front she might open her arms wider or touch her hair or touch her body or her face
bibfhsdmhrm_12-5-rgb_front either way if she is touching herself and she is close to you it is almost always true that she is interested
bibfhsdmhrm_13-5-rgb_front how to know if she is not interested
bibfhsdmhrm_14-5-rgb_front she will walk away

biixqhnupo8_0-5-rgb_front underwear is really really important when you are backpacking it is really really important to know not to bring cotton underwear
biixqhnupo8_1-5-rgb_front if you bring cotton underwear in addition to it if it gets wet because of raining or whatever a it is going to stay wet
biixqhnupo8_2-5-rgb_front and you also have the problem of potential chaffing because you are walking a lot of miles every day and so that could cause some real discomfort
bijxdwaiue8_1-8-rgb_front in this clip i am going to show you a great resource on the internet for your family and it is called igoogle
bijxdwaiue8_10-8-rgb_front we also can add a page for our child where they can add different games and things to their page as well
bijxdwaiue8_11-8-rgb_front once we have this all customized and set up the way we want it this would be a good page to save as your homepage so that your child is direct to this page every time they get on the internet
bijxdwaiue8_2-8-rgb_front so we go to the internet and we type in www igoogle com
bijxdwaiue8_3-8-rgb_front they have set up a web page that you can customize to your own and then save it and put a password on it so you and your family can access it
bijxdwaiue8_4-8-rgb_front once we are here we are going to go to make it your own
bijxdwaiue8_5-8-rgb_front so we are going to click on that and now it is going to let us decide what we want on our google page on our igoogle
bijxdwaiue8_6-8-rgb_front i would like the calendar and i like the weather but for my kids i do not want all the news popping up because some of that is not child friendly
bijxdwaiue8_7-8-rgb_front but i do want to add bookmarks and this is going to let us save our kids websites links to their websites on this page
bijxdwaiue8_8-8-rgb_front once i have clicked on what i do want and do not want i click show my page
bijxdwaiue8_9-8-rgb_front now our page is very basic here but it just has a place for us to add bookmarks has a our calendar and our weather
bj2wvqtqr_q_0-8-rgb_front now we got to take the slack out of this cable
bj2wvqtqr_q_1-8-rgb_front remember we put the pin down to engage the winch we want to pull the cable
bj2wvqtqr_q_2-8-rgb_front make sure you keep your hands fingers or anything away from this area or it will pull your fingers in right with it
bj2wvqtqr_q_3-8-rgb_front pushing the button up it is going to pull the cable in we are just going to get the cable so it is tight not with a lot of pressure on but there is not any slack in the line
bj2wvqtqr_q_4-8-rgb_front and then we are going to take the vehicle out of drive put it into neutral we want to leave the key forward so we can steer the vehicle to make sure we get it centered on the trailer properly
bj2wvqtqr_q_5-8-rgb_front and then we are ready to winch it up
bj2wvqtqr_q_6-8-rgb_front now as we are pulling the vehicle onto the trailer until the trailer the vehicle starts going up the ramp there might be a little slack in the cable
bj2wvqtqr_q_7-8-rgb_front you might want to do the same thing have gloves on just kind of hold the cable keep it taught as you start pulling it up
bkdszdsqle0_10-4-rgb_front it should feel like a nice relaxed stretch
bkdszdsqle0_11-4-rgb_front so and to come back up i am just going to stand back up on my leg
bkdszdsqle0_12-4-rgb_front that is a runner is stretch in the modern dance style
blhcuryvt88_11-8-rgb_front and then you are simply going to push down into the pot
blhcuryvt88_12-8-rgb_front you are going to want to get a little bit of water in that
blhcuryvt88_13_14_15-8-rgb_front to reduce your friction and you are going to push down so you have about half an inch on the bottom of the pot
blhcuryvt88_16_17_18-8-rgb_front now this is this is something why you just kind of learn where that is it is a trial and error process
blhcuryvt88_19-8-rgb_front but once you get good at it you will just be able to push down
blhcuryvt88_20-8-rgb_front and you will know pretty much where you are
blhcuryvt88_21-8-rgb_front now the next step is opening the form
blhcuryvt88_22-8-rgb_front and we do that with what is called the claw
blhcuryvt88_23-8-rgb_front and you use your hand like this
blhcuryvt88_24-8-rgb_front and you put it inside the pot
blhcuryvt88_25-8-rgb_front and what i am going to be doing is pushing down
blhcuryvt88_26-8-rgb_front and pulling towards me
blhcuryvt88_27-8-rgb_front and this is going to open the form and create the base of the pot
blhcuryvt88_28-8-rgb_front and so here we go
blhcuryvt88_29-8-rgb_front you just pull out and down
blhcuryvt88_30-8-rgb_front you can see how that clay is just being forced into the position
blhcuryvt88_31-8-rgb_front now on a plant pot the inside here needs to be pretty wide
blhcuryvt88_32-8-rgb_front because you want a nice base for the pot to sit on
blhcuryvt88_33-8-rgb_front so part of opening the pot is forming your inside of your pot
blhcuryvt88_34-8-rgb_front in this case a plant pot
blhcuryvt88_35-8-rgb_front and you know i use this finger here
blhcuryvt88_36-8-rgb_front as i am gripping to create a nice edge on the inside
blhcuryvt88_37-8-rgb_front and there we go
blhcuryvt88_38-8-rgb_front we have now we have entered and opened this form
blhcuryvt88_39-8-rgb_front and the next part of what we are going to do is pulling the clay up into the walls
blhcuryvt88_40-8-rgb_front and then we are going to shape the pot
blhcuryvt88_41-8-rgb_front and we are going to show you that next
blsy_rv3ya0_2-8-rgb_front if you have a machine that is broken or not working properly the two choices you have are to either not use the tool or to get it fixed
blsy_rv3ya0_3-8-rgb_front before you use any tool you want to thoroughly inspect the cord the cord is the lifeline of your tool it will keep you from getting injured and it will make sure that your tool is working properly
blsy_rv3ya0_4-8-rgb_front and lastly before you use any tool you want to make sure that the guards are properly placed and in good working condition for the tool that you are going to be working on
bmqrsbus5e0_0-5-rgb_front now a sheet bend is another bend that we can put into a rope
bmqrsbus5e0_1-5-rgb_front once again a bend is a rope that are not that you tie into a rope that is easy to untie because most times when you put a knot in there you really can not untie them too well
bmqrsbus5e0_2-5-rgb_front the problem with a sheet bend is that it does reduce the strength of the rope by percent or the strength of the line by percent
bmqrsbus5e0_3-5-rgb_front and it also not good though if you have a sudden jerk it will come loose
bmqrsbus5e0_4-5-rgb_front so just remember that whenever you are tying this one
bmqrsbus5e0_5-5-rgb_front if you look down here at the table you can see that i have a rope here my blue line comes in i have already made a loop in it here
bmqrsbus5e0_6-5-rgb_front i am just going to pull these two ropes together to make this loop a little more pizzazz
bmqrsbus5e0_7-5-rgb_front and i am going to take the working end of my red rope and it is going to go under in here
bmqrsbus5e0_8-5-rgb_front then i m going to take it over the outside line like so
bmqrsbus5e0_9-5-rgb_front and just loop it back under my loop and over and through like so
bnm6qaaj6qo_10-3-rgb_front now there is an image of this half face on that dvd
bnm6qaaj6qo_11-3-rgb_front i could cut that out more so as a square like it is shown on that painting up there
bnm6qaaj6qo_12-3-rgb_front and then on top of that i could take some heavy embossing powder and i could melt it in a melting pot like this here
bnm6qaaj6qo_13-3-rgb_front and once it was all melted i could take the melted fluid and pour it on top of the dvd to create a totally different effect on top and then i set that into the painting
bnm6qaaj6qo_14-3-rgb_front so that is just one of the many effects on this painting that i thought i would talk to you about
bnm6qaaj6qo_3-3-rgb_front and i thought i would just show you a couple ideas that i have in there
bnm6qaaj6qo_4-3-rgb_front for one it is got a lot of gels transparent gels that i have painted on top of the wax and they come in art stores is transparent then there is marbled effects on the different gels and i have used that painted it on top of the wax and on some cases there i have actually dusted that when it was wet with some metallic powders just to get some different looks
bnm6qaaj6qo_5-3-rgb_front so this is one thing that is in there
bnm6qaaj6qo_6-3-rgb_front another thing that is kind of interesting is that i took a dvd like this
bnm6qaaj6qo_7-3-rgb_front i took an embossing gun and i heated the dvd and once you heat that dvd you can then take a pair of scissors and actually cut that dvd up like that
bnm6qaaj6qo_8-3-rgb_front so once you have a piece of that dvd cut out you could then take a rubber stamp
bnm6qaaj6qo_9-3-rgb_front and you could stamp an image on that dvd like this
bobx1pdyfog_0-8-rgb_front the very first cast we are going to cover is the roll cast
bobx1pdyfog_1-8-rgb_front and the reason why we have a roll cast and how it got it is name is the cast occurs because the line is rolling along the water
bobx1pdyfog_10-8-rgb_front the other thing that the roll cast does for you it builds upon how the line and the rod relationship work
bobx1pdyfog_11-8-rgb_front and what it amounts to is every cast starts out with a tempo or a speed
bobx1pdyfog_12-8-rgb_front so you start out slow you go medium and then you finish with a quick stroke
bobx1pdyfog_13-8-rgb_front so that enables the line to transfer the energy to the rod and then with the stop the line goes off the end
bobx1pdyfog_14-8-rgb_front so it is slow medium quick to a stop
bobx1pdyfog_15-8-rgb_front now i mentioned the word stop
bobx1pdyfog_16-8-rgb_front stop is where the transfers of energy occurs off of the rod tip and then that by stopping the rod the line pivots off the end and keeps going
bobx1pdyfog_17-8-rgb_front the stop is one of the most important things in a fly cast
bobx1pdyfog_18-8-rgb_front so now let is cover the basics and build upon the roll cast
bobx1pdyfog_19-8-rgb_front i might also mention that a lot of people think that they should cover the overhead cast first
bobx1pdyfog_2-8-rgb_front in this case we will build and demonstrate using the example of the grass
bobx1pdyfog_20-8-rgb_front well the overhead cast it gets to a back cast and a forward cast so you are learning two things
bobx1pdyfog_21-8-rgb_front that is why i think it is so important to cover the roll cast first
bobx1pdyfog_22-8-rgb_front so you understand the speed of the cast and the importance of the stop
bobx1pdyfog_23-8-rgb_front so now let is build upon that and start our demonstration
bobx1pdyfog_24-8-rgb_front the basis of every cast is every cast needs to start with the tip down
bobx1pdyfog_25-8-rgb_front the reason that the reason why that is so important is because as you begin to lift the rod up the line will begin to bend the tip of the rod
bobx1pdyfog_26-8-rgb_front so every cast no matter what cast you start should begin with the tip in the water or in this case on the ground
bobx1pdyfog_27-8-rgb_front the lift is one of the most important things that goes into every single cast
bobx1pdyfog_28-8-rgb_front so what we are going to do is we are going to lift our arms straight like this here and then what we are going to do is we are going to bring the rod back
bobx1pdyfog_29-8-rgb_front if you bring the rod back then essentially the line will begin to load from the rod coming back
bobx1pdyfog_3-8-rgb_front also what the roll cast provides is the opportunity to cast and fish when there is bushes or obstructions behind you or along side of you you can still fish
bobx1pdyfog_30-8-rgb_front now what we are going to do as we lift it back to this position what we are going to do is we are going to slide the line back behind us
bobx1pdyfog_31-8-rgb_front did you see how i slid it back
bobx1pdyfog_32-8-rgb_front sliding back is the most important thing
bobx1pdyfog_33-8-rgb_front essentially if you raise it up then the wind could catch it and put your fly right back into the bushes
bobx1pdyfog_34-8-rgb_front so now we are in to what you would call the key position for setting up the roll cast
bobx1pdyfog_35-8-rgb_front you will notice here that the distance between the rod and my forearm or wrist is degrees
bobx1pdyfog_36-8-rgb_front that enables a nice casting stroke
bobx1pdyfog_37-8-rgb_front you start out slow we go medium and then we finish fast and the line goes out
bobx1pdyfog_38-8-rgb_front okay now i will just pick up the tempo so you can see this
bobx1pdyfog_39-8-rgb_front there is a lift it comes back it goes up in to the key position there is your slow medium quick and the cast goes out
bobx1pdyfog_4-8-rgb_front where is if you only learn the overhead cast first which the line goes up in the air behind you you can see what happens is the line would go right up in the bushes and you would have to essentially spend the money to get another fly you take the time you would lose your leader and everything else
bobx1pdyfog_40-8-rgb_front what you notice there is the smoothness that occurs in the cast and how i transitioned my weight
bobx1pdyfog_41-8-rgb_front first from the back foot into the forward foot
bobx1pdyfog_42-8-rgb_front lift back the rod comes up to the degree position the upper arms is level now we will do the cast
bobx1pdyfog_43-8-rgb_front what you will notice is that i go into the cast from the back position to the slow to the forward
bobx1pdyfog_44-8-rgb_front now this degree angle maintains as we go into the casting stroke
bobx1pdyfog_45-8-rgb_front so now we have the slow the medium now what we are going to do we are going to finish with a flick of the wrist and that will send the line on its way
bobx1pdyfog_46-8-rgb_front flick
bobx1pdyfog_47-8-rgb_front see it go on its way
bobx1pdyfog_48-8-rgb_front okay
bobx1pdyfog_49-8-rgb_front that is the basics of the good roll cast
bobx1pdyfog_5-8-rgb_front so to properly learn the roll cast is one of the most advantages that you have
bobx1pdyfog_6-8-rgb_front in fact as a guide and outfitter i can tell you from talking to fellow guides is most people on guide trips do not even know what the roll cast is
bobx1pdyfog_7-8-rgb_front seventy percent do not
bobx1pdyfog_8-8-rgb_front okay
bobx1pdyfog_9-8-rgb_front so what we are going to do is we are going to start out with the roll cast because what the roll cast provides for you is the forward movement of every single cast
bpydl3ao4b8_0-1-rgb_front o k
bpydl3ao4b8_1-1-rgb_front so we are throwing a corked bottle today and the first step of throwing a corked bottle here is our cork here
bpydl3ao4b8_2-1-rgb_front the first step is to center the clay
bpydl3ao4b8_25-1-rgb_front i am now just going to take one of these rib tools we talked about earlier with a right angled edge and i am just going to trim any excess off the base of the centered lump of clay
bpydl3ao4b8_26-1-rgb_front o k so now we have the lump of clay centered
bpydl3ao4b8_27-1-rgb_front the next part of the process in throwing our corked bottle is going to be entering the clay and opening the pot
bpydl3ao4b8_28-1-rgb_front and we are going to do that in the next segment
bpydl3ao4b8_3-1-rgb_front now what i like to do first is get some water on my piece of clay
bpydl3ao4b8_4-1-rgb_front this makes the hands slide over it nice and easily like that
bpydl3ao4b8_5-1-rgb_front the next thing i like to do is simply push the clay down on to the bat just to make sure i have it nice and secure on there
bpydl3ao4b8_6-1-rgb_front you certainly do not want this piece of clay moving around
bpydl3ao4b8_7-1-rgb_front so i just push down with this hand hold it in place with this and simply push it down on to the bat
bpzeif6vvum_0-5-rgb_front the next thing to consider is the type of life vest that you are going to be using
bpzeif6vvum_1-5-rgb_front you want one that will fit snuggly around your chest so it does not ride up on you when you are in the water
bpzeif6vvum_10-5-rgb_front it is a smaller vest but it fastens the same way with the clips
bpzeif6vvum_11-5-rgb_front it is just a little bit easier they are a little smaller
bpzeif6vvum_12-5-rgb_front it is the same type of thing pfd approved
bpzeif6vvum_13-5-rgb_front it is something that needs to be cleaned up a little bit
bpzeif6vvum_2-5-rgb_front it also has to be a pfd coast guard approved life vest
bpzeif6vvum_3-5-rgb_front this one here has a zipper and clips as well
bpzeif6vvum_4-5-rgb_front the clips fit securely in and keep it from riding up on you
bpzeif6vvum_5-5-rgb_front it is available in a variety of colors it is just a personal preference
bpzeif6vvum_6-5-rgb_front for those of you in salt water the life you want to rinse it with clean fresh water
bpzeif6vvum_7-5-rgb_front the salt water is like acid it will eat right through the fabric
bpzeif6vvum_8-5-rgb_front again you want to store this in a dry shady area indoors preferably
bpzeif6vvum_9-5-rgb_front this particular life vest is for a child
bq-ogbcmc5c_0-3-rgb_front as you saw when i showed you the wall there is many many colors to choose from
bq-ogbcmc5c_1-3-rgb_front although you may have a yellow room and you put this yellow frame down on this picture it just does not work
bq-ogbcmc5c_2-3-rgb_front the color you need to think about your colors when you are picking a picture
bq-ogbcmc5c_3-3-rgb_front the best way to do that is to pull it down through here if you see the frame more than what you see the picture then you probably know that you have the wrong frame
bq-ogbcmc5c_4-3-rgb_front as i pull these down through here you see only the frame you hardly see the picture at all
bq-ogbcmc5c_5-3-rgb_front to where if i put this one here you start to see these colors that are in the picture and you see the frame but you see the picture more
bq-ogbcmc5c_6-3-rgb_front the picture has no gold in it but that little bit of gold if you have gold in your room that will help pull your room back together that is a very nice look on this picture
bq-ogbcmc5c_7-3-rgb_front it dresses it up quite nicely without going overboard without going too modern or up to date
bq-ogbcmc5c_8-3-rgb_front this kind of gives it a rustic country feel so therefore that is why it works better
brintpjvezy_0-3-rgb_front sheryl mcglochlin hi
brintpjvezy_10-3-rgb_front if you were to just keep fire in there your your campfire would go out pretty quick
brintpjvezy_11-3-rgb_front so you do want to make sure you have got logs in there and they will start to catch on fire soon
brintpjvezy_2-3-rgb_front we have added logs we are going to add a little bit more kindling and we are going to go ahead and light a match and we are just going to make sure we kind of get this thing going a little bit and then we will be able to add more logs as we do this
brintpjvezy_3-3-rgb_front so oscar go ahead and light a match and let is see if we can actually make a fire going
brintpjvezy_4-3-rgb_front you know there is going to be different weather conditions that play a factor in this also
brintpjvezy_5-3-rgb_front if there is a lot of wind then this shape that i have right now this container is going to help a lot because wind will blow out your fire faster than anything and you want to make sure that you get that fire started and that is where the kindling and the newspaper were heading
brintpjvezy_6-3-rgb_front let me going to go ahead and get this match started
brintpjvezy_7-3-rgb_front we are going to start it in a couple of different places
brintpjvezy_8-3-rgb_front some people think that they can just keep a fire going with just paper
brintpjvezy_9-3-rgb_front but that is not the case
bsn-7bofxx4_0-3-rgb_front you have been in a situation where someone is called on to give a speech and it is obvious they have not thought about where they are going with their words
bsn-7bofxx4_1-3-rgb_front they go all over the place
bsn-7bofxx4_10-3-rgb_front that is not an airplane flight
bsn-7bofxx4_11-3-rgb_front you want a nice smooth take off and you get up to your altitude and then it is not uncommon for a plane to make or course corrections as they vector to one place and then they vector over to this one and then they finally land nice and smoothly
bsn-7bofxx4_12-3-rgb_front that is what a good speech does whether you are only speaking for minutes or you have minutes
bsn-7bofxx4_13-3-rgb_front think of terms of an airplane flight
bsn-7bofxx4_14-3-rgb_front get a nice smooth beginning that is your introduction or points of the flight in a nice nice landing
bsn-7bofxx4_15-3-rgb_front when you keep that in mind you can make a great speech and i will show you how to put those parts together
bsn-7bofxx4_2-3-rgb_front they bring in or different ideas they try some humor that does not land home and then they kind of crash and burn
bsn-7bofxx4_3-3-rgb_front i have learned that there is a simple metaphor
bsn-7bofxx4_4-3-rgb_front if you keep this in mind when you have to make a speech whether you have months to prepare for it or minutes this will help you really make it go smoothly
bsn-7bofxx4_5_6_7-3-rgb_front think in terms of a speech like an airplane flight all airplane flight have basic parts to them they have a take off they have a flight and they have a nice smooth landing
bsn-7bofxx4_8-3-rgb_front now here is what you do not want on an airplane flight
bsn-7bofxx4_9-3-rgb_front you do not want them going all over the place down a runway and all of a sudden they fire up in the air and then they jerk you all around in this flight and then they crash land
bsir_mledvc_0-5-rgb_front talk about how to set the drag on the reel on your jig rod now and this is a very very important thing that not a lot of people always think about but it is imperative to not only hooking fish but also landing then effectively and really all the drag is
bsir_mledvc_1-5-rgb_front is determining how much tension is on is on that reel
bsir_mledvc_2-5-rgb_front how easy it is for a fish to take out the line and with most basic models the way to set the drag is actually right here on top of the reel and you just turn this clockwise to tighten the drag and counter clockwise to loosen the drag
bsir_mledvc_3-5-rgb_front occasionally your reels might have their drag setting on the back but what i like to do is start with it at a low setting and you can hear the drag and when it is easy to pull out like that
bsir_mledvc_4-5-rgb_front that to me is too loose you want start to click that up a little bit
bsir_mledvc_5-5-rgb_front tighten it up a bit test it some more
bsir_mledvc_6-5-rgb_front you want to be able to just pull out an inch or two of line with enough firm pressure
bsir_mledvc_7-5-rgb_front so that if you do get a big fish the fish is able to take line easily without breaking your line but at the same time it is not so easy that you can not not set the hook on the fish
bsqksfnvdc0_0-8-rgb_front hello i am sifu mallon with the clearwater kung fu center
bsqksfnvdc0_1-8-rgb_front this is my assistant melissa and this is women is self defense
bsqksfnvdc0_10-8-rgb_front she neutralizes by pulling the inside hand down
bsqksfnvdc0_11-8-rgb_front okay she steps back she groin strikes one two lift punch
bsqksfnvdc0_12-8-rgb_front now this push this wedge push as it is coming up is going to come from here and it is going to be more of not like a touch and shove but more like a jab quick strike
bsqksfnvdc0_13-8-rgb_front this is how we do women is self defense
bsqksfnvdc0_2-8-rgb_front this self defense tactic is going against the hold
bsqksfnvdc0_3-8-rgb_front this is called front head hold so meaning i have got her head in a lock in front of the body
bsqksfnvdc0_4-8-rgb_front so what she is going to do is the first thing she is going to do is she is going to neutralize this
bsqksfnvdc0_5-8-rgb_front she is going to use the free hand and she is going to grab and pull down on my forearm so i can not lift and get my arch and choke her this way
bsqksfnvdc0_6-8-rgb_front now as she does this she steps back getting a nice base and now she is going to fire two one two fast groin strikes then she is going to open her hand and do what is called the wedge strike
bsqksfnvdc0_7-8-rgb_front a wedge strike is where you are using the inside web or the wedge of your hand this way
bsqksfnvdc0_8-8-rgb_front she is going to straight up this way push and lift that way
bsqksfnvdc0_9-8-rgb_front again so i come forward i attack this way grabbing her head
bt24oqg3gha_0-3-rgb_front hi this is phillip toriello and this is how to do the flip turn while doing your backstroke
bt24oqg3gha_1-3-rgb_front the preparation of the backstroke begins once you see the backstroke flags hanging approximately five yards from the wall
bt24oqg3gha_2-3-rgb_front the reason why they are there is to go ahead and indicate that the wall is coming up to spare you any sort of injury to your head and your fingers
bt24oqg3gha_3-3-rgb_front people have jammed their fingers plenty on those walls and have bumped their heads
bt24oqg3gha_4-3-rgb_front so once you see those flags you are going to you are going to go ahead and work with the approximate five strokes from the wall and on that fifth stroke you are going to go ahead and rotate onto your belly pull one freestyle pull into your somersault or your freestyle flip turn plant those feet like we talked about before push off in a streamline fashion and stay on your back
bt24oqg3gha_5-3-rgb_front give yourself a couple dolphin kicks to propel you through the water and after about the third dolphin kick surface and go right back into your thumb out pinkie in bend that elbow and push
bt24oqg3gha_6-3-rgb_front for more questions on backstroke and backstroke flip turns please contact your local swimming expert

bu1-_fpoq3q_2-3-rgb_front so just starting and fitting it into the space
bu1-_fpoq3q_3-3-rgb_front the second stroke is the cap
bu1-_fpoq3q_4-3-rgb_front and the third stroke i am going to come down here i am going to turn my pen just a little bit and i am going to pull a dagger stroke it is called
bu1-_fpoq3q_5-3-rgb_front and we are going to talk about those dagger strokes a bit more a little further along because they are characteristic
bu1-_fpoq3q_6-3-rgb_front what i am doing is i am twisting the pen as i pull it down
bu1-_fpoq3q_7-3-rgb_front but do not worry if you do not quite get that movement you can also make a stroke like that with a g another g is to make a closed g very much like the letter a and bring a tail down here
bubhhm2a0bw_0-8-rgb_front now let is talk about the use of honey in natural facial cleansers
bubhhm2a0bw_1-8-rgb_front honey is a natural antiseptic and research has also found it to be a natural antibacterial agent
bubhhm2a0bw_10-8-rgb_front milk can be very softening and soothing
bubhhm2a0bw_11-8-rgb_front it is also very hydrating
bubhhm2a0bw_12-8-rgb_front the vitamins a and d that can be found in milk are good for you complexion
bubhhm2a0bw_13-8-rgb_front in fact cleopatra was known to soak in milk baths to help her complexion

bubhhm2a0bw_6-8-rgb_front honey can be moisturizing soothing and softening and the sugar in honey also helps to gently to remove some of the dead skin
bubhhm2a0bw_7-8-rgb_front honey can be an allergen to some people but you can reduced this allergic reaction by buying organic local honey
bubhhm2a0bw_8-8-rgb_front the reason for this is that you are already used to the local pollens in the air and the bees use those to create the honey
bubhhm2a0bw_9-8-rgb_front now let is talk about the use of milk in facial cleansers

c5tmjxremum_1-8-rgb_front a lot of the time i hear that complaint
c5tmjxremum_2-8-rgb_front i am laura gibson hair expert and i am here to teach you about fine hair and curling irons
c5tmjxremum_3-8-rgb_front curling iron is usually a good option to give your hair some texture but it can also be very dangerous
c5tmjxremum_4-8-rgb_front sometimes you do not know and its oops my hair is burnt i do not know what to do
c5tmjxremum_5-8-rgb_front well i can help you avoid that
c5tmjxremum_6-8-rgb_front so what you are going to want to do is when you go to shop for a curling iron make sure it has a temperature gauge and if your hair is super fine you are going to want to keep it at a low temperature because you do not really need all that heat
c5tmjxremum_7-8-rgb_front it is just going to fry your hair
c5tmjxremum_8-8-rgb_front fine hair tends to be a little more sensitive than someone with thick coarse hair like mine
c5uhp1honls_0-8-rgb_front johnny miles in this clip i am going to talk about a great drill to do in a bunker to practice your bunker shots
c5uhp1honls_1-8-rgb_front seeing all you are trying to do is get the ball to come out on a cushion of sand you need to take your focus away from the ball and get it onto the sand where you are just splashing the sand out from underneath the ball
c5uhp1honls_2-8-rgb_front one of the best drills i know for it is a just draw a line in the sand with your club and put a couple of golf balls at the far end of that line
c5uhp1honls_3-8-rgb_front get set up to the line like there was a ball there and focusing on the line dig your feet in a little bit and just splash the sand out with the club entering the sand right around the line
c5uhp1honls_4-8-rgb_front do that a couple of times for practice
c5uhp1honls_5-8-rgb_front and then when you get to the ball do not focus on the ball just look at the line and splash the sand off
c5uhp1honls_6-8-rgb_front just splash the sand off
c5uhp1honls_7-8-rgb_front interviewer that takes your mental look off the ball
c5uhp1honls_8-8-rgb_front david anderson that takes your focus off of the golf ball puts it onto the sand and you splashing the sand out from underneath the ball and that is what gets the ball onto the green
c6pujuccuwk_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is lauren and today i am here to discuss how to bond human hair
c6pujuccuwk_1-5-rgb_front there are two types of extensions that you can use synthetic which will probably be your least expensive however not as durable as your natural hair your natural hair extensions are made of the same keratin proteins that your hair is actually made of and can undergo the same thermal tools and styling that your natural hair can go through
c6pujuccuwk_2-5-rgb_front bonding you can either use a glue or a wax and what you are going to do is you are going to grab a small section of hair and then add your piece up at the root of your hair then they use protein bonds or glues in order to bond that part to the rest of your hair
c6pujuccuwk_3-5-rgb_front so it is bonded by the root of your hair and then you can actually either add length to your own natural hair or you can add volume to your natural hair
c6pujuccuwk_4-5-rgb_front the actual process of bonding because of the size of the sections you are taking which are very very small you are going to take very small bunches of hair in order to create that bond it is a very time consuming process and it will probably take anywhere from three to five hours in order to do your entire head to get the desired length that you need or the desired amount of volume that you need
c6pujuccuwk_5-5-rgb_front another thing that is to know about bonding hair is that you are to have an upkeep with bonding hair
c6pujuccuwk_6-5-rgb_front you will probably every like two to three months have to go back to your stylist have some of those bonds removed and then replace the hair
c6pujuccuwk_7-5-rgb_front as your hair grows those bonds also grow down your hair shaft so you do need to replace them and there is a good amount of upkeep and maintenance involved
c6pujuccuwk_8-5-rgb_front that is how to bond natural hair
c6ywtoqtmmk_0-5-rgb_front getting someone back in the boat midstream or on some flat water without taking the machine to shore it is something that you may need to do on larger bigger volume rivers where you may not be able to get them to shore in time for the next rapid or if you are in just a large body of water and you need to get them back in otherwise taking them to shore is going to take up too much energy and time
c6ywtoqtmmk_1-5-rgb_front when you are doing this make sure that you have got the swimmer is full cooperation
c6ywtoqtmmk_2-5-rgb_front if they are panicking in any way you are going to need to calm them down before hand and that could take some time
c6ywtoqtmmk_3-5-rgb_front once you have got them to the side of the boat you are going to empty the boat over the cockpit of yours just like we did in the last shoot and then you are going to take that person and they are going to take the grab loop of that spray skirt put it in their teeth so that it does not catch on to their end of their boat and then they are going to climb up the back of their boat while you are holding onto the front of the boat to keep it steady
c6ywtoqtmmk_4-5-rgb_front at which point keeping their weight low they will straddle the boat slide into the cockpit and you can get them back in passing their paddle and you are off and away
c6xuomqgrxw_0-8-rgb_front my name is abby jones and i am talking about the process of moving into a new space and right now we are talking about moving into and organizing your new kitchen and specifically right now where i am keeping my cutting boards and where are good places to keep your cutting boards
c6xuomqgrxw_1-8-rgb_front i have several cutting boards and some of them i use more often than others and that is going to be the main factor in determining where i keep each cutting board
c6xuomqgrxw_11-8-rgb_front i really use the the smaller ones that are easy to put away
c6xuomqgrxw_12-8-rgb_front so i put that down there just because it is a way to keep it out of the way
c6xuomqgrxw_13-8-rgb_front so those are some things you want to think about when placing your cutting boards
c6xuomqgrxw_14-8-rgb_front where doing your cutting
c6xuomqgrxw_15-8-rgb_front how often using each cutting board and what makes sense for where to put them
c6xuomqgrxw_2-8-rgb_front so the cutting boards that i use most frequently i am keeping right here hanging on the wall and i just put in a small nail because these are not terribly heavy and they all ready had these holes cut in them

c7hso0azsfa_1-8-rgb_front unlike the beef i am going to bake the chicken
c7hso0azsfa_10-8-rgb_front we are just going to try to fit all our pieces in there
c7hso0azsfa_11-8-rgb_front this is a nice dish to do with chicken breast because it adds a lot of moisture to the chicken
c7hso0azsfa_12-8-rgb_front sometimes the chicken breast can be a little dry
c7hso0azsfa_13-8-rgb_front i am going to ladle a bit of the marinade over the chicken now before putting it into the oven

c7hso0azsfa_15-8-rgb_front here goes our chicken into the oven and we are going to set our timer for ten minutes
c7hso0azsfa_2-8-rgb_front you can broil it how you usually would broil rather small pieces of chicken breast but i prefer to bake it

c88yvo-7xza_2-3-rgb_front okay now let is look at our bacon
c88yvo-7xza_3-3-rgb_front we want to cut our bacon with hickory smoke bacon and i am just going to lay these three pieces together and i am going to use some scissors to cut cause it is really easy
c88yvo-7xza_4-3-rgb_front so we are just going to cut these pieces it will help bacon is going to help give those green beans like a smoky flavor
c88yvo-7xza_5-3-rgb_front and we are using about three slices of bacon here
c88yvo-7xza_6-3-rgb_front we are just cutting into pieces cause now we are going to take this bacon and we are going to put it in a heavy pot there and we are going to render this out and we are going to use the fat from the bacon to you know mix the rest of our stuff and smoky and crispiness of the bacon
c88yvo-7xza_7-3-rgb_front it is going to come through in the green beans
c88yvo-7xza_8-3-rgb_front anyway here is where we are and now let is move on to our next step
c8gfjv9axym_0-8-rgb_front okay now that we have created our little spider out of yarn or string you are going to take the base of his body and we are going to want to attach that to our spider web base that we created here
c8gfjv9axym_1-8-rgb_front so you can put it at any of the corners and what you are going to do is take some glue and just put some glue on the back of your spider in the middle of those knots it builds up a good base for us
c8gfjv9axym_2-8-rgb_front and put a good amount of glue on there because this tacky glue elmer is glue that is all going to dry clear
c8gfjv9axym_3-8-rgb_front so i am going to put him on this top corner and i am just going to hold him on there nice and firm pushing him down and you are going to allow him to dry on there for about twenty seconds
c8gfjv9axym_4-8-rgb_front if he is still coming loose you can surround the area with some more of this glue because again it will dry clear and you just do not want that spider coming off
c8gfjv9axym_5-8-rgb_front so i am going to place a small amount here on the underside where you can see it is white there now but again it will dry clear
c8gfjv9axym_6-8-rgb_front and once he dries now you have your spider on the base of your spider web for your necklace
c9twqhwlwcg_0-8-rgb_front hi
c9twqhwlwcg_1-8-rgb_front jim dowd at zoaroutdoor com
c9twqhwlwcg_10-8-rgb_front and how you do it
c9twqhwlwcg_11-8-rgb_front just a tiny little tug just before you make your pop stop
c9twqhwlwcg_12-8-rgb_front a tug tug tug tug
c9twqhwlwcg_13-8-rgb_front you notice back tug forward tug
c9twqhwlwcg_14-8-rgb_front i am doing them together
c9twqhwlwcg_15-8-rgb_front i am using my hands together
c9twqhwlwcg_16-8-rgb_front so the haul is something that if you work on at a time first the back and the forward will enable you to fish more efficiently and cast farther
c9twqhwlwcg_3-8-rgb_front in part cast we made our casting movements and our stops and strokes with just the rod hand
c9twqhwlwcg_4-8-rgb_front let me introduce something called the haul with the line hand
c9twqhwlwcg_5-8-rgb_front what the haul does is gives a tiny little tug just before you make your forward stroke
c9twqhwlwcg_6-8-rgb_front just a tiny little tug
c9twqhwlwcg_7-8-rgb_front and that forces the load of the weight of the fly line into the rod a little more and gives you more acceleration
c9twqhwlwcg_8-8-rgb_front it is a wonderful thing to use when there is wind because it drives your loop faster
c9twqhwlwcg_9-8-rgb_front faster speed translates into greater efficiency it also contributes to accuracy
c9op_vhf-5e_0-3-rgb_front hey how is it going
c9op_vhf-5e_1-3-rgb_front welcome to expert diving
c9op_vhf-5e_10-3-rgb_front arms swing up knee swings up everything is driving up so that you can jump off of one foot as high as you possibly can jump
c9op_vhf-5e_11-3-rgb_front and after you jump you want to stretch rise in to the air ok watch
c9op_vhf-5e_12-3-rgb_front ok that is the jump in diving
c9op_vhf-5e_2-3-rgb_front i am bobby larew your expert for the day
c9op_vhf-5e_3-3-rgb_front we are talking about the jump ok in the hurdle alright
c9op_vhf-5e_4-3-rgb_front we have set ourself up we have got our last step our arms have come back we are driving down in to the board ok we are going to push up now we are actually ready to jump up in to the air ok
c9op_vhf-5e_5-3-rgb_front jumping is a little tricky because as you jump the board is flexing down ok
c9op_vhf-5e_6-3-rgb_front it is not solid ground so you might feel a little weird bouncing on the end of the board
c9op_vhf-5e_7-3-rgb_front but here is what the jump is actually going to look like
c9op_vhf-5e_8-3-rgb_front you press down in to the board to get a little push and a little spring then you are going to explode
c9op_vhf-5e_9-3-rgb_front we worked on the leg strengthen exercises here is where they come in to play
cchrqosb1gc_0-5-rgb_front bait your dog just like we talked about in the previous commands is important to let your dog know that a command is right around the corner
cchrqosb1gc_1-5-rgb_front as i have said use small treats and when your dog gets to the point of understanding your commands you can always use a fake bait to get their attention
cchrqosb1gc_2-5-rgb_front but if you are just starting off with a new puppy or a new dog i would recommend using a treat for every command until they truly understand the command then start to diminish the food
cchrqosb1gc_3-5-rgb_front the command we are talking about here stay i want the dog is attention to know a command is coming
cchrqosb1gc_4-5-rgb_front when the dog knows that i have food i know that i am going to have the complete attention so they understand what command is coming next
cchrqosb1gc_5-5-rgb_front as they pick the command up more you certainly do not have to use the food but at this stage of the game for any new commands i would highly recommend baiting the dog
ce23zzfubdw_0-5-rgb_front we wanted also to go through a thorough physical exam and i am going to ask the owner of this kitty cat that if they have any health concerns
ce23zzfubdw_1-5-rgb_front so that is where we are going to start
ce23zzfubdw_12-5-rgb_front and with a little bit of luck you will learn how to brush their teeth
ce23zzfubdw_13-5-rgb_front take care of their nails and things like that
ce23zzfubdw_14-5-rgb_front but we are going to do a thorough physical exam now and look your kitty cat all over
ce23zzfubdw_15-5-rgb_front unfortunately your cat now is so small it does not even move our scales
ce23zzfubdw_16_17_18-5-rgb_front so that means she is lighter i am sorry he is lighter than three pounds so it is just kind of a small kitty probably next time in about a month when you come in we will be able to get a more accurate weight
ce23zzfubdw_19-5-rgb_front so we start looking at their eyes first and everything is clear in the eyes
ce23zzfubdw_2-5-rgb_front we want to go ahead and have a good look at your cat
ce23zzfubdw_20-5-rgb_front we would like to look in the ear and the eyes and be sure there is not any ear mites
ce23zzfubdw_21-5-rgb_front cats frequently get some ear mites
ce23zzfubdw_22-5-rgb_front and they are perfectly clear
ce23zzfubdw_23-5-rgb_front i am not seeing any problems there
ce23zzfubdw_24-5-rgb_front and again this is all part of the stuff that might be good for you to do at home is to hold onto the ear and touch the kitty cat all over
ce23zzfubdw_25-5-rgb_front and it makes it less traumatic when we have to have a look at them during the exam
ce23zzfubdw_26-5-rgb_front we like to be sure that their eyes are clear
ce23zzfubdw_27-5-rgb_front and there is just a little bit of discharge coming from this cat is eye
ce23zzfubdw_28-5-rgb_front you can see right in the corner here
ce23zzfubdw_29-5-rgb_front and so one of those things that you are going to want to watch for is to be sure you do not get a lot of discharge from this cat is eye or any sneezing
ce23zzfubdw_3-5-rgb_front i think i actually put your kitty cat to sleep by putting him in there and talking so quietly
ce23zzfubdw_30-5-rgb_front if that happens you should give me a call
ce23zzfubdw_31-5-rgb_front now these are all baby teeth
ce23zzfubdw_32-5-rgb_front you can see that we do not have any adult teeth yet because we are so young
ce23zzfubdw_33-5-rgb_front and we open it up and look all the way down in there
ce23zzfubdw_34-5-rgb_front they kind of think that is kind of a mean thing to do at first
ce23zzfubdw_35-5-rgb_front but they get used to it
ce23zzfubdw_36-5-rgb_front and everything looks normal
ce23zzfubdw_37-5-rgb_front now all of those teeth that you see there are going to fall out
ce23zzfubdw_38-5-rgb_front we get a whole new set of teeth and those are all baby teeth
ce23zzfubdw_39-5-rgb_front and by the time your cat is six months of age there will not be any baby teeth left only adult teeth
ce23zzfubdw_4-5-rgb_front but what we are going to do is bring the kitty cat out and have a little bit of an exam
ce23zzfubdw_40-5-rgb_front so we are going to listen to the heart
ce23zzfubdw_41-5-rgb_front and kitty is purring a lot
ce23zzfubdw_42-5-rgb_front so it is hard to hear the heart
ce23zzfubdw_43-5-rgb_front there we go
ce23zzfubdw_44-5-rgb_front and the lungs are fine
ce23zzfubdw_45-5-rgb_front everything is clear
ce23zzfubdw_46-5-rgb_front and you just want to play do not you
ce23zzfubdw_47-5-rgb_front you want to go ahead and look at the underside too and be sure that there is no particular problems with your cat
ce23zzfubdw_48-5-rgb_front there is no hernia and both of the testicles have come down
ce23zzfubdw_49-5-rgb_front so we are in great shape
ce23zzfubdw_5-5-rgb_front now do you have any particular concerns about your cat is health
ce23zzfubdw_6-5-rgb_front as you mentioned the upper respiratory would be my main concern
ce23zzfubdw_7-5-rgb_front have you seen any problems with that
ce23zzfubdw_8-5-rgb_front have you seen your kitty cat do any sneezing or watering from the eyes or anything
ce23zzfubdw_9_10_11-5-rgb_front no ok well we are going to go through just a few things while we look at your kitty cat it is very important i think at this age to try and do some little training with your cat and let it be used to being handled
cewxs80fc8q_1-1-rgb_front one of the things that brian can do to help his accuracy with running routes is just simply by laying down cones and then he can mark off his running
cewxs80fc8q_2-1-rgb_front this is where his mark could be and then he can mark off wherever his angle is that he wants to emulate until the point of the ball gets to him
cfc40yw8cyq_0-8-rgb_front hi i am nancy frensley i am the training manager at the berkeley east bay humane society
cfc40yw8cyq_1-8-rgb_front a lot of times people ask me about various types of enclosures in which they can put their dogs for various reasons the most common type of dog pen is an indoor pen usually and it is called an ex pen or exercise pen
cfc40yw8cyq_10-8-rgb_front these pens come in a number of different heights and sizes so you can get pens that are very very tall for larger dogs
cfc40yw8cyq_11-8-rgb_front the trick is to do it while you are at home teach your dog to settle down in the pen by using rewards little treats good girl she is being a very very good girl there
cfc40yw8cyq_12-8-rgb_front she is getting a little treat for lying down and they become quite comfortable inside the pen
cfc40yw8cyq_13-8-rgb_front one of the best uses for these pens is when you have a dog and a small child
cfc40yw8cyq_14-8-rgb_front this the pen indoors gives your dog a nice safe place to be so a toddler is not tripping falling or grabbing at fur and it helps your dog feel safe while getting used to a small child in your home
cfc40yw8cyq_2-8-rgb_front most of them are made of wire like this one and once dogs are trained to stay inside them they do not try to get out
cfc40yw8cyq_3-8-rgb_front they are happy they have freedom of movement this pen for instance can become much much larger
cfc40yw8cyq_4-8-rgb_front and those of us that go to competitions and take our dogs to compete various places have all trained our dogs to stay inside an indoor enclosure like this
cfc40yw8cyq_5-8-rgb_front sometimes they are just under a canopy
cfc40yw8cyq_6-8-rgb_front these are very very useful for instance if you take your dog to the park for a picnic
cfc40yw8cyq_7-8-rgb_front you can house your dog inside a comfortable enclosure like this temporary and use it for a temporary enclosure inside so that your dog has room to move around
cfc40yw8cyq_8-8-rgb_front when you are house training a dog especially a small dog could work well in a small pen like a short pen like this
cfc40yw8cyq_9-8-rgb_front when you are house training a puppy a pen like this is more comfortable then a crate so your puppy learns to go in the crate for short term confinement and in the pen for longer term confinement
cglhwm9btzw_0-8-rgb_front stepping in for me to talk a little about the coffeemakers is my personal coffee guru ms leslie mosel
cglhwm9btzw_1-8-rgb_front ok as you can see here we have actually two different types of coffee makers
cglhwm9btzw_12-8-rgb_front depending on how strong you like your coffee i like to cheat a little bit if i put four scoops i put four and a half cups of water that way its not to strong and it usually helps with the flavor
cglhwm9btzw_2-8-rgb_front one is specifically a espresso maker and the other one is just your standard coffee maker that most people have at home
cglhwm9btzw_3-8-rgb_front this one i actually use on a daily basis so there are quite a few settings that come along with this coffee maker
cglhwm9btzw_4-8-rgb_front of course all coffee makers do have water levels shown
cglhwm9btzw_5-8-rgb_front this one is really nice because as you pour in the water you can actually see where the level is and i will talk about that a little bit more later when i tell you actually the best way to use your coffee maker to make really good tasting coffee
cglhwm9btzw_6-8-rgb_front this coffee maker i really like it actually has the time setting as you can see here digitally on the front of the coffee maker and it is pm am is a really good thing to make sure that is correct because this actually has the option to delay brewing
cgzohl-yq4i_0-3-rgb_front the next thing we are going to do now that we have primed her skin with a foundation primer is we are going to apply some liquid foundation
cgzohl-yq4i_1-3-rgb_front this is a really nice light weight oil free liquid foundation
cgzohl-yq4i_2-3-rgb_front one thing you want to be sure of when you are choosing a foundation for yourself is you want to make sure it blends really well into the skin
cgzohl-yq4i_3-3-rgb_front if you put a stripe on the side of the face from cheek to jaw it should blend in perfectly
cgzohl-yq4i_4-3-rgb_front it should not leave any noticeable mark of demarcation along the jaw because you should never be able to see where your face ends and your neck begins
cgzohl-yq4i_5-3-rgb_front it should just blend in really perfectly
cgzohl-yq4i_6-3-rgb_front this color is a really good match for her skin
cgzohl-yq4i_7-3-rgb_front we are going to take a little bit of this
cgzohl-yq4i_8-3-rgb_front i am going to use my foundation brush and we are just going to brush this all over just to even out her complexion and give her a little bit of light coverage
cgzohl-yq4i_9-3-rgb_front the nice thing about this particular foundation is that it is a buildable coverage so you can use a layering affect with it if you need to and it will not look heavy or cakey
ch7aviir0-0_0-8-rgb_front hi
ch7aviir0-0_10-8-rgb_front by doing this action not only do we have full response to the lashes here but we can also make the client feel at ease because they are not seeing this wand going straight out their eyes
ch7aviir0-0_11-8-rgb_front i am just going to briefly hold up just along the brow there
ch7aviir0-0_12-8-rgb_front explain to your client that when we apply mascara in the salon or spa we can only do so much
ch7aviir0-0_13-8-rgb_front sometimes at home they like to do their coats or whatever
ch7aviir0-0_14-8-rgb_front we can certainly get a nice coverage
ch7aviir0-0_15-8-rgb_front she has beautiful lashes so that turned out perfect
ch7aviir0-0_16-8-rgb_front new wand
ch7aviir0-0_17-8-rgb_front we are just going to dip that right in
ch7aviir0-0_18-8-rgb_front again the client look down
ch7aviir0-0_19-8-rgb_front perfect
ch7aviir0-0_2-8-rgb_front in our next segment we will be showing you mascara application
ch7aviir0-0_20-8-rgb_front and our last step to the mascara application is going to be the curling of the lashes
ch7aviir0-0_21-8-rgb_front again you are going to have that client look down
ch7aviir0-0_22-8-rgb_front you notice by doing this after mascara application
ch7aviir0-0_23-8-rgb_front yes it is messy but because we sanitize eyelash curler everytime it is just fine
ch7aviir0-0_24-8-rgb_front what this does is it creates almost an extra hold like using hairspray on your hair and then curling it
ch7aviir0-0_25-8-rgb_front same sort of effect you are going to get with using this after applying mascara
ch7aviir0-0_26-8-rgb_front watch our next segment on appying cheek color
ch7aviir0-0_3-8-rgb_front the supplies that we are going to need for this is actually disposable mascara wands and we are also going to need our professional mascara
ch7aviir0-0_4-8-rgb_front the application of mascara can be very scary to makeup artist and scary to clients so really reasuring them that we know what we are doing we have a steady hand and we have a great technique for applying mascara will help them feel at ease
ch7aviir0-0_5-8-rgb_front what we are going to do is we are going to take that mascara and remove the wand
ch7aviir0-0_6-8-rgb_front we are then going to dip our mascara wand just once in
ch7aviir0-0_7-8-rgb_front now if we were to go up the traditional movement of going into mascara can actually cause clumping
ch7aviir0-0_8-8-rgb_front just once in and once out will get plenty of product
ch7aviir0-0_9-8-rgb_front next we are going to have our client look down
cisgeiwfi8i_0-3-rgb_front selecting a good product can be very difficult
cisgeiwfi8i_1-3-rgb_front my name is sylvia russell and i am going to show you how you can select a good product
cisgeiwfi8i_10-3-rgb_front remember there are tons of products on the market everything from foams to sprays to all kinds of things
cisgeiwfi8i_11-3-rgb_front if you are not sure what to buy for your hair ask your local professional
cisgeiwfi8i_12-3-rgb_front i am sure that she can recommend the product that is best for you
cisgeiwfi8i_13-3-rgb_front make sure and check your grocery store your beauty supply store even your local dollar store
cisgeiwfi8i_14-3-rgb_front there is everything out there with the perfect price point for you
cisgeiwfi8i_15-3-rgb_front remember selecting the right products can be good or bad for your hair
cisgeiwfi8i_16-3-rgb_front my name is sylvia russell and this is how you can select the best styling products for you
cisgeiwfi8i_2-3-rgb_front now remember all hair is not created equal
cisgeiwfi8i_3-3-rgb_front so we must choose the best products to suit our hair care needs
cisgeiwfi8i_4-3-rgb_front there are many products on the market and so make sure that you get your information so that you buy the best products for you
cisgeiwfi8i_5-3-rgb_front there are many creams on the market today that help with volume and shine and these are the things that we need to help give us a beautiful look
cisgeiwfi8i_6-3-rgb_front there are many shampoos and conditioners that are going to help moisturize and detangle the hair
cisgeiwfi8i_7-3-rgb_front if you have frizzy hair you might want to try a foam
cisgeiwfi8i_8-3-rgb_front now a foam is something that can help alleviate frizz and it is something that also is easy to use and it comes out in a foam and it is very good for your hair
cisgeiwfi8i_9-3-rgb_front it gives shine and it give bounce so if you have curly hair you are trying to control your frizz maybe you want to try some foam
citquvkneoc_1-8-rgb_front and we are going to talk about what happens when your car battery dies how to select a new battery and how to see what the problem is
citquvkneoc_10-8-rgb_front as you can see this wrench is long enough to contact between the two battery terminals which could result in a very powerful spark and liquid lead or metal shooting off in those sparks
citquvkneoc_11-8-rgb_front a good way to avoid causing sparks at the battery with your wrench is to begin by disconnecting the negative terminal first
citquvkneoc_12-8-rgb_front that way when your touching the terminal with your wrench if the wrench touches any other part of the car there is not going to be a difference in currant resulting in a spark
citquvkneoc_13-8-rgb_front if you start with the positive terminal while the battery is connected and you touch the body of the car you are going to arc twelve volts from the battery to the car because there is a difference in voltage
citquvkneoc_14-8-rgb_front and you are electrical system controls all that power
citquvkneoc_15-8-rgb_front so you want to be careful and if you are not experienced maybe you should cover your wrench with electrical tape except for the very tip
citquvkneoc_2-8-rgb_front so the first step is we are going to see if the terminals are tight
citquvkneoc_3-8-rgb_front now if you wiggle the terminals and they twist sometimes that means there is enough of a gap between the terminal and the clamp that there is corrosion in there that you can not see
citquvkneoc_4-8-rgb_front so let is pull these terminals off and look inside there and see what it really looks like
citquvkneoc_5-8-rgb_front so we are going to remove these terminals with a wrench
citquvkneoc_6-8-rgb_front this car is foreign japanese made so i am using a metric wrench
citquvkneoc_7-8-rgb_front it happens to be a mm wrench
citquvkneoc_8-8-rgb_front now the wrench is metal and it is a very good conductor
citquvkneoc_9-8-rgb_front the battery creates a lot of electricity between these two poles
ciyvz8ztify_0-1-rgb_front the outer coat is the part that the undercoat typically is falling out into and it gets mixed up in the matt of the undercoat
ciyvz8ztify_1-1-rgb_front so the outer coat as you can see here we have got a tiny briard
ciyvz8ztify_10-1-rgb_front if she did not have undercoat then you would see just her outer coat and it would be lying a lot flatter to her body
ciyvz8ztify_11-1-rgb_front the undercoat serves a purpose of insulation and the outer coat serves a purpose of protection from the elements
ciyvz8ztify_12-1-rgb_front so we have gone over now the difference between the outer coat and the undercoat and again the outer coat is where we are getting our length
ciyvz8ztify_13-1-rgb_front if we break the outer coat while we are brushing we are going to be breaking the length off and we will have a shorted coated breed shorted coated dog
ciyvz8ztify_14-1-rgb_front so we want to be careful when we are brushing the outer coat that we do not actually break it
ciyvz8ztify_15-1-rgb_front we work with it with the appropriate tools in an appropriate way that we are guarding the length here
ciyvz8ztify_2-1-rgb_front we have got the outer coat here this is the part that gives us the length
ciyvz8ztify_3-1-rgb_front so her outer coat is about inches long
ciyvz8ztify_4-1-rgb_front she does have some undercoat you can see that she has some undercoat but not a ton
ciyvz8ztify_5-1-rgb_front she is a little bit more mature she is years old
ciyvz8ztify_6-1-rgb_front the outer coat again you can see it coming down the tail
ciyvz8ztify_7-1-rgb_front so this is the outer coat and the outer coat is best brushed with something like a pin brush
ciyvz8ztify_8-1-rgb_front we have got some texture here for the outer coat
ciyvz8ztify_9-1-rgb_front so this is the outer coat again this is where we are working right now with a double coated breed and there could be a different amount of under and outer coat
cj8ryw9pzku_0-8-rgb_front gina kennedy hanumanasana is a pose that even some practice yogis are a little bit nervous about trying
cj8ryw9pzku_1-8-rgb_front but when you use blocks to come into it it can make it so much easier
cj8ryw9pzku_10-8-rgb_front now you could bring this block at whatever level
cj8ryw9pzku_11-8-rgb_front we could head it up the other way as well whatever works for you
cj8ryw9pzku_12_13_14-8-rgb_front so you have to experiment just a little good her toes should be down and back extending out through her back leg
cj8ryw9pzku_15-8-rgb_front good
cj8ryw9pzku_16-8-rgb_front now notice how she has to lean forward a little bit
cj8ryw9pzku_17-8-rgb_front so if we bring blocks and place them to the sides by her hips she can take her hands to the block and fully lengthen up through her spine
cj8ryw9pzku_18-8-rgb_front good
cj8ryw9pzku_19-8-rgb_front then she can feel her energy moving from her hips all the way up to the crown of the head and then extending out through the ball of her foot and her back big toe
cj8ryw9pzku_2-8-rgb_front so we are going to have faith demonstrate the split for us
cj8ryw9pzku_20-8-rgb_front good
cj8ryw9pzku_21-8-rgb_front just lengthening up
cj8ryw9pzku_22-8-rgb_front good
cj8ryw9pzku_23-8-rgb_front and then as you practice you can keep lowering your block maybe using smaller blocks and then maybe even a blanket and lower and lower until gradually before you know it you are in the full split
cj8ryw9pzku_3-8-rgb_front she is going to come into table top first
cj8ryw9pzku_4-8-rgb_front good
cj8ryw9pzku_5-8-rgb_front and i am just going to have her bring her back knee forward and place her foot on the ground in between her hands
cj8ryw9pzku_6-8-rgb_front good
cj8ryw9pzku_7-8-rgb_front and we are going to use this block to place right under faith is hamstring
cj8ryw9pzku_8-8-rgb_front and she is very gently and very slowly going to ease her foot forward
cj8ryw9pzku_9-8-rgb_front good
cjo5s96w7cs_0-8-rgb_front ian loveall hi
cjo5s96w7cs_10-8-rgb_front our light source is that window over there and so as the light comes streaming in it is going to be blocked by any object in its path
cjo5s96w7cs_11-8-rgb_front for example this border here is going to block the light and the wall directly behind is not going to receive any light creating a cast shadow
cjo5s96w7cs_12-8-rgb_front again down here along the bottom edge cast shadow
cjo5s96w7cs_13-8-rgb_front even the vines that are growing up along the wall will create cast shadows against the wall where the vine is blocking the light falling on the wall surface
cjo5s96w7cs_2-8-rgb_front we are talking about mural painting today light and shadow
cjo5s96w7cs_3-8-rgb_front light and shadow are the keys to realistic painting
cjo5s96w7cs_4-8-rgb_front if you look at this example here we have got a lot of cast shadow going on
cjo5s96w7cs_5-8-rgb_front normally mural painters will sort of shy away from cast shadow because it is dark and we usually want to avoid dark in a painting on a wall because it closes in the space
cjo5s96w7cs_6-8-rgb_front i am telling you do not be afraid of shadows
cjo5s96w7cs_7-8-rgb_front this is what is going to make your painting pop
cjo5s96w7cs_8-8-rgb_front so for example we have a lot of cast shadows here
cjo5s96w7cs_9-8-rgb_front we have a shadow being cast from the bouquet the urn we have a cast shadow here from the dove and a lot of shadow going on under the architectural work here
cko9_7msf9c_0-5-rgb_front hi i am kerri from zebra and berkley and i am here to tell you how to use ear tapers
cko9_7msf9c_1-5-rgb_front an ear taper is the tool used when you are stretching your ears when you are going from one gauge to the next gauge up
cko9_7msf9c_10-5-rgb_front if you are doing it on your own i have seen some people wrap a thin piece of tape around it in order to make sure that you do not lose that connection
cko9_7msf9c_11-5-rgb_front i am kerri your favorite piercer and i have done over piercings
cko9_7msf9c_2-5-rgb_front if you look at a taper you will see that there is a small size and a larger size
cko9_7msf9c_3-5-rgb_front a small size ideally is the size that you are currently at
cko9_7msf9c_4-5-rgb_front the larger size is the size that you want to be at
cko9_7msf9c_5-5-rgb_front it kind of resembles a funnel in a way and it funnels your ear to the point where you want it to be at
cko9_7msf9c_6-5-rgb_front when you are using a taper you want to clean the area using some kind of disinfectant or antibacterial soap and water and then you are going to want to lubricate the taper pen with a and d ointment or neosporin or some kind of vaseline in order to help it run through your ear smoothly
cko9_7msf9c_7-5-rgb_front when pushing the taper pin through you do want to support it with your hands from the back so you are pushing against something and creating a counter pressure
cko9_7msf9c_8-5-rgb_front that way you are not just pushing your ear into the side of your face with a taper pin
cko9_7msf9c_9-5-rgb_front when you line up the piece of jewelry against the larger size of the taper pin the size of the jewelry that you want to put in you want to make sure that you line it up exactly lined up correctly with no gaps or spaces in order to get it in smoothly
ckearm4izws_0-8-rgb_front there are a number of nuances in wood cut print making and it has to deal to a large degree with your materials and techniques and how you go about printing your block of wood
ckearm4izws_1-8-rgb_front here is two prints each is on a different type of paper
ckearm4izws_10-8-rgb_front there is also color that is been added in to certain areas and printed over top of it
ckearm4izws_11-8-rgb_front it gives you a lot more flexibility when as we did today we can pull back the piece of paper and print it again and again and really work into the print in a very patronly way
ckearm4izws_12-8-rgb_front it gives you two very different looks to the print
ckearm4izws_13-8-rgb_front this is facilitated not only by the paper but also the method of print making
ckearm4izws_2-8-rgb_front this is a kitty coda which is a japanese paper
ckearm4izws_3-8-rgb_front and this is a western reeves light weight paper
ckearm4izws_4-8-rgb_front they are also printed differently
ckearm4izws_5-8-rgb_front this print was printed on a press
ckearm4izws_6-8-rgb_front you can tell by the absolutely clean and even surface that the print has made onto the piece of paper
ckearm4izws_7-8-rgb_front this large stretch of very even color is much easier to create using a press
ckearm4izws_8-8-rgb_front however in this print that was hand printed you can see where certain elements of a painter leaves can come out from the print
ckearm4izws_9-8-rgb_front it is hand printed so there can be different pressures
cmjddvy5wlo_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to learn how to install a ceiling fan in your home
cmjddvy5wlo_10-5-rgb_front what we simply do is take the wire nut off of the existing wire
cmjddvy5wlo_11-5-rgb_front i am going to trim this just a little bit
cmjddvy5wlo_12-5-rgb_front something like that and then we simply lay this wire next to this one
cmjddvy5wlo_13-5-rgb_front they are laying next to each other just like that you take your wire nut and put it on like that
cmjddvy5wlo_14-5-rgb_front then the threads inside the wire nut would twist the wire together and you tighten this up pretty good
cmjddvy5wlo_15-5-rgb_front okay that has about pounds of torch on it so that is pretty tight
cmjddvy5wlo_16-5-rgb_front so there we now have our neutral wire connect to our fan neutral wire with a wire nut
cmjddvy5wlo_2-5-rgb_front the next step is to wire the ceiling fan
cmjddvy5wlo_3-5-rgb_front we do now have the fan hung here is the bracket securely screwed into wood above the sheet rock
cmjddvy5wlo_4-5-rgb_front the fan ball is hanging in the bracket and it looks good
cmjddvy5wlo_5-5-rgb_front so the next step is to hook the wiring the white wire would go with the white wire coming out of the ceiling
cmjddvy5wlo_6-5-rgb_front so we are going to go ahead and give ourselves a little bit of extra and then we are going to cut our fan wire
cmjddvy5wlo_7-5-rgb_front then these are diagonals or wire cutters
cmjddvy5wlo_8-5-rgb_front then we can very carefully go around in a circle with this and then you can pull off the wire insulation like that
cmjddvy5wlo_9-5-rgb_front so this white wire and this white wire are the neutral wires that we would connect this white wire to this one
cokcdituta8_0-8-rgb_front have you ever wondered on what specific foods you can eat to whiten your teeth
cokcdituta8_1-8-rgb_front well my name is michelle and i am a dental assistant with solutionz and i am here to kind of give you a few choices to help whiten your teeth
cokcdituta8_10-8-rgb_front and also too with lemons but you do not want to do that too much you also just want to do that in moderation
cokcdituta8_11-8-rgb_front but once again my name is michelle and i am a dental assistant with solutionz and hopefully i just explained to you the certain foods to eat to keep your teeth white
cokcdituta8_2-8-rgb_front first of all milk is always a great product to drink
cokcdituta8_3-8-rgb_front it helps strengthen your teeth and in return it helps kind of to keep your teeth nice and white
cokcdituta8_4-8-rgb_front chewing on apples biting into apples it kind of the acid from it will break up any stainings that you might have and then also too the rind of the apple will kind of clean your teeth also in the same sense when you are chewing on the apple it kind of frees of the bacteria and the debris that might be resting on your teeth
cokcdituta8_5-8-rgb_front also too lemons if you cut up a lemon and kind of just rub your teeth with the lemon
cokcdituta8_6-8-rgb_front you do not want to do that too often because the acid from the lemon will actually eat away at your enamel and kind of maybe possibly expose your dentin and in return you will start to become sensitive to hot and cold temperatures
cokcdituta8_7-8-rgb_front so lemons every once in a blue moon basically if you just cut up a lemon wedge kind of chew on it for a little bit rub your teeth on it
cokcdituta8_8-8-rgb_front and then also too with taking whitening tooth paste
cokcdituta8_9-8-rgb_front but the main reasons the types of foods that will help whiten your teeth are milk drinking lots of milk will actually whiten your teeth and keep them with the calcium and the strength of them
cpf2w6vr7tc_6-8-rgb_front go ahead and use the finer part of your comb and you are going to come in and you are going to keep your comb moving consistently and blend this line away
cpf2w6vr7tc_7-8-rgb_front keep in mind you definitely want to keep your scissors and your comb moving at all times so that way you do not stop and put a hole in there head
cpf2w6vr7tc_8-8-rgb_front stay tuned for our next segment which i am going to go ahead and give you a tip to make the scissor over comb blending a little bit easier for you
cpzreuazgsa_0-8-rgb_front hi i am chris faircloth artistic director and of salon teez
cpzreuazgsa_12-8-rgb_front once i have the length of where i want that hair to be i will simply cut the ends of the hair off and this may take more than one cut
cpzreuazgsa_13-8-rgb_front now i have created my fringe
cpzreuazgsa_14-8-rgb_front i simply comb the hair back over and i have created a nice short to longer piece
cpzreuazgsa_15-8-rgb_front you can create this or do this as short as you want to
cpzreuazgsa_16-8-rgb_front it is best to do it in increments versus just one big large chunk otherwise it may be shorter than what you actually wanted it to be
cpzreuazgsa_17-8-rgb_front so again i comb the hair over have it nice and tight i am down to a horizontal slightly twist the hair over grab it with my fingers notice that where my shortest piece will be is about at the bridge of the nose cut the hair off bluntly release the hair and comb it back over the side that we want it to go on
cpzreuazgsa_18-8-rgb_front and now i have got my short to long piece that melds into the sides and the back nicely without creating a lot of havoc
cpzreuazgsa_2-8-rgb_front one of the fringes that is wildly popular right now is the side swept fringe where it goes from short to long across the face
cpzreuazgsa_3-8-rgb_front we could create this just by placing our comb in a position such as this and cutting the hair off but an easy way to do this would be to place our comb on the hair line and rock the comb back
cpzreuazgsa_6-8-rgb_front now we will look to see where the part or the section is going to be and rather than create another pyramid line down to the corner of the eyebrow we will actually incorporate that part into our section here so our section will be more of a slight rectangle than a true pyramid
cq4iy7edxmq_0-3-rgb_front o k
cq4iy7edxmq_1-3-rgb_front so we have thrown our chuck to trim our bottle necked vase here and we are ready to put this vase onto our chuck
cq4iy7edxmq_2-3-rgb_front we drew the wire underneath it before hand and often times when it is ready to go it will simply pop off the wheel however this one does not want to come off with larger parts it is often the case
cq4iy7edxmq_3-3-rgb_front so what i am going to do is take my wire tool and once again just draw it underneath keeping it nice and tight so it does not go into the pot
cq4iy7edxmq_4-3-rgb_front now we have released it simply lift it off
cq4iy7edxmq_5-3-rgb_front now we are going to take the chuck and put it on the wheel like so and then we are going to take our vase turn it upside down i like to hold it in two hands like this and place it into the chuck
cq4iy7edxmq_6-3-rgb_front o k
cq4iy7edxmq_7-3-rgb_front so now we have our vase in place to be trimmed the next thing we are going to want to do is center this now it is already fairly well centered because the chuck is centered but there are some centering but there are some centering issues that we are going to want to take care of and we are going to be doing that in the next segment
cq938xe05sg_0-8-rgb_front how to change your motorcycle is oil filter
cq938xe05sg_1-8-rgb_front the first thing that you are going to want to do is locate the oil filter on your motorcycle
cq938xe05sg_10-8-rgb_front when i install the new filter i am going to make sure that i have the correct oil filter an oem one
cq938xe05sg_11-8-rgb_front i am going to make sure to have clean oil on the gasket surface or this
cq938xe05sg_12-8-rgb_front going to install it with this oil filter wrench that i have here and a common mistake that the home mechanic often does is over torques his oil filter
cq938xe05sg_13-8-rgb_front refer to your owner is manual for the torque spec with this oil filter wrench it will allow to get a torque wrench on there
cq938xe05sg_14-8-rgb_front so you never want to over torque your oil filter
cq938xe05sg_15-8-rgb_front after you have installed your oil filter on your motorcycle you are going to reinstall your drain bolt with a new gasket
cq938xe05sg_16-8-rgb_front torque that to the proper spec check your owner is manual to add the correct amount of oil and the correct oil and then you are going to follow procedures to check it and that will conclude how to change your oil filter
cq938xe05sg_2-8-rgb_front on this particular bike we have a spin on filter which is similar to most modern car oil filters
cq938xe05sg_3-8-rgb_front and in order to change this oil filter the first thing you are going to want to do is drain your oil from your motorcycle
cq938xe05sg_4-8-rgb_front so you are going to need to locate where your drain bolt is and remove all the oil from the motorcycle
cq938xe05sg_5-8-rgb_front on this particular bike the drain plug is right here
cq938xe05sg_6-8-rgb_front having a convenient oil filter wrench like this certainly makes the job a lot easier to remove your oil filter and it also will not damage the oil filter
cq938xe05sg_7-8-rgb_front i have an oil filter wrench here that i just installed on my oil filter going to spin it free
cq938xe05sg_8-8-rgb_front make sure you have a catch pan because you will lose some oil
cq938xe05sg_9-8-rgb_front once i have my oil filter removed i am going to make sure that i have this present on the old oil filter and make that it is not stuck to the mating surface therefore when you install your new one you will not have what you call a double gasket and have an oil leak
cqyiowzyywu_0-5-rgb_front now i am ready to put the images onto our sheet of plastic
cqyiowzyywu_1-5-rgb_front the piece of plastic that we are using is a thick piece of plastic but it is a bit translucent so you can see through and it will be perfect for getting the images placing the sheet of paper underneath and getting the images to show through so that we can go ahead and trace it onto the sheet of plastic
cqyiowzyywu_10-5-rgb_front do not overcrowd the plastic with images but then again do not leave any large open blank spaces
cqyiowzyywu_11-5-rgb_front you might want to hold up the plastic sheet every once in a while just to get a clear look at where you have placed your images and which spaces are still left empty
cqyiowzyywu_12-5-rgb_front and also you might want to fold it up just also to see where the fasteners are going to go so you know where to put an image you do not want to cut off an image underneath the fold
cqyiowzyywu_13-5-rgb_front so just to get a clear look it is good to stop every once in a while and just take a look at the sheet of plastic and see where your images are lying
cqyiowzyywu_14-5-rgb_front so now i have shown you how to take the images and put them onto the sheet of plastic using the original white paper the original white images that we drew
cqyiowzyywu_2-5-rgb_front so i will go ahead and do that
cqyiowzyywu_3-5-rgb_front first i want to get the right size of my plastic and i am going to cut it to about twenty four to thirty inches long
cqyiowzyywu_4-5-rgb_front so i cut off the excess and then put the plastic over the sheet of paper with my images that i drew and i am going to only use the pencil at this point i am not going to start using any kind of permanent markers yet
cqyiowzyywu_5-5-rgb_front but i am going to draw directly onto the plastic where i saw the images where the images just come through on the bottom and i move the plastic around from place to place so i can get images on different angles and on different locations of the plastic
cqyiowzyywu_6-5-rgb_front it does not have to look exactly the way it looked on the paper those are just my original images that i want to apply to the plastic but not in the same exact place
cqyiowzyywu_7-5-rgb_front it is much easier to draw the images on the plastic by using this white paper underneath because when you draw on the plastic this plastic sheet that we are using you do not see the images you can not really see the pencil so clearly
cqyiowzyywu_8-5-rgb_front so it is a lot easier to have the image underneath and then just trace around it so you do not have to worry about which lines you made and what lines you did not make because sometimes you made a line and you do not see it so clearly
cqyiowzyywu_9-5-rgb_front and we just move the plastic around making sure that most of the areas are covered with some type of image
cqsuwas9zjk_1-8-rgb_front we are going to talk about the next twist the full twist
cqsuwas9zjk_10-8-rgb_front the next one goes around twist it in again twist it in twist it in twist it in
cqsuwas9zjk_11-8-rgb_front the final petal use the uninflated end of the balloon and sort of tie it around
cqsuwas9zjk_12-8-rgb_front this bubble you have created end twist it in there for a fairly quick and easy flower that is likely to please anyone is girlfriend
cqsuwas9zjk_2-8-rgb_front this twist is a little bit more common than most of the balloon animals you will see in fact most of them use them for legs and that sort of thing
cqsuwas9zjk_3-8-rgb_front i do not use it quite as often but any time you need a graceful leaf or petal on a flower what you do is you fold it over how big you want it and once you make a twist you go ahead and make another twist and twist it inside of it
cqsuwas9zjk_4-8-rgb_front once again big as you need it to be and fold it over and i turn it as i twist it into itself
cqsuwas9zjk_5-8-rgb_front it just seems to help it get in there a little bit easier
cqsuwas9zjk_6-8-rgb_front now this would be the stem for a flower
cqsuwas9zjk_7-8-rgb_front what you do for a flower itself is actually use a different color
cqsuwas9zjk_8-8-rgb_front you make about four to six full twists
cqsuwas9zjk_9-8-rgb_front in this case i am just going to tie the knot around itself
cr-yuyn2oxa_0-5-rgb_front hi
cr-yuyn2oxa_1-5-rgb_front i am walt cannon
cr-yuyn2oxa_10-5-rgb_front they will put you in touch with the correct avenues to go become an electrician
cr-yuyn2oxa_11-5-rgb_front the other thing would be to study your math and be very well enunciated in math
cr-yuyn2oxa_12-5-rgb_front and all scores on any test are required to be average or better
cr-yuyn2oxa_13-5-rgb_front i would make sure that i am a good reader good listener
cr-yuyn2oxa_14-5-rgb_front specially a good listener
cr-yuyn2oxa_15-5-rgb_front because the people you are working with the hazards that you are working with
cr-yuyn2oxa_16-5-rgb_front if you are not very careful it would kill you
cr-yuyn2oxa_2-5-rgb_front i have been an electrician thirty two years
cr-yuyn2oxa_3-5-rgb_front owner operator of cannon electric
cr-yuyn2oxa_4-5-rgb_front i have been asked to give a few tips on being an electrician
cr-yuyn2oxa_5-5-rgb_front the first thing that i would say would be that you would go to your local jurisdiction
cr-yuyn2oxa_6-5-rgb_front and find out the requirements through the bureau and labor industries
cr-yuyn2oxa_7-5-rgb_front for being an electrician
cr-yuyn2oxa_8-5-rgb_front they are generally pretty informal
cr-yuyn2oxa_9-5-rgb_front as far as let you know the route to go
crepjnfswrw_0-5-rgb_front this has a little bit more athletic approach to it because it involves a squat
crepjnfswrw_1-5-rgb_front in a squat make sure you get your weight back into your heels and not into the knees just for safety
crepjnfswrw_10-5-rgb_front it comes off of the basic so if you are getting a little winded in class or the intensity level is too high go back to your basic or add the fun put up and squat pendulum so we call squat and the pendulum kick and exit the bench for the l squat step
crepjnfswrw_2-5-rgb_front it is going to be better on the knee if your hips go back
crepjnfswrw_3-5-rgb_front so we begin our off to the left side of the bench leading with the right foot
crepjnfswrw_4-5-rgb_front i start my l step and put a squat i am going to do a little pendulum kick and then exit the bench
crepjnfswrw_5-5-rgb_front so lift squat pendulum kick and down
crepjnfswrw_6-5-rgb_front eight counts to each side
crepjnfswrw_7-5-rgb_front really add some power to this because it really makes it fun
crepjnfswrw_8-5-rgb_front step lift squat little pendulum and down
crepjnfswrw_9-5-rgb_front step jump squat pendulum and down
cry7rcmlqtm_0-5-rgb_front hi i am jeanette welker
cry7rcmlqtm_1-5-rgb_front i am a certified family nurse practitioner in eugene oregon practicing at oregon optimal health
cry7rcmlqtm_2-5-rgb_front a nurse practitioner is salary can range anywheres from sixty thousand up to two hundred thousand plus depending upon the type of practice and location
cry7rcmlqtm_3-5-rgb_front a nurse practitioner with a higher degree of specialty on either the east or west coast would probably make more than one in the south or the midwest
cry7rcmlqtm_4-5-rgb_front a nurse practitioner starting out could start anywheres from a base salary of sixty to a hundred thousand
cry7rcmlqtm_5-5-rgb_front some nurse practitioners have a base salary and then added it to that a production based in addition
cry7rcmlqtm_6-5-rgb_front otherwise nurse practitioners can have a totally separate independent practice and run their own business so the range is very wide and varied as to how a nurse practitioner will practice and be paid for their practice
cterdlghzfw_0-8-rgb_front have you ever been somewhere and noticed i have a missing nail
cterdlghzfw_1-8-rgb_front my nail has popped
cterdlghzfw_10-8-rgb_front if you have a natural nail pop you may want to seek a physician
cterdlghzfw_2-8-rgb_front hi i am beauty expert jackie o and today we will discuss how to fix nail pops
cterdlghzfw_3-8-rgb_front when you notice that your nails have a missing nail the first thing that you may want to consider is how can i repair this
cterdlghzfw_4-8-rgb_front you can use the acrylic forms here take the centerpiece off and you will see that you can use this and apply this to the natural nail
cterdlghzfw_5-8-rgb_front if it has cracked in any areas and the free edge of the nail is missing you definitely want to apply it as if you are doing a regular repair
cterdlghzfw_6-8-rgb_front put the form on the nail take your acrylic brush dip it in your liquid and your powder
cterdlghzfw_7-8-rgb_front apply your primer and your prep and you want to make sure that you fill in any areas that need to be repaired
cterdlghzfw_8-8-rgb_front if you have a nail tip on you may want to consider reapplying a nail tip
cterdlghzfw_9-8-rgb_front put your glue apply it to the nail cut it to your desired length and you have your repair
cti9z6x-x90_10-3-rgb_front if you are staying in one spot and never moving from the right or to the left people are going to pass you by that you do not need to pass you by and they are going to score points off of you
cti9z6x-x90_2-3-rgb_front when you are playing a game it is very important that you know how to move within the team and move within the field
cti9z6x-x90_3-3-rgb_front you can go from the outside to the inside quickly and if you can really get some speed going you can put that shoulder down come up for a nice good block and hit the girl right off the track
cti9z6x-x90_4-3-rgb_front so what we are going to do right now is we are going to talk about cutting
cti9z6x-x90_5-3-rgb_front we are going to go in and out of the track very quickly on the whistle blow without knocking down our own team mates but learning how to cut that track back and forth closely
cti9z6x-x90_6-3-rgb_front earlier when we learned those slaloms on our sticky skates this is a good preparation for cutting back and forth across the track
cti9z6x-x90_7-3-rgb_front if you see the jammer coming along side of you you can cut the track and you can knock her into an audience member
cti9z6x-x90_8-3-rgb_front maybe even knock out their beer
cti9z6x-x90_9-3-rgb_front so cutting the track back and forth gives you a lot of mobility in the field
cuwtheno-oq_0-5-rgb_front and with this variation we have a girly version of a sports bra which is not technically i would not call this a sports bra because i do not think that you would really want to go running with lace and it is more of a for looks camisole type thing
cuwtheno-oq_1-5-rgb_front the best way to draw this is like you would draw a camisole
cuwtheno-oq_2-5-rgb_front the camisole straps are going to be thin so make sure you put your straps in the correct places
cuwtheno-oq_3-5-rgb_front then decide where you want the neckline to fall
cuwtheno-oq_4-5-rgb_front and since it is camisole inspired it is going to be a little bit higher we are not going to go down in between the boobs on this one like a regular bra it is more of a shirt an undershirt
cuwtheno-oq_5-5-rgb_front a little girl undershirt is what is inspire this is inspired by
cuwtheno-oq_6-5-rgb_front and draw your pit parts and make it go down to however whatever level you want on the ribcage
cuwtheno-oq_7-5-rgb_front and then i added in lace and a bow
cuwtheno-oq_8-5-rgb_front and you are done
cvmyqr31dr4_0-3-rgb_front in this clip of warrior training we are going to start to start to incorporate elbow strikes
cvmyqr31dr4_1-3-rgb_front elbow strikes are use a lot of times in kickboxing and thai boxing to create cuts in the opponent is face so that the fight will be stop prematurely
cvmyqr31dr4_2-3-rgb_front this particular elbow that we do in from our fighting position instead of the traditional fighting position because i am going to utilize the elbow strikes i am now going to open my hand to make my weapon longer
cvmyqr31dr4_3-3-rgb_front this is a downward elbow targeting the middle of the nose and the upper ridge
cvmyqr31dr4_4-3-rgb_front so my opponent is here his centerline is open from my fighting position hands open i step and i am striking with the pointy part of my elbow and all my weight is dropping down
cvmyqr31dr4_5-3-rgb_front all the weight comes down slow to my opponent is face
cvmyqr31dr4_6-3-rgb_front punch elbow elbow
cvmyqr31dr4_7-3-rgb_front again one of the key components to remember positioning
cvmyqr31dr4_8-3-rgb_front everything starts from your fighting position
cvmyqr31dr4_9-3-rgb_front you have to have a good base a good stance
cvpmdnjpode_0-5-rgb_front i am ivan madar
cvpmdnjpode_10-5-rgb_front we are going to pick a slope that is feasible for it where you can not run away
cvpmdnjpode_11-5-rgb_front we put both skis on and you are going to go straight down a hill
cvpmdnjpode_2-5-rgb_front next thing we will do we will give you one ski
cvpmdnjpode_3-5-rgb_front and with one ski on we are going to do drills such as scooting and skating with one ski
cvpmdnjpode_4-5-rgb_front so you will push off with one leg and ski on that okay
cvpmdnjpode_5-5-rgb_front we will take the ski off and go with the other ski
cvpmdnjpode_6-5-rgb_front we do it with both legs and eventually we will put both skis on to teach you some of the basic elements
cvpmdnjpode_7-5-rgb_front now because we are starting slower because you have not done a lot of athletic things we are going to teach you first how to stop how to keep your balance on skis and eventually how to turn
cvpmdnjpode_8-5-rgb_front now there is a different progression for someone who is not in very good condition as there is for someone who is in better athletic shape
cvpmdnjpode_9-5-rgb_front so first we are going to learn how to do what we call a straight run on your skis
cwisqehuvz4_0-3-rgb_front so opposite of hands to stand on let is see what hands are to improve on
cwisqehuvz4_1-3-rgb_front you know what i was trying to say right
cwisqehuvz4_10-3-rgb_front there is a pair of aces
cwisqehuvz4_11-3-rgb_front you know half the time i am going to try to improve on that i am going to give it one more roll see what happens
cwisqehuvz4_12-3-rgb_front well no deal i am going to give it another roll
cwisqehuvz4_13-3-rgb_front i have got two pair so now my opponent has to make two pair in three rolls
cwisqehuvz4_14-3-rgb_front specifically he has to make two pair where one of the pair are aces and then the other pair is higher than tens
cwisqehuvz4_15-3-rgb_front so but these that is improving on a roll that is a demonstration of that
cwisqehuvz4_2-3-rgb_front well there is one because we only have one pair
cwisqehuvz4_3-3-rgb_front so you are going to try to improve instead of staying and we will make it three of a kind
cwisqehuvz4_4-3-rgb_front again well you can certainly stand of three kings of course
cwisqehuvz4_5-3-rgb_front there is two pair you can stand on that
cwisqehuvz4_6-3-rgb_front look at that
cwisqehuvz4_7-3-rgb_front i rolled queens three queens
cwisqehuvz4_8-3-rgb_front so i am getting lucky here
cwisqehuvz4_9-3-rgb_front okay
cxf8i9xn144_0-3-rgb_front here we have what are called princess seams
cxf8i9xn144_1-3-rgb_front princess seams though they are called seams they are a seam but they function as a dart
cxf8i9xn144_10-3-rgb_front and if they curve more than draw this way does not totally fine
cxf8i9xn144_11-3-rgb_front but this is another version that i just thought of
cxf8i9xn144_12-3-rgb_front the typical princess seam is going to curve down and out like that and then straighten out once it gets down to the waist point
cxf8i9xn144_2-3-rgb_front that is why they are in the dart category because even though they are not called a dart that is that is their purpose
cxf8i9xn144_3-3-rgb_front the purpose of a dart as well as a princess seam is to make a garment fitted to the body based on that person is measurements
cxf8i9xn144_4-3-rgb_front so if you are going for industry standard sample size in all of your garments like your first mock up of a garment is going to be set to that sample size variation that that person is measurement a fit model
cxf8i9xn144_5-3-rgb_front and based on that princess seams are what you would see like on a jacket that is nipped in at the waist
cxf8i9xn144_6-3-rgb_front and it can princess seams allow you depending on where you place them to pull it in even further or let it out a little further and just have a slight princess seam meaning there is just a slight wider at the shoulders and down to the waist
cxf8i9xn144_7-3-rgb_front for princess seams as you would see on a jacket we will of course neckline shell top arms and then these i have shown going straight down in a v all the way to the waist
cxf8i9xn144_8-3-rgb_front they can do that
cxf8i9xn144_9-3-rgb_front or they can curve
c_1mkho7pqi_0-1-rgb_front hi i am chris faircloth artistic director and of salon teez
c_1mkho7pqi_10-1-rgb_front if they are wanting to have their hair roll under as opposed to the flip out we will make sure that the teeth are on the bottom and the top blade or the straight blade is on the top
c_1mkho7pqi_11-1-rgb_front an easy way to remember that is the teeth on the top taper teeth on bottom blend
c_1mkho7pqi_12-1-rgb_front so creating the roll under effect our teeth will be on the bottom our straight blade is on the top and now we will just take our shears and cut down
c_1mkho7pqi_13-1-rgb_front this will effectively give us a nice roll to the ends of the hair but this way the shorter hair is underneath the longer hair is on top and the longer hair will tend to want to roll under as opposed to flip out
c_1mkho7pqi_2-1-rgb_front for those clients that like to have their hair flip out on the ends the texturing shear is a great shear to use for this
c_1mkho7pqi_3-1-rgb_front we will have our teeth on the top as this will create shorter hair on the top of the hair leaving longer hair underneath to want to flip out
c_1mkho7pqi_4-1-rgb_front the shorter hair will actually help push into or collapse into the hair form or into the neck creating the longer hair to flip out
c_1mkho7pqi_5-1-rgb_front using horizontal sections and determining where we want the flip to be we will simply place our shears in the bottom blade is actually resting on my fingers
c_1mkho7pqi_6-1-rgb_front and now i am just using my shear completely closing it and sliding out
c_1mkho7pqi_7-1-rgb_front i will do this once or twice more just in the ends of the hair so that i create a nice flip to the ends of the hair
c_1mkho7pqi_8-1-rgb_front i will continue working that around the perimeter of the hair so that i get a nice even flip all the way around
c_1mkho7pqi_9-1-rgb_front as you can see the hair is beginning to want to flip on its own and that is exactly what we want to create there
c_dbdcyzc5s_1-5-rgb_front i am going to show you how to make a seafarer is double
c_dbdcyzc5s_10-5-rgb_front atlantic salmon actually do not die after they breed and this is an example like i said of atlantic salmon but unfortunately atlantic salmon are very scarce
c_dbdcyzc5s_11-5-rgb_front you are not going to find wild atlantic salmon anywhere so the most of the atlantic salmon you get will be farmed
c_dbdcyzc5s_12-5-rgb_front it is farmed in norway united states chile lots of different places but if you can like i said try to get the wild salmon
c_dbdcyzc5s_13-5-rgb_front in our next clip we are going to prep our salmon for grilling
c_dbdcyzc5s_2-5-rgb_front i just wanted to talk a little bit about salmon
c_dbdcyzc5s_3-5-rgb_front salmon is so popular throughout the world and certainly in the united states
c_dbdcyzc5s_4-5-rgb_front lots of people eat it every single day and the best kind of salmon is a pacific northwest salmon
c_dbdcyzc5s_5-5-rgb_front this happens to be atlantic salmon
c_dbdcyzc5s_6-5-rgb_front let me talk about the pacific salmon for a minute
c_dbdcyzc5s_7-5-rgb_front it is the most prized of all the salmon in the world it is the best the freshest the most delicious and whenever you can get wild seafood of any kind do that as opposed to farm and seafood
c_dbdcyzc5s_8-5-rgb_front salmon is really interesting that they live in both freshwater and saltwater
c_dbdcyzc5s_9-5-rgb_front they go to freshwater to breed and after they breed they die
c_l5ztwzljm_1-11-rgb_front in this segment i want to discuss how very important it is i want to stress to you not to confuse your child when you are doing potty training
c_l5ztwzljm_2-11-rgb_front it is really important not to put them in underwear one day and put them in a diaper another day or do the same in one day
c_l5ztwzljm_3-11-rgb_front because it will confuse the child and you either just want to when you are ready to potty train put them in underwear and keep them only in underwear
c_l5ztwzljm_4-11-rgb_front if you go from diaper to underwear it is way too confusing for you and them and then they are not going to ever want just to wear underwear
c_l5ztwzljm_5-11-rgb_front they are only going to want to wear a diaper
c_l5ztwzljm_6-11-rgb_front so when you decide to potty train keep your child in underwear
c_l5ztwzljm_7-11-rgb_front except the evening you can put on a diaper or a pamper for when they go to sleep
c_wfqbpxfjg_2-5-rgb_front and have your feet about maybe a foot and a half to two feet away from the wall and then stretch your arms up overhead and place your fingertips on the wall so it is like you make suction cups with your hands
c_wfqbpxfjg_3-5-rgb_front you place your fingertips on the wall then push into the wall actively through your arms and from that expansion engage the muscles and draw back into yourself moving the heads of the arm bones back and the shoulder blades into the upper back
c_wfqbpxfjg_4-5-rgb_front with your breath expand again and then enjoy the stretch as you melt the heart toward the wall
c_wfqbpxfjg_5-5-rgb_front keep looking straight ahead so the throat stays in line with the shoulders and the eyes are even with the floor
c_wfqbpxfjg_6-5-rgb_front take a few more breaths
c_wfqbpxfjg_7-5-rgb_front and with your inhalation you can lift back up and release your arms by your sides
c_ufvoldox8_0-8-rgb_front alright in this segment we are going to go over the lob serve
c_ufvoldox8_1-8-rgb_front i think the lob serves are one of the best weapons that you have in a game
c_ufvoldox8_11-8-rgb_front and on the next segment we are going to explore a little more of the lob serve on the forehand side
c_ufvoldox8_2-8-rgb_front every point of it starts off with one person serving
c_ufvoldox8_3-8-rgb_front so the lob serve means we are going to hit the ball real high off the front wall and it is going to go on a diagonal and hopefully it comes out on a very steep angle to your opponent force them to hit a high back hand if they are a right hander
canylzx_uye_4-5-rgb_front but another thing that you could use if you are in a hurry you could drop a few of the denture tablets in your water and leave it and it will foam and clean and then when you come this is a good one for people that work and they want to clean a little bit while they are gone and then they come back and just swish around
canylzx_uye_5-5-rgb_front but today i am going to take the powder and i am going to use a little bit of elbow grease and just scrub
canylzx_uye_6-5-rgb_front if you have time sometimes you get let it sit and absorb into the stain and then you are going to need to flush to see if you get it all because the water in this case my water turned blue and if i still see a little bit of stain still there i will just scrub
canylzx_uye_7-5-rgb_front and whenever you use a cleaner in your toilet you want to be sure that you continue to flush it out so i am going to have to wait for my toilet to fill again and then you just want to keep flushing out to be sure you get the dirt out the dirt and the chemical out
canylzx_uye_8-5-rgb_front this is ann myrick and that is how you clean a toilet ring
cd2bsk73yqo_0-8-rgb_front the possibilities are really endless for what subject matter and how you want to carve the block and how you want to use the block of wood for carving
cd2bsk73yqo_1-8-rgb_front it really is going to be dependent on how you work with the wood and what you are want to get from that piece of wood
cd2bsk73yqo_10-8-rgb_front and try to get that into the wood
cd2bsk73yqo_11-8-rgb_front how you are going to carve your block of wood what subject matter you are going to bring to it is really going to depend on what you want to say
cd2bsk73yqo_12-8-rgb_front it may take a little bit of time for you to get a handle on how to translate what it is you want to say into the block of wood
cd2bsk73yqo_13-8-rgb_front but that is part of the beauty of learning about relief printmaking and learning about wood
cd2bsk73yqo_2-8-rgb_front here are three blocks of wood each of these are on a different kind of wood
cd2bsk73yqo_3-8-rgb_front both of these are sheen applied
cd2bsk73yqo_4-8-rgb_front this is three ply and five ply
cd2bsk73yqo_5-8-rgb_front here is an industrial piece of plywood that was available to me and i carved it
cd2bsk73yqo_6-8-rgb_front here is in that print where i get some more of the rougher carve marks around the edges
cd2bsk73yqo_7-8-rgb_front and they each are showing something a different way to get imagery out of the wood
cd2bsk73yqo_8-8-rgb_front where here is going to be a more of a blanket area of raised wood that is going to give me one solid image
cd2bsk73yqo_9-8-rgb_front here i am getting a more draftsmanship quality where i was really trying to emulate my drawing my rapid drawing of my pencil
cdax8mdsjkc_0-5-rgb_front hi
cdax8mdsjkc_10-5-rgb_front and what we are going to do is cut off both ends
cdax8mdsjkc_11-5-rgb_front what i like to do is real simple
cdax8mdsjkc_12-5-rgb_front just cut it in half
cdax8mdsjkc_13-5-rgb_front make sure you wash your veggies really good
cdax8mdsjkc_14-5-rgb_front alright
cdax8mdsjkc_15-5-rgb_front what i do is just cut this bad boy in half
cdax8mdsjkc_16-5-rgb_front put the flat side down
cdax8mdsjkc_17-5-rgb_front i will cut it in half again like so
cdax8mdsjkc_18-5-rgb_front i will do the same thing to the other one
cdax8mdsjkc_19-5-rgb_front now this was a big sized eggplant
cdax8mdsjkc_2-5-rgb_front alright before we start with our eggplant beautiful eggplant by the way make sure you lower that flame and just let that simmer
cdax8mdsjkc_20-5-rgb_front so what i am going to do now is just coming back make it like one inch pieces
cdax8mdsjkc_21-5-rgb_front this is such a big eggplant i am actually going to slice it again here just to make the cubes more symmetrical
cdax8mdsjkc_22-5-rgb_front remember what i am going to do is just cut about an inch back
cdax8mdsjkc_23-5-rgb_front and you will see you will have nice size pieces that way
cdax8mdsjkc_24_25_26-5-rgb_front and like i said this is going to cook down there is a lot of water in this i am going to try to get all of that flavors of this beautiful eggplant
cdax8mdsjkc_27-5-rgb_front eggplant is i tell you it is delicious and it is good for you
cdax8mdsjkc_28-5-rgb_front so again if you have some big pieces like this you might want to cut this down too
cdax8mdsjkc_3-5-rgb_front that paste and that garlic
cdax8mdsjkc_4-5-rgb_front and while that is simmering now we are going to start to chop this beautiful eggplant
cdax8mdsjkc_5-5-rgb_front alright the first thing you are going to do is chop off the end of the stem where the top is of the eggplant
cdax8mdsjkc_6-5-rgb_front to get a beautiful eggplant make sure they are get a beautiful eggplant make sure they are not bruised anywhere they are firm to the touch
cdax8mdsjkc_7-5-rgb_front listen to that
cdax8mdsjkc_8-5-rgb_front you can hear it it is nice and firm
cdax8mdsjkc_9-5-rgb_front beautiful
cekujp1wr9o_0-5-rgb_front hi
cekujp1wr9o_2-5-rgb_front in this video clip i will be answering the question what is engine coolant
cekujp1wr9o_3-5-rgb_front in an engine the temperature can get to a very hot temperature and there is fluid that travels through many of the holes in the engine and this will help dissipate the heat
cekujp1wr9o_4-5-rgb_front the fluid is called antifreeze also known as engine coolant
cekujp1wr9o_5-5-rgb_front the reason we use coolant is because although water will do about the same thing water freezes when it gets too cold and it boils when it gets too hot
cekujp1wr9o_6-5-rgb_front by mixing antifreeze with the water it will lower the freezing point and will raise the boiling point of the liquid
cekujp1wr9o_7-5-rgb_front because the engine does get really hot we add the antifreeze mixture so that it will help protect the engine better and have a less likelihood of boiling inside the engine
cerg8jkzdie_0-8-rgb_front in this segment i am going to talk about keeping your head down
cerg8jkzdie_1-8-rgb_front well in baseball it is not called keeping your head down although in baseball what happens sometimes is that someone will pull their head off the ball you have seen that and you have heard about that
cerg8jkzdie_10-8-rgb_front it is very hard to see in baseball or in golf but if you are looking down there and you try to watch it watch that club hit the ball watch it
cerg8jkzdie_11-8-rgb_front watch that club hit the ball watch it
cerg8jkzdie_12-8-rgb_front that is the way to keep your head down
cerg8jkzdie_13-8-rgb_front we all know how many people move their head in golf as they come into the impact area
cerg8jkzdie_14-8-rgb_front oh boy look what that does to my body but if i try to watch this club hit that ball baseball address baseball grip watch it hit boom
cerg8jkzdie_15-8-rgb_front watch it hit boom
cerg8jkzdie_16-8-rgb_front that is the greatest way to keep your head down
cerg8jkzdie_2-8-rgb_front what solution what though do they give you in baseball
cerg8jkzdie_3-8-rgb_front what have you heard so many times in baseball to solve moving your head
cerg8jkzdie_4-8-rgb_front what do they say
cerg8jkzdie_5-8-rgb_front watch the bat hit the ball
cerg8jkzdie_6-8-rgb_front watch the bat hit the ball what a beautiful thought
cerg8jkzdie_7-8-rgb_front so that ball is coming but you are trying to watch it you are trying to watch that bat hit the ball
cerg8jkzdie_8-8-rgb_front you are trying to watch that bat hit the ball
cerg8jkzdie_9-8-rgb_front if you are really buying into this and you want to try to hit a golf ball like a baseball try to watch the club hit the ball try to see it
cf7s3sct3po_0-5-rgb_front hi this is liz muller from liz is hair design in hollywood florida
cf7s3sct3po_1-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to show you how to make a hair wrap
cf7s3sct3po_10-5-rgb_front and you want to use a little product a very small amount maybe a little slim del lino and just go like that to the hair
cf7s3sct3po_11-5-rgb_front and that is why you are going to pick up this brush next because see all the little fine hairs you are going to go ahead and brush those real straight flat
cf7s3sct3po_12-5-rgb_front nice and soft really nice and easy get every little hair there
cf7s3sct3po_13-5-rgb_front placing it nice and then we are going to use the hair wrap and you are going to put it on the hair
cf7s3sct3po_14-5-rgb_front you are going to remove that pin in a minute but you are going to wrap the hair like that
cf7s3sct3po_15-5-rgb_front this is liz muller and this is how you make a hair wrap
cf7s3sct3po_2-5-rgb_front now we are going to wrap this hair i am going to do it dry
cf7s3sct3po_3-5-rgb_front you are going to need a hair net a brush paddle brush you are also going to need a bristle brush because you want to smooth the hair out later on
cf7s3sct3po_4-5-rgb_front taking it sections at a time we are going to go around the hair placing the hair in the middle going around the head nice and neatly like this
cf7s3sct3po_5-5-rgb_front make sure this is down here
cf7s3sct3po_6-5-rgb_front now if you have a problem with that section here and you have a lot of hair it is giving you a problem you could put a clip there so it does not get in the way you can remove it afterwords ok
cf7s3sct3po_7-5-rgb_front so just go around the hair continue to go around and around
cf7s3sct3po_8-5-rgb_front it it was wet you would put like an actual thin piece of paper around it it is really done easy too but we are doing it dry
cf7s3sct3po_9-5-rgb_front going to smooth it out like that you might want to use a little product on it to just keep those little hairs down
cftmkqnnfy4_0-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about how to define an income statement
cftmkqnnfy4_1-5-rgb_front an income statement summarizes the revenues earned and the expenses incurred over a period of time
cftmkqnnfy4_2-5-rgb_front a balance sheet talks about where you stand at the end of a period or as of a certain date
cftmkqnnfy4_3-5-rgb_front an income statement talks about what happens over a period of time so throughout the month of january we earned x numbers of dollars
cftmkqnnfy4_4-5-rgb_front here is an example of a very simple income statement
cftmkqnnfy4_5-5-rgb_front at the top we show the revenue or the amounts earned in this example it was a dollars
cftmkqnnfy4_6-5-rgb_front next we would show the expenses in this example dollars and at the bottom we get net income how much money that company earned over that period in this example it was dollars so we have revenue of a minus expenses of for a net income of
cftmkqnnfy4_7-5-rgb_front and that is how you define an income statement
cgyzsoc41mc_0-5-rgb_front the front side smith grind
cgyzsoc41mc_1-5-rgb_front the front side smith grind is a cool trick because it started out on vert and on pools and on ramps first
cgyzsoc41mc_2-5-rgb_front what the skater does is rides up the transition and goes into grind and a board slide on one side of the board at the same time and then comes back in
cgyzsoc41mc_3-5-rgb_front now the modern street style maneuver is exactly the same except now you ollie up onto the ledge above it land in the smith grind and then pop off land and roll away
cgyzsoc41mc_4-5-rgb_front so what you do for a smith grind is you put all your weight on just your back truck
cgyzsoc41mc_5-5-rgb_front the front foot is almost just hovering there keeping the foot and the board in the steady down position and then you pop out at the end
cgyzsoc41mc_6-5-rgb_front what is cool about smith grinds is that since your wheels are below the edge of the top of the ledge you are able to actually get a lot of pop to get you out of the smith grind
cgyzsoc41mc_7-5-rgb_front so it can be a pretty stylish trick to do because you can get in grind and then actually pop out cleanly and roll away
cgyzsoc41mc_8-5-rgb_front so this the front side smith grinds
cgyznu5imtq_0-4-rgb_front dixon gillette all right
cgyznu5imtq_1-4-rgb_front to begin laying single track you are going to want to start out at your city that you are over
cgyznu5imtq_10-4-rgb_front so we are going to go over here to the cornfields and build our track there
cgyznu5imtq_11-4-rgb_front to actually build the track you are going to again
cgyznu5imtq_12-4-rgb_front and as you can see the track is actually built now
cgyznu5imtq_13-4-rgb_front now as you could see if you keep dragging your mouse out you are still in track laying mode
cgyznu5imtq_14-4-rgb_front so you are going to want to exit your track laying mode by on your mouse
cgyznu5imtq_15-4-rgb_front now one thing that is important to keep in mind is that when you are laying track you are going to want to make sure that you have brought your track all the way within the green circle of the industry or city
cgyznu5imtq_16-4-rgb_front if you do not bring it within this transparent green circle you are going to find that you will not be able to build a depot there so make sure that you always bring it within the green circle
cgyznu5imtq_17-4-rgb_front and those are the basics of laying single track
cgyznu5imtq_2-4-rgb_front now one thing that is important to keep in mind when laying track is you can only build track off of existing track
cgyznu5imtq_3-4-rgb_front you can not just start track out in the middle of nowhere
cgyznu5imtq_4-4-rgb_front to begin you are going to want to select your single track icon here or push t on your keyboard
cgyznu5imtq_5-4-rgb_front what this will do is this will change your mouse pointer into your track selector
cgyznu5imtq_6-4-rgb_front and when you are not over your track you will see a red circle with an x there
cgyznu5imtq_7-4-rgb_front that means you cannot lay track at that other position
cgyznu5imtq_8-4-rgb_front to change this into the green circle that you want you bring it over the edge of your track and as you can see are mouse pointer changed
cgyznu5imtq_9-4-rgb_front to begin laying the track you are going to your mouse and simply drag your track towards the direction that you want to build in
ch6nqzwwgbw_1-5-rgb_front what we are going to talk about regarding self hypnosis is how do you focus on your feelings in hypnosis
ch6nqzwwgbw_10-5-rgb_front now we have already set the intention that what he wants to be is a competitive golfer not having to compete daily since he is a business owner but have the fun loving spirit and know that he is competing yet he is not taking golf to seriously
ch6nqzwwgbw_11-5-rgb_front that is the intention that he has set for this self hypnotic session
ch6nqzwwgbw_12-5-rgb_front so what he wants to be focusing on is the feelings of being a very happy joyful golfer playing at a competitive level
ch6nqzwwgbw_13-5-rgb_front so brad in hypnosis i am just going to ask you keep focusing on that and if you can just tell us how it is that you feel
ch6nqzwwgbw_14-5-rgb_front how it is that you feel as a competitive golfer knowing that you are fun loving and that you can still compete at a competitive level
ch6nqzwwgbw_15-5-rgb_front what does that feel like to know that about yourself and be there as if you are already in that spot
ch6nqzwwgbw_16-5-rgb_front i feel very relaxed and calm
ch6nqzwwgbw_17-5-rgb_front he is feels very relaxed and calm
ch6nqzwwgbw_18-5-rgb_front very good
ch6nqzwwgbw_19-5-rgb_front i feel very confident over the shot
ch6nqzwwgbw_2-5-rgb_front well one important thing to know before we actually get into that is to know that when you are in hypnosis you have the uncanny ability to feel much more deeply than you do in an awake state
ch6nqzwwgbw_20-5-rgb_front he feels very confident
ch6nqzwwgbw_21-5-rgb_front excellent
ch6nqzwwgbw_22-5-rgb_front so this is how he focuses on his feelings
ch6nqzwwgbw_23-5-rgb_front he thinks about his intention and then he puts himself in that place as if he is already there
ch6nqzwwgbw_24-5-rgb_front and he can actually feel himself being in the place that he already wants to be in
ch6nqzwwgbw_25-5-rgb_front that is how you focus on your feelings when you are in hypnosis
ch6nqzwwgbw_3-5-rgb_front you also have the ability to see yourself where you want to be
ch6nqzwwgbw_4-5-rgb_front you have the ability to visualize and know
ch6nqzwwgbw_5-5-rgb_front not all of us see things in hypnosis because we may not be visual people
ch6nqzwwgbw_6-5-rgb_front however we do either feel where we want to be or we just somehow know where we want to be and some of us even hear what we want to hear
ch6nqzwwgbw_7-5-rgb_front but here we have brad deep in hypnosis and i am talking i know that i am not disturbing him because he is very practiced at being in hypnosis
ch6nqzwwgbw_8-5-rgb_front but i am going to ask him some questions
ch6nqzwwgbw_9-5-rgb_front i am focusing on his feelings in hypnosis
chtrqv8j3fk_0-8-rgb_front hi
chtrqv8j3fk_1-8-rgb_front this is henry watson with the new bern in new bern north carolina
chtrqv8j3fk_10-8-rgb_front anything closer than that would cause the fire extinguisher to spread the fire
chtrqv8j3fk_11-8-rgb_front anything further away from this distance the fire extinguisher would be ineffective
chtrqv8j3fk_12-8-rgb_front it is important to remember the maximum working distance of the fire extinguisher that you are using
chtrqv8j3fk_13-8-rgb_front in this case eight to twelve feet
chtrqv8j3fk_2-8-rgb_front in this segment we are going to talk about the maximum working distance of the fire extinguisher
chtrqv8j3fk_3-8-rgb_front the fire extinguisher has a working range of eight to twelve feet
chtrqv8j3fk_4-8-rgb_front this is the starting distance that you would use to put out an ordinary combustible fire
chtrqv8j3fk_5-8-rgb_front the maximum working distance is from eight to twelve feet
chtrqv8j3fk_6-8-rgb_front aim at the base of the fire
chtrqv8j3fk_7-8-rgb_front if you are too close to the fire then the extinguishing agent may cause the fire to spread
chtrqv8j3fk_8-8-rgb_front also if you are too close to the fire you may be burned or the flames could change directions and cause you burns
chtrqv8j3fk_9-8-rgb_front the maximum working distance is between eight and twelve feet about the distance that i am standing here
chwhbubzc3e_0-8-rgb_front now we have our balance we come to the balance of system where we tell what else is needed to actually make all this work together
chwhbubzc3e_1-8-rgb_front so to actually get our solar system installed we of course have to mount it on the roof which takes some rails and special mounting clips
chwhbubzc3e_2-8-rgb_front we will also be powering up one or more types of inverters
chwhbubzc3e_3-8-rgb_front we will be using a charge controller
chwhbubzc3e_4-8-rgb_front we have got various sizes of wire to make the system work as well as some fuses and of course a different styles of batteries
chwhbubzc3e_5-8-rgb_front so the balance of system or bos really depends on what size system you are installing
chwhbubzc3e_6-8-rgb_front a full grid tie system would use a lot different parts than a small battery powered system and a small battery powered system uses actually some very large cables where a grid tied system does not
ci8otvmizju_0-5-rgb_front hello
ci8otvmizju_1-5-rgb_front we are back
ci8otvmizju_10-5-rgb_front pass me the mohee mohee
ci8otvmizju_11-5-rgb_front you can do it like a sailor
ci8otvmizju_12-5-rgb_front you can do you a higher pitch
ci8otvmizju_13-5-rgb_front i want to talk like this or i want to talk like that with a lower pitch
ci8otvmizju_14-5-rgb_front you can adjust the rate
ci8otvmizju_15-5-rgb_front you can talk really fast
ci8otvmizju_16-5-rgb_front maybe you want to talk this fast or you can talk very slowly and methodically as a puppet
ci8otvmizju_17-5-rgb_front maybe you want to throw some other elements all together like a lisp
ci8otvmizju_18-5-rgb_front maybe he talks like this
ci8otvmizju_19-5-rgb_front he can not say certain letters so he lisps a little bit
ci8otvmizju_20-5-rgb_front either way you are going to want to practice
ci8otvmizju_21-5-rgb_front like we mentioned use your tools record it listen to the voice and test it out on some of your friends
ci8otvmizju_22-5-rgb_front are they getting good response
ci8otvmizju_23-5-rgb_front do they like your voice
ci8otvmizju_24-5-rgb_front is your character is voice engaging
ci8otvmizju_25-5-rgb_front is it something that you want to carry with you and go through many routines with
ci8otvmizju_3-5-rgb_front in this segment we are going to tackle choosing a voice
ci8otvmizju_4-5-rgb_front some people think do you choose the character first and then the voice or the voice and then the character
ci8otvmizju_5-5-rgb_front it is up to you
ci8otvmizju_6-5-rgb_front in this segment we are going to just handle how to choose a voice
ci8otvmizju_7-5-rgb_front there is very many ways to do it
ci8otvmizju_8-5-rgb_front you can pick it through an accent
ci8otvmizju_9-5-rgb_front take for instance a british accent
cisouhvr7um_1-8-rgb_front okay a couple of more accessories for your nurse costume
cisouhvr7um_10-8-rgb_front yet you can tear it pretty easily as well
cisouhvr7um_11-8-rgb_front so this is a really nice fun effect to your nurse costume to where you can kind of bring in more of the trapping of a nurse into your party
cisouhvr7um_12-8-rgb_front another thing which you can also add for some humor are latex gloves
cisouhvr7um_13-8-rgb_front these of course are used when nurses want to watch out about germs or other nasties in treating their patients and in not spreading them to others
cisouhvr7um_14-8-rgb_front it is a sanitary precautionary measure
cisouhvr7um_15-8-rgb_front so you can of course have these gloves on
cisouhvr7um_16-8-rgb_front you may get a lot of interesting questions about them but they are a very fun nurse accessory
cisouhvr7um_2-8-rgb_front the first is bandages and nurses of course are known for giving medical aid and attention and bandages are a nice easy low lying fruit to add to your nurse costume
cisouhvr7um_3-8-rgb_front how do you do this
cisouhvr7um_4-8-rgb_front go out and get party streamers
cisouhvr7um_5-8-rgb_front white is the best color for this
cisouhvr7um_6-8-rgb_front it makes an easy bandage
cisouhvr7um_7-8-rgb_front you can even go around the party or your halloween gathering and bandage people up throughout the evening
cisouhvr7um_8-8-rgb_front simply applying by unrolling it over
cisouhvr7um_9-8-rgb_front it is nice and resilient
cjdcplmzmc0_0-3-rgb_front now the next thing is focusing the energy of the group and this this is obviously not if you are a speaker because there is no group
cjdcplmzmc0_1_2-3-rgb_front it is just simply you unless you are speaking in a consortium and there is a number of you but if you are an actor if you are getting ready to do a play any kind of group what you want to do is focus the energy of the group and there are several activities that you can do to do this
cjdcplmzmc0_3-3-rgb_front maybe you want to do some improvisation or simply doing ice breakers like the pulse game where everybody stands in a circle and you send the pulse around the circle
cjdcplmzmc0_4-3-rgb_front everybody holds hands standing in a circle
cjdcplmzmc0_5-3-rgb_front i squeeze the person next to me is hand and they pass it on and it comes all the way back around the circle to me or perhaps you play a name game where each person in the circle says their name and does a gesture or says their name and says something that they like and they go all the way around the room
cjdcplmzmc0_6-3-rgb_front whatever activity it is it is getting the group connected getting the group energy at the same place getting the group in sync with each other
cjdcplmzmc0_7-3-rgb_front so you want to definitely have your individual warm up but you want to have a group get together as well where you do one two maybe three ice breaker or improvisational activities
ck9byvklv-m_0-3-rgb_front andre boulay so the next trick we are going to show you is called leg orbits
ck9byvklv-m_1-3-rgb_front the yoyo is actually going up and around your leg
ck9byvklv-m_10-3-rgb_front so when the yoyo is sitting here i am pulling with this hand which propels it off the string
ck9byvklv-m_11-3-rgb_front it comes over here and this hand helps guide it
ck9byvklv-m_12-3-rgb_front this hand is really not doing too much
ck9byvklv-m_13-3-rgb_front it is just sitting here guiding it as the yoyo comes over
ck9byvklv-m_14-3-rgb_front if it is coming over this way you are going to want to pull the string so it sits into it
ck9byvklv-m_15-3-rgb_front the minute the yoyo hits the string it is just going to spin right down to the other side again and this is where this hand comes and propels it back up over your leg where you once again guide it back down
ck9byvklv-m_16-3-rgb_front so practice that get a good strong throw and eventually you will be able to do this for a really long time that is called leg orbit
ck9byvklv-m_2-3-rgb_front it is pretty cool looking
ck9byvklv-m_3-3-rgb_front i am going to show you what it looks like first
ck9byvklv-m_4-3-rgb_front just throw the yoyo just like so you step over the string like that and we actually do is swing the yoyo around and we will catch on the string just like that
ck9byvklv-m_5-3-rgb_front that is the leg orbit
ck9byvklv-m_6-3-rgb_front so to do this trick what you want to do is when you throw and you step over it
ck9byvklv-m_7-3-rgb_front this is where i am going to stop the yoyo and show you what is happening real quick
ck9byvklv-m_8-3-rgb_front so the yoyo is coming up over the string it is being released off this hand
ck9byvklv-m_9-3-rgb_front this hand is pretty much propelling it
cm8ragn4w0a_0-5-rgb_front in this clip i am going to talk to you about the basic piece that every drum has
cm8ragn4w0a_1-5-rgb_front this is a drum it is actually a tom tom the hi tom of my drum set
cm8ragn4w0a_10-5-rgb_front the bearing edge is the wood the shell that is cut at an angle and the amount of contact wood has with the skin is what determines the sound of the drum
cm8ragn4w0a_11-5-rgb_front so if it is flat if the bearing edge were flat like this the drum sound would be completely dead you would not hear anything
cm8ragn4w0a_12-5-rgb_front so they are cut on angles like that or they can be a little rounded off and sharpened like that and each way they are cut makes it a little different sound
cm8ragn4w0a_13-5-rgb_front this is the tom holder right here
cm8ragn4w0a_14-5-rgb_front this is to hold it up and that is pretty much it for the drum very simple
cm8ragn4w0a_2-5-rgb_front it is made up of the shell which is a cylindrical piece of wood
cm8ragn4w0a_3-5-rgb_front this shell is made of plywood so each piece of wood is glued to each other and wrapped in a circle that is how it is made
cm8ragn4w0a_4-5-rgb_front this here is the hoop and it is made out of wood it can also be made out of metal
cm8ragn4w0a_5-5-rgb_front this is the lug which attaches the drum head to the drum shell
cm8ragn4w0a_6-5-rgb_front this is the drum head and it is made out of plastic
cm8ragn4w0a_7-5-rgb_front back in the day they used to be made out of calf skin
cm8ragn4w0a_8-5-rgb_front those were the original ones
cm8ragn4w0a_9-5-rgb_front but plastic is now preferred because of the sound and its durability and here is the most important part of the drum is the bearing edge
cmfw0p_9tmw_0-8-rgb_front the result of a set is what i just touched on previously in the last segment and i will go into it even a little bit further
cmfw0p_9tmw_1-8-rgb_front now we talked about this thing called the swing
cmfw0p_9tmw_10-8-rgb_front so the point is that the set is what pretty much decided the hands
cmfw0p_9tmw_11-8-rgb_front now another thing that i tell all of my partners to do and i advise people to do is if the bid comes around to fourth seat again let is look at this scenario
cmfw0p_9tmw_12-8-rgb_front this is you here and you are the dealer
cmfw0p_9tmw_13-8-rgb_front this person over here bids a three this person bids a five and this person bids a one
cmfw0p_9tmw_14-8-rgb_front you have a hand that looks like you have got four tricks you are pretty sure of taking four tricks
cmfw0p_9tmw_15-8-rgb_front you might even have ace king queen jack of spades and nothing else
cmfw0p_9tmw_16-8-rgb_front do you push it to thirteen
cmfw0p_9tmw_17-8-rgb_front absolutely no no no no no unless there is a bag situation where toward the end of the game you are risking going out by taking a bag never never never push the bid to thirteen in fourth seat unless the score clearly dictates that
cmfw0p_9tmw_18-8-rgb_front the reason for that is you are partner has put up a big old five if you had all those spades he is bidding five on side suits
cmfw0p_9tmw_19-8-rgb_front if by chance somebody comes in and trumps one of his five tricks and you only have four you are not going to be able to pick him up because you already bid the four that you expected to take
cmfw0p_9tmw_2-8-rgb_front the word swing has nothing to do with the word playground and has nothing to do with dancing
cmfw0p_9tmw_20-8-rgb_front so again the game really clearly focuses on avoiding the sets and the impact of being set
cmfw0p_9tmw_21-8-rgb_front so safety in contracts safety in bidding and particularly when you are bidding numerical bids remember the average bid of a hand is eleven tricks
cmfw0p_9tmw_22-8-rgb_front so when you start pushing it to twelve when you start pushing it to thirteen then you are taking full responsibility you are telling your partner i probably have two extra tricks
cmfw0p_9tmw_23-8-rgb_front so again bid slightly conservatively
cmfw0p_9tmw_3-8-rgb_front it has to do with the loss of points versus the gain of points and again if it is a low level bid it is really not going to matter too much it is not going to hurt you too much
cmfw0p_9tmw_4-8-rgb_front any bids from say two because if you each bid one that is the most even a two bid can split
cmfw0p_9tmw_5-8-rgb_front if your bid is combined then you are bidding one trick and you are bidding one trick
cmfw0p_9tmw_6-8-rgb_front well a couple of my friends said if you can bid one you should bid nil
cmfw0p_9tmw_7-8-rgb_front oh really
cmfw0p_9tmw_8-8-rgb_front if you got the ace of spades are you going to bid nil
cmfw0p_9tmw_9-8-rgb_front if you have got the ace and a jack of clubs are you going to bid a nil
cnd-hsieamg_10-8-rgb_front now the way i throw it there are multiple techniques for throwing back crosses
cnd-hsieamg_11-8-rgb_front different jugglers will teach you different things
cnd-hsieamg_12-8-rgb_front the way i throw is i have the back of my hand perpendicular to my back just like this
cnd-hsieamg_13-8-rgb_front you bring the club around and throw bring around and throw
cnd-hsieamg_14-8-rgb_front so practice this throw with each hand over and over trying to get double spin height and then we will work on incorporating that into a pattern
cnd-hsieamg_9-8-rgb_front what you need to do is you are going to have your hand come around from this throwing pattern pretty high up your back around here and from here you want to be continuing the throw naturally and letting your wrists spin the club up
cnvquixexme_0-8-rgb_front we are going to help this rider now apply some of her knowledge of communication with hand and leg to that forward moving horse that we now want to be balanced smooth and light on their forehand
cnvquixexme_1-8-rgb_front horses inherently like to go out and do their work in a similar sloppy fashion to many of us in our daily lives
cnvquixexme_18-8-rgb_front when this hock bends nicely and that foot can step forward and underneath the horse almost like it were coming into a tight rope that is when that horse can balance itself well and go through the circles
cnvquixexme_19-8-rgb_front so we want a horse that knows how to use their bodies well enough so they can do all of those quick turns and spins and maintain circles as we take them to those disciplines that we hope to compete in
cnycvxfq8h4_0-5-rgb_front hi i am kim with simply beautiful in austin texas
cnycvxfq8h4_1-5-rgb_front let is talk about how to tan without burning
cnycvxfq8h4_10-5-rgb_front a lot of people do not know but the number on a sunscreen stands for how much longer you can stay in the sun with sunscreen on then without
cnycvxfq8h4_11-5-rgb_front so if you burn in minutes you will be able to stay in times longer than that or times or times
cnycvxfq8h4_12-5-rgb_front most people do not really need a
cnycvxfq8h4_13-5-rgb_front so we are just blending it making sure that we get all the delicate areas
cnycvxfq8h4_14-5-rgb_front i do not want you to put sunscreen in your eyes or really closely around your eye area because if there is and it gets in your eyes it will sting
cnycvxfq8h4_15-5-rgb_front so as close to your eye area as you can but not on it
cnycvxfq8h4_16-5-rgb_front do not forget a nice sunblocking lip moisturizer
cnycvxfq8h4_17-5-rgb_front they have them with or even sunscreen
cnycvxfq8h4_2-5-rgb_front almost impossible
cnycvxfq8h4_3-5-rgb_front so what we are going to need to do is build our exposure time in the sun up a little bit at a time say to minutes a day
cnycvxfq8h4_4-5-rgb_front also important of course is sunscreen
cnycvxfq8h4_5-5-rgb_front so you want to apply the sunscreen liberally all over your face and body
cnycvxfq8h4_6-5-rgb_front do not forget your chest your hands and the tops of your feet
cnycvxfq8h4_7-5-rgb_front we are going to just demonstrate on megan just to show you about how much we want to put on her face
cnycvxfq8h4_8-5-rgb_front we are going to use a with megan because megan does not burn very easily because she has olive colored skin
cnycvxfq8h4_9-5-rgb_front those of you who are more fair are going to want to have higher number sunscreen so you want to shoot for a
cqo5c__vk7s_10-1-rgb_front this surface here would be what would be visible in the ear
cqo5c__vk7s_2-1-rgb_front the beige part that is visible there would fit inside the ear canal and it would be flush with the opening or the surface here would be flush with the opening of the ear canal
cqo5c__vk7s_3-1-rgb_front it is virtually invisible and sits very deep in the ear canal
cqo5c__vk7s_4-1-rgb_front that is the smallest that is currently available
cqo5c__vk7s_5-1-rgb_front the next kind size up is what we call an in the canal hearing aid
cqo5c__vk7s_6-1-rgb_front it is a little bit larger it also sits very deep in the ear canal but as you can see the surface is a little bit bigger
cqo5c__vk7s_7-1-rgb_front this is the part that would be visible in the opening of the ear canal
cqo5c__vk7s_8-1-rgb_front the next size up is called an in the ear hearing aid
cqo5c__vk7s_9-1-rgb_front this is larger still and fills more of the ear canal
cr7x2ndnzoa_10-8-rgb_front what we want to remember is when when we bring our finger tips up to our shoulders
cr7x2ndnzoa_11-8-rgb_front we are lightly pressing them down our hands can go back to our side with our shoulders slightly coming backward
cr7x2ndnzoa_12-8-rgb_front this is very important that you attain perfect posture
cr7x2ndnzoa_13-8-rgb_front also what really helps your chest is to pull in your stomach muscles so that then your entire body relaxes and you can just relax as you attain perfect posture
cr7x2ndnzoa_14-8-rgb_front as you can clearly see now i have pressed my shoulders down slightly back and my stomach muscles are in and then a front view of perfect posture
cr7x2ndnzoa_15_16-8-rgb_front you know attaining perfect posture requires practice and it really helps if you have a mirror so you can look in the mirror and see yourself
cr7x2ndnzoa_17-8-rgb_front at a profile and notice if your shoulders are slumped
cr7x2ndnzoa_18-8-rgb_front then you are having bad posture
cr7x2ndnzoa_19-8-rgb_front you can notice in the mirror by pulling the shoulders up
cr7x2ndnzoa_9-8-rgb_front you clearly pull in the stomach muscles and it relaxes your whole body
cr_1k4jsyce_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to look at the space that occurs between letters and i am sorry to say i do not have a formula for you for how they fit together because letters are all different shapes
cr_1k4jsyce_1-8-rgb_front so i think it is good to practice words and to look at the way letters fit together in words
cr_1k4jsyce_2-8-rgb_front for example if i have a word that has two o is i am probably going to put them a little closer and i will make a word that has two l is of course i am skipping the whole rest of the word
cr_1k4jsyce_3-8-rgb_front if we analyze the space that is in between these two letters we are going to say well my goodness that space is extremely thin and we will look at the space between the l is and say well at least double that space
cr_1k4jsyce_4-8-rgb_front because the letters themselves some space so we have got some extra space occurring here and here which we do not have on the l is we are going to open up the space between l is and close up the space between o is
cr_1k4jsyce_5-8-rgb_front and as we look at some other possibilities of combinations for example when i have the letter r the letter r builds its own space so i leave very little space if i am writing the letter run why do not i write run and show you so that the space here is quite narrow and the space here is wider
cr_1k4jsyce_6-8-rgb_front so we really make our letter spacing based on the shapes of the letters that we are combining
cr_1k4jsyce_7-8-rgb_front and that is going to help us to make an even pattern of writing across the page
cr_1k4jsyce_8-8-rgb_front so again i think it is helpful to practice a word that you think you might have trouble spacing a couple of times
csdpa_b5p8q_0-5-rgb_front so how do you tell the quality of tea
csdpa_b5p8q_1-5-rgb_front the quality of tea comes from different places
csdpa_b5p8q_10-5-rgb_front and the flavor of the tea should be very present even if you are drinking a white tea that you think is a very mild tea so you should not really taste the tea
csdpa_b5p8q_11-5-rgb_front but the sweetness of the white tea will come out when it is fresh and if it is a good quality tea
csdpa_b5p8q_12-5-rgb_front thank you
csdpa_b5p8q_2-5-rgb_front the leaf the type of leafs what it looks like before it is brewed what it looks like after it is been brewed
csdpa_b5p8q_3-5-rgb_front also the aroma of the tea leaves before you brew it
csdpa_b5p8q_4-5-rgb_front if it smells if there is no scent that the tea leaves impart before it touches water it might be a tea that is been on the counter or on sale for a bit long
csdpa_b5p8q_5-5-rgb_front you want to get a tea that imparts a certain aroma
csdpa_b5p8q_6-5-rgb_front and if you get once you have smelled it you want to brew the leaf and once you brew the tea leaf and the aroma from the cup has to be stronger or impart something similar of the dry leaf brew but much stronger
csdpa_b5p8q_7-5-rgb_front and the other thing is the to look at the clarity of the color of the brew
csdpa_b5p8q_8-5-rgb_front if you get a a longjing or dragon well which is a very popular chinese green tea the brew will be very clear
csdpa_b5p8q_9-5-rgb_front if it is cloudy it means you have got dust in the tea leaves and it also might be old
cssfh2ujyxw_0-5-rgb_front proper golf course etiquette is a very very important part of the golf game
cssfh2ujyxw_1-5-rgb_front my name is jared garbett with echo farms country club and i am going to teach you how to practice proper golf etiquette
cssfh2ujyxw_10-5-rgb_front just being generally respectful of the people in your group the people in front of and the people behind you is perfect
cssfh2ujyxw_11-5-rgb_front just practice the golden rule
cssfh2ujyxw_12-5-rgb_front do unto others as you would have them do unto you
cssfh2ujyxw_13-5-rgb_front do not hit into the group in front of you and do not hold up the group behind you
cssfh2ujyxw_14-5-rgb_front that is how you practice proper golf etiquette
cssfh2ujyxw_2-5-rgb_front before arriving at the course you need to call ahead and make a tee time
cssfh2ujyxw_3-5-rgb_front this lets the golf course know that you are coming so that they do not book somebody else in your spot
cssfh2ujyxw_4-5-rgb_front you also want to check for any specific regulations that the golf course may have as far as dress code wearing proper golf attire collared shirts pants and what types of shoes you need to wear
cssfh2ujyxw_5-5-rgb_front making sure that you play fast whenever you get to the golf course is extremely important as well
cssfh2ujyxw_6-5-rgb_front you should never take any more than four and a half hours to play eighteen holes of golf
cssfh2ujyxw_7-5-rgb_front while you are out on the course you want to make sure you are quiet while other people are hitting
cssfh2ujyxw_8-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that you never stand in front of anybody as they get ready to hit their golf shot
cssfh2ujyxw_9-5-rgb_front whenever it is your turn to hit your shot you need to make sure that you are ready and you take your time when hitting the shot but do not take any more time than you need
ctli0zlqlxk_0-3-rgb_front now there is over hookah bars in the nation
ctli0zlqlxk_1-3-rgb_front i am sure you can find one locally but what you should expect from going to a hookah bar
ctli0zlqlxk_10-3-rgb_front so five hours is definitely not uncommon for people to relax and invite your friends to come in and they slowly come in and they join you and keep ordering hookahs
ctli0zlqlxk_11-3-rgb_front you can have many hookahs on your table so that is a little bit of what you can expect going out to a hookah bar
ctli0zlqlxk_2-3-rgb_front a lot of time are middle eastern owned
ctli0zlqlxk_3-3-rgb_front a lot of them are coffee shops do not have drinks they just have the hookah
ctli0zlqlxk_4-3-rgb_front you can drink tea and coffee but if you are going to go out to one of the night club versions such as are we expect kind of a different experience
ctli0zlqlxk_5-3-rgb_front it is not quite as laid back it is a little more of a night club experience
ctli0zlqlxk_6-3-rgb_front most of them are quite swanky so i would dress up and when you go to a hookah bar it is not like going to the bar down the street
ctli0zlqlxk_7-3-rgb_front it is not like that where you just go in and have a quick pint and leave
ctli0zlqlxk_8-3-rgb_front the customers here they lounge out all night
ctli0zlqlxk_9-3-rgb_front we our normal customer average i would say they are here for at least three hours and many many times we have customers here that get here at p m and they do not leave until
cu1rdgwoz9w_0-8-rgb_front how do you create your own step pretty much all the time comes from your heart
cu1rdgwoz9w_1-8-rgb_front comes a little bit more how you feel the music
cu1rdgwoz9w_11-8-rgb_front when the music goes a little bit fast and when the music kicks a little bit higher and this is when i like to create my own step
cu1rdgwoz9w_12-8-rgb_front so i like everything just pretty much fast and move and pretty much have me excited with that the extra beat of music they have
cu1rdgwoz9w_13-8-rgb_front so do not worry about it if you need to create your own step the only thing you need to do is turn up the music put some music and just let it go
cu1rdgwoz9w_14-8-rgb_front okay
cu1rdgwoz9w_15-8-rgb_front see you in the next step
cu1rdgwoz9w_2-8-rgb_front yeah
cu1rdgwoz9w_3-8-rgb_front it is very simple how to create your step if you feel the music
cu1rdgwoz9w_4-8-rgb_front so every time you want to create your own step just put the music listen to the music just put out a little bit loud if you are driving even if you are home you can put the music you can start doing some homework all around the house you can do everything pretty much that you love to do like put some music on it
cu1rdgwoz9w_5-8-rgb_front like for example fixing your car or be outside your house or be inside your house whatever you all the time for creating your own step you are going to need your music
cu1rdgwoz9w_6-8-rgb_front yes
cu1rdgwoz9w_7-8-rgb_front put the music feel it and like i said before if you feel if it feels good it is going to look good
cu1rdgwoz9w_8_9_10-8-rgb_front do not worry about it okay so all the time try to use your body as a tool and however you feel the music for me it has to be fast
cuqr-bvlu9k_0-8-rgb_front the next thing i am going to talk to you about is chest lifts with accent
cuqr-bvlu9k_1-8-rgb_front we are going to add the accent to the chest lift that we just learned
cuqr-bvlu9k_10-8-rgb_front up real sharp and drop slow
cuqr-bvlu9k_11-8-rgb_front up real sharp and drop slow
cuqr-bvlu9k_12-8-rgb_front we can also put the accents on the bottom
cuqr-bvlu9k_13-8-rgb_front so what we are going to do is we are going to drop real heavy and lift
cuqr-bvlu9k_14-8-rgb_front drop and lift drop and lift drop and lift drop and lift
cuqr-bvlu9k_15-8-rgb_front now from there you can pick up the pace
cuqr-bvlu9k_16-8-rgb_front we will put the accent on the top
cuqr-bvlu9k_17-8-rgb_front so lift two three four five six seven eight and drop one two three four five six seven eight
cuqr-bvlu9k_18-8-rgb_front that is your chest lift with accent
cuqr-bvlu9k_2-8-rgb_front again it is very important to keep yourself in correct posture tail bone tucked under knees slightly bent chest lifted
cuqr-bvlu9k_3-8-rgb_front you want to make sure your chin is level
cuqr-bvlu9k_4-8-rgb_front so for the chest lift going back to the chest lift lift and drop lift and drop lift and drop
cuqr-bvlu9k_5-8-rgb_front again right here from the rib cage lift and drop lift and drop
cuqr-bvlu9k_6-8-rgb_front keeping the shoulders at a level pace here
cuqr-bvlu9k_7-8-rgb_front lift and drop
cuqr-bvlu9k_8-8-rgb_front now we are going to add the accents
cuqr-bvlu9k_9-8-rgb_front what you want to do is you want to put the accents on the ups so when you come up up real sharp drop slow
cxt4a1gtkjo_0-1-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson and what we are talking about right now is how to become a good shooter off the move in a good fundamental way
cxt4a1gtkjo_1-1-rgb_front and one of the best fundamental ways we can do is the shot fake and drive
cxt4a1gtkjo_10-1-rgb_front you do not want to dribble to the side
cxt4a1gtkjo_11-1-rgb_front if he shot fakes and dribbles to the side then he is not going towards the basket
cxt4a1gtkjo_12-1-rgb_front his defender all he has to do is just take a step and he is still in contact with him
cxt4a1gtkjo_13-1-rgb_front he wants to dribble towards the basket and then make the shot
cxt4a1gtkjo_14-1-rgb_front so it is going to look like this
cxt4a1gtkjo_15-1-rgb_front shot fake dribble and he makes the shot
cxt4a1gtkjo_16-1-rgb_front good
cxt4a1gtkjo_17-1-rgb_front so shot fake dribble towards the basket set yourself up for a good shot off the move and then knock down the shot
cxt4a1gtkjo_18-1-rgb_front that is how you become a good shooter off the move
cxt4a1gtkjo_2-1-rgb_front now a shot fake is a very big tool to use against the defense because everybody wants to block the shot
cxt4a1gtkjo_3-1-rgb_front so if i am a defender and i see him get the ball and he is showing me a shot the first thing i am going to do is i am going to come jumping up here to block his shot every single time
cxt4a1gtkjo_4-1-rgb_front and that is going to get me off balance it is going to get me out of the way i normally play and so this guy is going to be able to drive around me almost every time
cxt4a1gtkjo_5-1-rgb_front so what we are going to do is we are going to have him shot fake
cxt4a1gtkjo_6-1-rgb_front now when you shot fake it is very important not to move your feet
cxt4a1gtkjo_7-1-rgb_front you do not want to shot fake and take a step and then take another step or it is going to be a travel
cxt4a1gtkjo_8-1-rgb_front so you want to catch the ball shot fake do not move your head keep your eyes locked on the him
cxt4a1gtkjo_9-1-rgb_front you want to shot fake and then cross the ball low go past your defender
cxwzh1-ulnk_0-3-rgb_front what is up it is james
cxwzh1-ulnk_1-3-rgb_front alright so i am going to basically take through real quick my set up that i have with my detergent and stuff like that
cxwzh1-ulnk_2-3-rgb_front so i am kind of a brand junkie and i have been using tide since when i was born and i continue to use tide and i like tide tide smells fantastic
cxwzh1-ulnk_3-3-rgb_front there is obviously like so many different options out there for you detergent for your bleach for you are dryer sheets for you are fabric softeners
cxwzh1-ulnk_4-3-rgb_front so i mean you can not really go like that wrong like i mean we are in america and like america is all about choice and advertising and the tide companies got me hooked so that is you know that is fine
cxwzh1-ulnk_5-3-rgb_front but like figure out what works for you as far as stuff goes like also educate yourself though that like i mean as far as just detergent goes like this stuff is just liquid just see if we can get the camera like you just pour yours like that
cxwzh1-ulnk_6-3-rgb_front like there is there is powder detergent there is i do not know all different kinds and there is stuff like specifically for colors or specifically for whites
cylfngmzmc0_0-8-rgb_front side flexion sitting on the ball with the weights by the side is an option if you can do this exercise standing up
cylfngmzmc0_1-8-rgb_front i am going to warn you that you must have small weights because if the weights are too big they are really going to interfere the size is going to interfere with the ball
cylfngmzmc0_10-8-rgb_front so you are kind of have a smaller base for your support of on the ball that you are sitting
cylfngmzmc0_11-8-rgb_front and again you want to make sure that you keep the weights small or maybe you have wrist weights wrist bands that you can wear instead because weights are going to be a problem with the size and the ball being right there where the path of the weights need to be
cylfngmzmc0_12-8-rgb_front so again also keep in mind that the head wants to go with the rest of the spine none of that or none of that
cylfngmzmc0_13-8-rgb_front so you want to make sure that maybe you check in the mirror or in the reflection or somebody spot you for a bit until your muscle memory develops do a feel on each side and you are on a way to a happy healthy core
cylfngmzmc0_14-8-rgb_front see you soon
cylfngmzmc0_2-8-rgb_front so it is not a good idea if you are ready to use heavier weights
cylfngmzmc0_3-8-rgb_front this is for lighter weights or no weights if you are starting to train your core and you need to start just learning how to do the exercise
cylfngmzmc0_4-8-rgb_front now sitting on the fitness ball it is going to take you to where you are sitting on your sit bones and you are spine is going to be align shoulders down and back
cylfngmzmc0_5-8-rgb_front so you are chest is open and up
cylfngmzmc0_6-8-rgb_front so none of this okay
cylfngmzmc0_7-8-rgb_front now the weights by the side you are going to keep your head align as you take an inhale and take a side it is like a side crunch
cylfngmzmc0_8-8-rgb_front exhale as you are coming up inhale exhale inhale exhale
cylfngmzmc0_9-8-rgb_front now way to make it a little more challenging on the balance is maybe lifting your heels off the floor
cylhtiqmitc_0-8-rgb_front this exercise is large arm circles
cylhtiqmitc_1-8-rgb_front and once again we are going to spread the band out flat and we are going to sit in the middle of it
cylhtiqmitc_2-8-rgb_front grabbing the ends of the band between the forefingers and the thumb we are going to go ahead and take a nice inhale exhale stabilize the abdominals and bring the arms up inhale back exhale around
cylhtiqmitc_3-8-rgb_front inhale up exhale
cylhtiqmitc_4-8-rgb_front inhale and exhale
cylhtiqmitc_5-8-rgb_front inhale and exhale
cylhtiqmitc_6-8-rgb_front now we are going to reverse
cylhtiqmitc_7-8-rgb_front inhale lower exhale up and over
cylhtiqmitc_8-8-rgb_front inhale lower exhale up and over
cylhtiqmitc_9-8-rgb_front now i do have a slight bend in my elbow designed to be more of a micro bend than an actual bend because we really do not ever want to lock any of our joints whether it is the knees or the elbows
cz1cqs0axfm_0-5-rgb_front this type of collar is called a convertible collar or an open collar
cz1cqs0axfm_1-5-rgb_front it is similar to the trench coat collar in that it has the two pieces on each side sewn together
cz1cqs0axfm_2-5-rgb_front the convertible part of it comes from the fact that this is like the basically a convertible collar just is referencing the basic collar and the open term if you want to call it convertible call it convertible
cz1cqs0axfm_3-5-rgb_front if you want to call it open call it open
cz1cqs0axfm_4-5-rgb_front it is going to lie further out from the neck than the regular collar regular convertible collar is
cz1cqs0axfm_5-5-rgb_front this also in this version i have shown it with the more feminine type buttonholes that have vertical ones as opposed to horizontal
cz1cqs0axfm_6-5-rgb_front that just gives it another look and the openness of the collar allows for the neck bones the clavicle to be shown which in fashion design is going to create a more elegant look because that symbolizes more of a put together elegant frame just in general
czxicdeaway_0-8-rgb_front clancy rose all right so now we are going to move on to mixing your breve unless you already have just a quart you already have some half and half ready and then steaming the milk for the double breve latte
czxicdeaway_1-8-rgb_front here today i have just a gallon of whole milk and a sounds like thing of heavy whipping cream
czxicdeaway_10-8-rgb_front then you are going to drop down the pitcher so that the tip of the steam wand is just right at or right above the surface of the milk
czxicdeaway_11-8-rgb_front you are going to hear air start to being introduced into the milk and what you are doing is creating foam at that point
czxicdeaway_12-8-rgb_front and with breve since it contains more fat we are going to want to stretch it for longer
czxicdeaway_13-8-rgb_front so for breve latte i am going to be stretching for about seven or eight seconds and then i am going to push this pitcher back up and get it at the right angle again so that it is spinning around inside the pitcher again and keep that up until it is at the temperature that i want the milk
czxicdeaway_2-8-rgb_front so i am going to mix that just equal portions half whole milk and half heavy whipping cream which is going to make half and half or breve
czxicdeaway_3-8-rgb_front and i am going to fill that up in the pitcher
czxicdeaway_4-8-rgb_front i am using a cup so i am going to fill up the milk to the pitcher to about this ridge
czxicdeaway_5-8-rgb_front this is how much milk you should use
czxicdeaway_6-8-rgb_front i am going to begin the steaming process
czxicdeaway_7-8-rgb_front what i do is i do the steaming in three motions
czxicdeaway_8-8-rgb_front the first is positioning the pitcher around the steam wand in such a an angle to where when you turn the steam wand on the milk starts swirling around in a circle inside the steaming pitcher
czxicdeaway_9-8-rgb_front i do that until the milk temperature kind of matches the temperature of my hand it is about degrees and you just kind of feel this warm break in the milk
d-2jxczeurm_0-4-rgb_front your wheels picking out the proper skateboard wheels is very important
d-2jxczeurm_1-4-rgb_front what you are going to want to do is you are going to want to pick out the right hardness and the right size for your skating
d-2jxczeurm_10-4-rgb_front and then you have a black wheel here the black wheel is sometimes a little softer so you will notice that it feels a little softer to the rolling on the street
d-2jxczeurm_11-4-rgb_front and then you actually have super soft kryptonic wheels now these are just pretty much for cruising or sometimes for a filmer to set up a board to roll along with the skateboarder while he is skating
d-2jxczeurm_12-4-rgb_front now the hardness of the wheel is written somewhere on the side of the wheel or should be somewhere found
d-2jxczeurm_13-4-rgb_front now these soft wheels are a is which tell you that they are pretty soft
d-2jxczeurm_14-4-rgb_front usually wheels will run somewhere between a ninety six and a one hundred and one
d-2jxczeurm_15-4-rgb_front now these rictas here are probably somewhere around a one hundred or a one hundred and one hardness which is the usual street wheel
d-2jxczeurm_16-4-rgb_front now they are usually smaller compact and they are a little bit harder
d-2jxczeurm_17-4-rgb_front and the reason that they are a little bit harder is so that when you end up sliding across surfaces they do not end up flat spotting
d-2jxczeurm_18-4-rgb_front and rictas are very good they usually do not flat spot at all
d-2jxczeurm_19-4-rgb_front a softer wheel if it slides across a surface does not turn because it is not as hard
d-2jxczeurm_2-4-rgb_front you are going to notice that when it comes to having smaller wheels that you are a little closer to the ground
d-2jxczeurm_20-4-rgb_front so it stops and it slides in one spot while your sliding and this causes a flat spot
d-2jxczeurm_21-4-rgb_front and it does not take very much of a flat spot on a skateboard wheel to make it a load ride and roll down the street and go da da da da because of the flat spot
d-2jxczeurm_22-4-rgb_front now the way to avoid this is usually riding a harder wheel if you intend on doing some kinds of slides
d-2jxczeurm_23-4-rgb_front and this is how you pick out the proper skateboard wheel
d-2jxczeurm_3-4-rgb_front so the distance between the bottom of the wheel and the truck is very small and so it is a lot lower
d-2jxczeurm_4-4-rgb_front and the bigger the wheel that you get you will notice that you will be a little higher off the ground
d-2jxczeurm_5-4-rgb_front now what this will do is in picking a wheel size will not only change the speed that you are traveling so the bigger wheel will go a little faster than the smaller wheel but also when you are doing a trick and you are pushing down on the tail a larger wheel will require you to go a lot steeper before the tail actually hits the ground
d-2jxczeurm_6-4-rgb_front so when you are picking out wheels or when your choosing a wheel size it is best to stick with a certain size because your board will feel familiar to you when you hit the tail on the ground
d-2jxczeurm_7-4-rgb_front now that is one reason that people pick a certain kind of size wheel and that is for tricks and being lower to the ground and being able to have that control of the pop
d-2jxczeurm_8-4-rgb_front the other reason picking wheels is for the ride that you get and how it feels while you are cruising
d-2jxczeurm_9-4-rgb_front now there is a lot of different wheels that you can get and here we have a white wheel that is pretty normal ricta is that feel like a normal street wheel and they are kind of narrow
d0g_itf8exy_0-5-rgb_front first i am going to show you what to do with our saturated book
d0g_itf8exy_1-5-rgb_front as i mentioned before how we deal with each book follows from saturated to least saturated going in a very prescribed set of steps
d0g_itf8exy_2-5-rgb_front the important thing to remember for the saturated book is that you want to keep it up on end while you are letting it dry
d0g_itf8exy_3-5-rgb_front this is to allow the maximum amount of air flow to the pages
d0g_itf8exy_4-5-rgb_front you can see that the pages are too wet in order to separate even so you want to be able to get as much air flowing around here through the top as possible
d0g_itf8exy_5-5-rgb_front if your book is so wet that it does not want to stand up on end then go ahead and use book holders bookends in order to keep it upright
d0g_itf8exy_6-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that the bookends that you use do not have anything on the edge that is going to get wet and rub off on the book or stick to the book and damage it even more
d0g_itf8exy_7-5-rgb_front it is important for you to have something absorbent underneath the book
d0g_itf8exy_8-5-rgb_front you want to have paper towels or some type of absorbent cloth
d0g_itf8exy_9-5-rgb_front it is important because it is going to get wet and you are going to want to keep an eye on your book and check it at least every half hour in order to change the material underneath it and to flip the book around
d0t7ho08q3o_0-2-rgb_front let is drill the footwork for the egyptian walk
d0t7ho08q3o_1-2-rgb_front so we are going to start
d0t7ho08q3o_10-2-rgb_front step touch
d0t7ho08q3o_11-2-rgb_front step together
d0t7ho08q3o_12-2-rgb_front forward
d0t7ho08q3o_13-2-rgb_front step together
d0t7ho08q3o_14-2-rgb_front keep the knees bent belly button pulled in
d0t7ho08q3o_15-2-rgb_front step together
d0t7ho08q3o_16-2-rgb_front good
d0t7ho08q3o_17-2-rgb_front still going forward
d0t7ho08q3o_18-2-rgb_front and step together
d0t7ho08q3o_19-2-rgb_front step together
d0t7ho08q3o_2-2-rgb_front i am going to turn my back towards you
d0t7ho08q3o_20-2-rgb_front so try to visualize that you are walking across a pond on lily pads and you do not want to get your feet wet
d0t7ho08q3o_21-2-rgb_front so the foot is not out here the feet are always step and then together
d0t7ho08q3o_22-2-rgb_front step together step together
d0t7ho08q3o_23-2-rgb_front as you step do not let your ankle fall out
d0t7ho08q3o_24-2-rgb_front keep the weight on that toe keep that ankle pulled in nice and strong
d0t7ho08q3o_25-2-rgb_front good
d0t7ho08q3o_26-2-rgb_front step together
d0t7ho08q3o_27-2-rgb_front even if you are taking tiny steps make sure those toes come together
d0t7ho08q3o_3-2-rgb_front we are going to start with our weight on the left foot
d0t7ho08q3o_4-2-rgb_front we are going to step keep the arms out away from the body
d0t7ho08q3o_5-2-rgb_front keep the knees bent belly button pulled in chest lifted shoulder blades down and back
d0t7ho08q3o_6-2-rgb_front good we are going to step forward on the right foot and bring the left foot to meet it here
d0t7ho08q3o_7-2-rgb_front step and touch
d0t7ho08q3o_8-2-rgb_front step and touch
d0t7ho08q3o_9-2-rgb_front take it back step touch
d1kcyg3zgdm_0-8-rgb_front okay the next process you have is to decide if you need gray coverage if you actually have gray hair showing and you need to cover gray
d1kcyg3zgdm_1-8-rgb_front that is the major reason why people want to color their hair
d1kcyg3zgdm_10-8-rgb_front some people have less gray than others
d1kcyg3zgdm_11-8-rgb_front have you colored your hair previously or not
d1kcyg3zgdm_12-8-rgb_front again this is another product
d1kcyg3zgdm_13-8-rgb_front it says gray coverage protects even fragile hair
d1kcyg3zgdm_14-8-rgb_front so if you have fine hair make sure you are buying something for fragile fine hair
d1kcyg3zgdm_15-8-rgb_front if you do not have gray i mean if you have gray here you probably do not want to use a color because it is not going to cover your gray hair
d1kcyg3zgdm_16-8-rgb_front it is going to wash out and just give you some strange orange and pink highlights
d1kcyg3zgdm_17-8-rgb_front so when covering gray make sure you are looking for something that has gray coverage on the box and in the instructions
d1kcyg3zgdm_2-8-rgb_front you have to do your homework again on this because all colors are not created equal
d1kcyg3zgdm_3-8-rgb_front you are looking for gray coverage on the box that you purchase
d1kcyg3zgdm_4-8-rgb_front so it says on here gray coverage
d1kcyg3zgdm_5-8-rgb_front that is the process you are looking for
d1kcyg3zgdm_6-8-rgb_front this is a great root product because that is exactly what it is for to touch up the roots and touch up the gray
d1kcyg3zgdm_7-8-rgb_front make sure you read your instructions because it is going to tell you in the instructions
d1kcyg3zgdm_8-8-rgb_front read them fully before you get started
d1kcyg3zgdm_9-8-rgb_front it is going to tell you how long to process based on how gray your hair is
d1ofziwbw_0_0-8-rgb_front you can teach your dog to use a litter box
d1ofziwbw_0_1-8-rgb_front there are many different solutions out there that have an attractant that will draw your dog to the litter in the box and are more acceptable for dog use than for cat use
d1ofziwbw_0_10-8-rgb_front also some dogs will not be comfortable going to the bathroom on concrete or gravel and so they might need an alternative to that
d1ofziwbw_0_11-8-rgb_front there might also be a situation where you have a small dog and you are gone for a long period of time or you are going to be going away and somebody is only going to be coming to check on your dog once a day which may not be recommended
d1ofziwbw_0_12-8-rgb_front i would check with your landlord and make sure that these are all appropriate things for your building
d1ofziwbw_0_13-8-rgb_front but that might be another reason why you would choose to use a litter box for your dog
d1ofziwbw_0_2-8-rgb_front so look go out and look for a dog litter box in particular
d1ofziwbw_0_3-8-rgb_front they are also a little bit larger and have an easier entrance for them to make the dog more comfortable
d1ofziwbw_0_4-8-rgb_front if your dog is already trained to pee pads or newspaper you can start by putting pieces of those things in the box to draw the dog to go in the same location
d1ofziwbw_0_5-8-rgb_front dogs tend to like to use the same spot where they have gone before
d1ofziwbw_0_6-8-rgb_front the same general area
d1ofziwbw_0_7-8-rgb_front you can also bring in some of their feces from outside and put it in the litter box again to draw them to that and then just work slowly
d1ofziwbw_0_8-8-rgb_front you might need to confine your dog until you think that they need to go to the bathroom and then only give them access to that litter box so that hopefully that is where they will choose to go
d1ofziwbw_0_9-8-rgb_front you might choose to use a dog litter box if you live in a high rise or an urban area where it is hard to get your dog outside to go to the bathroom
d2lgxrx72no_0-5-rgb_front to your look
d2lgxrx72no_1-5-rgb_front they can look good with hair hidden behind or with short hair dangling down the neck
d2lgxrx72no_2-5-rgb_front a shorter stud earring is less obvious and more subtle than a dangling chandler earring
d2lgxrx72no_3-5-rgb_front but again if you re a smaller person large dangling earrings can be more overwhelming than and a smaller stud earring may be more appropriate for your size
d2lgxrx72no_4-5-rgb_front and then there is the always impeccable mid length earring
d2lgxrx72no_5-5-rgb_front anybody can wear this no matter how big they are
d2noipfxjye_0-5-rgb_front so the warranty is set by the manufacturer
d2noipfxjye_1-5-rgb_front the warranties we have two different warranties they have two different warranties
d2noipfxjye_10-5-rgb_front the companies will take care of your product of your unit if you use it the right way
d2noipfxjye_11-5-rgb_front if you play with it they are not going to take care of it you will not have it under warranty
d2noipfxjye_12-5-rgb_front they have an extended warranty and it is actually a great piece to have because again they have an extended warranty that you can buy which is an additional warranty on top of the manufacturer
d2noipfxjye_13-5-rgb_front not just for the mechanism for the sofa but it does the whole couch against rips tears and burns
d2noipfxjye_14-5-rgb_front but it is a great piece because it extends that warranty out there and makes you when you spend that money
d2noipfxjye_15-5-rgb_front it makes you as an investment that you are going to have a five or ten year warranty for the product you are going to buy it is going to last
d2noipfxjye_16-5-rgb_front it is going to last a lot longer than going back and buying something in two years because you did not have an extended warranty
d2noipfxjye_2-5-rgb_front the manufacturer sets up the warranty through the normal wear and tear or the normal defects
d2noipfxjye_3-5-rgb_front as you can see this unit here i am giving you this as an example
d2noipfxjye_4-5-rgb_front this is a reclining unit
d2noipfxjye_5-5-rgb_front now this reclining unit has a lever has a switch right here
d2noipfxjye_6-5-rgb_front with this switch that you pull out right now it will bring the piece up
d2noipfxjye_7-5-rgb_front if you go ahead and take care of this they give you a lifetime warranty which is normal on any of these couches
d2noipfxjye_8-5-rgb_front the only way that they can have damages or they can have damages from the kids or adults are playing with it and just fooling around with the switch
d2noipfxjye_9-5-rgb_front but it is very easy
d323p3sltr4_0-5-rgb_front hi i am jk dooley and we are talking today about giclee reproductions and when you choose paper unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it there is a perception of quality just based on the product that you choose
d323p3sltr4_1-5-rgb_front some people think that paper as compared to canvas means it is an inferior product and that is not true but that is perception
d323p3sltr4_2-5-rgb_front so one of the ways i kind of fight that is when i choose a paper to print on i make sure that i choose a quality paper that has some weight to it as opposed to this particular paper that is pretty light and actually feels kind of like poster paper
d323p3sltr4_3_4-5-rgb_front so people go by their sense of touch a lot when it comes to this kind of stuff so if you choose a heavier weight paper that gives them a perception of something of a little more value and then something just as subtle as this paper has been cut as you can see with a blade and this paper i hand tear the edges on this paper so you get an interesting edge there
d323p3sltr4_5-5-rgb_front it is a nice deckled edge and people equate that with a higher quality product
d323p3sltr4_6-5-rgb_front so that is a really good way to work with paper and make sure people feel that they are getting a good quality product which they are
d4ocstbgjeu_0-8-rgb_front so today we are going to talk about the tools that you will need for wire jewelry making
d4ocstbgjeu_1-8-rgb_front you will start with a pair of round nose pliers
d4ocstbgjeu_10-8-rgb_front these are a little hard to find but if you can find them i suggest it highly
d4ocstbgjeu_11-8-rgb_front your flat nose pliers you are going to use to flatten the wire these you also have an option to wrap the wire
d4ocstbgjeu_12-8-rgb_front wire comes in varying sizes gauges and types so we will go into that a little later
d4ocstbgjeu_13-8-rgb_front your beads are basically by your choice
d4ocstbgjeu_14-8-rgb_front whatever beads kind of call to you
d4ocstbgjeu_15-8-rgb_front and then a pair of wire cutters you want to get the most the sharpest and best quality wire cutters as possible
d4ocstbgjeu_16-8-rgb_front finally your towel is going to keep from your beads flying all over the place and your basic needs for wire making jewelry
d4ocstbgjeu_2-8-rgb_front you will need a pair of flat nose pliers
d4ocstbgjeu_3-8-rgb_front you will also of course need wire
d4ocstbgjeu_4-8-rgb_front a towel so your beads fly away
d4ocstbgjeu_5-8-rgb_front beads or findings and wire cutters
d4ocstbgjeu_6-8-rgb_front your round nose pliers are essential
d4ocstbgjeu_7-8-rgb_front what you are going to need to work with the wire to bend the wire
d4ocstbgjeu_8-8-rgb_front also these are really cool because you can they have got flat nose and round so it is kind of an all in one pair of pliers
d4ocstbgjeu_9-8-rgb_front you can actually cut the wire with these
d76exyvd-sy_1-8-rgb_front today i am going to teach you how to slide
d76exyvd-sy_2-8-rgb_front in this segment we are going to teach you a technique called the slide by
d76exyvd-sy_3-8-rgb_front a slide by the only difference is when we normally slide to the base with your foot making contact to the base you want to slide away from the base and reaching with your arm
d76exyvd-sy_4-8-rgb_front now a regular slide by like we demonstrated is a simple slide just with your foot going directly to the base
d76exyvd-sy_5-8-rgb_front a slide by is slightly different
d76exyvd-sy_6-8-rgb_front we are sliding the exact same way the technique does not change but the slide is now away from the base taking the momentum up to the base with your left arm and reaching it with your left hand
d76exyvd-sy_7-8-rgb_front this is only done to where if you are able to avoid a tag and making the play reach for you as oppose to reaching for your ankle for a simple out
d9otauv9ajy_0-8-rgb_front vodka extremely versatile liquor but what is the best drink to have it with
d9otauv9ajy_1-8-rgb_front hi my name is jeff klein and i am a vodka connoisseur and bartender here at beak is old florida st petersburg
d9otauv9ajy_10-8-rgb_front mixes up with a nice little off color to it let is you know that olive juice is in there put a couple olives on a sword and ready to serve
d9otauv9ajy_11-8-rgb_front it is a classic never go wrong
d9otauv9ajy_12-8-rgb_front olive juice compliments the vodka perfectly and almost anybody will love it
d9otauv9ajy_13-8-rgb_front so that is your best tasting vodka drink
d9otauv9ajy_14-8-rgb_front my name is jeff klein and i am vodka connoisseur and bartender here at beak is old florida st pete
d9otauv9ajy_2-8-rgb_front and i am going to tell you what is the best tasting vodka drink
d9otauv9ajy_3-8-rgb_front now i think you should stick with the classics
d9otauv9ajy_4-8-rgb_front and that is a martini
d9otauv9ajy_5-8-rgb_front but nothing compliments a vodka martini better than olive juice
d9otauv9ajy_6-8-rgb_front so the best tasting vodka drink would be a dirty martini
d9otauv9ajy_7-8-rgb_front now the trick is you do not want to put in too much olive juice cause if you wanted that you would just be drinking the olive juice
d9otauv9ajy_8-8-rgb_front second you get yourself a good vodka over ice a good shake to it and a martini glass
d9otauv9ajy_9-8-rgb_front all fairly simple so far
d9fi-2txdwo_0-8-rgb_front talk a little bit about throw ropes
d9fi-2txdwo_1-8-rgb_front we have a variety of different size throw ropes this is a small throw rope here has about a forty foot rope pretty thin rope here clips open you can see that the ropes inside here
d9fi-2txdwo_2-8-rgb_front we have a throw rope attached to your waist so you know exactly where it is at all times
d9fi-2txdwo_3-8-rgb_front this again sort of a shortish rope around forty feet good for throwing ropes for short swims people a short distance away and then this is more of a typical rafting throw rope
d9fi-2txdwo_4-8-rgb_front about a foot rope essentially the same design
d9fi-2txdwo_5-8-rgb_front when this comes new to you neatly wrapped inside the bag you need to take it out and throw it once to get all that neatness out of it and then when you repack this rope
d9fi-2txdwo_6-8-rgb_front you pack it in a random way just stuffing the rope inside the bag and that way it enables it to enables you to throw the rope and the rope in the bag just feeds themselves out nicely which is great
d9gcaliab4c_0-11-rgb_front so i have a model here
d9gcaliab4c_1-11-rgb_front and what i want to show you all is that she has a base color that was applied
d9gcaliab4c_10-11-rgb_front and then you go back in like our model has with a highlight lowlight it really is a good blending situation for the gray
d9gcaliab4c_11-11-rgb_front and it is really color is all what you can compare it to what it lays against
d9gcaliab4c_12-11-rgb_front and because you have a mixture and a dimensional look you are not focusing on the gray
d9gcaliab4c_13-11-rgb_front you are focusing on the other colors
d9gcaliab4c_14-11-rgb_front and not as wide
d9gcaliab4c_15-11-rgb_front you should blend your gray with highlights and lowlights and a base color
d9gcaliab4c_2-11-rgb_front and it is a little bit darker
d9gcaliab4c_3-11-rgb_front and she also has a highlight in there
d9gcaliab4c_4-11-rgb_front and you can get a lot of different placements to blend gray
d9gcaliab4c_5-11-rgb_front this placement is a little bit more of a medium chunkier placement
d9gcaliab4c_6-11-rgb_front so there is areas between the highlight versus the low light
d9gcaliab4c_7-11-rgb_front but what happens with the gray is gray grows out
d9gcaliab4c_8-11-rgb_front it is normally just on the root or the base of the hair
d9gcaliab4c_9-11-rgb_front so what tends to happen when you get the based covered the base actually covered with color
d9kxrudrku8_0-5-rgb_front i am ivan madar
d9kxrudrku8_10-5-rgb_front skiing is done from your waste down
d9kxrudrku8_11-5-rgb_front the upper body and the arms are really used for balance and for counteracting some of the forces that come in advanced skiing when you have to deal with a lot of speed
d9kxrudrku8_12-5-rgb_front but the upper body is not involved in rotations not these movements in skiing
d9kxrudrku8_13-5-rgb_front in skiing the movements go up and down or up and forward
d9kxrudrku8_14-5-rgb_front now we learned all the basic principles and biomechanics and your basic stance and balance now let is put it to use
d9kxrudrku8_15-5-rgb_front let is put on some gear put on some boots get skis get poles put on some hats and gloves and let is go out on the snow
d9kxrudrku8_2-5-rgb_front another example of why you need to flex your knees which is a phrase that is used all the time in skiing but there is a lot of truth in if you do not flex your knees you will not be able to accomplish most of the rotary movement and most of the weight transfer movement
d9kxrudrku8_3-5-rgb_front i will give you an example straighten out your knees and now try to jump
d9kxrudrku8_4-5-rgb_front it is very difficult you have no control
d9kxrudrku8_5-5-rgb_front now flex your knees and jump
d9kxrudrku8_6-5-rgb_front obviously it is much easier
d9kxrudrku8_7-5-rgb_front so the knees throughout skiing work as shock absorbers through almost any movement and will help you whenever you have a skill you are going to learn on the snow
d9kxrudrku8_8-5-rgb_front so these are the basic biomechanical principles that are applied throughout the skiing progression and it is very good to do these skills on a dry land before you go try it
d9kxrudrku8_9-5-rgb_front try to go
dbdddxx-cja_0-8-rgb_front as i said before bags were put into the game were added to the game in the late is because this feature was to help to ratchet down i guess you could ratchet up too that is an interesting word
dbdddxx-cja_1-8-rgb_front the use of the bidding by the old classic spaders who decided that well maybe the partners had to bid a minimum of two
dbdddxx-cja_10-8-rgb_front in spades the bag feature was added to add a dimension to the game where bagging does become a key part of the game
dbdddxx-cja_11-8-rgb_front the great players really know how to utilize the bagging strategy and the idea is to try to force the opponents into the penalty situation for underbidding the hands
dbdddxx-cja_12-8-rgb_front there is a fine line between over bidding and under bidding and it is called the eleven bid
dbdddxx-cja_13-8-rgb_front you know that when the hand is bid at eleven you have to make a decision are you going to go for the set or are you going to go for the bags
dbdddxx-cja_14-8-rgb_front it is tough to beat a trick i mean if you have a suit that looks like queen eight and a really small one six
dbdddxx-cja_15-8-rgb_front can you really bid that for a trick
dbdddxx-cja_16-8-rgb_front well if it was spades probably
dbdddxx-cja_17-8-rgb_front if it was hearts and so forth but there is often times where you would be forced to take a trick from that hand
dbdddxx-cja_18-8-rgb_front and a lot of the good players what they do is that if they are forced to take this queen earlier then they say okay i took a trick i was not counting on and maybe if i can take another one that i am not counting on and there is an eleven bid on the table perhaps i can go for a set
dbdddxx-cja_19-8-rgb_front so again keep in mind that bagging is part of the game and the accumulation of over tricks will result in penalties but it is like losing points
dbdddxx-cja_2-8-rgb_front so you get these eight and nine bids and who cares if you make over tricks
dbdddxx-cja_20-8-rgb_front but then again if you over bid then you wind up getting into set situations
dbdddxx-cja_21-8-rgb_front when we look at the advance side of this particular topic we will see the impact on bags and how the strategy of bagging really takes a big role in the end game of spades
dbdddxx-cja_22-8-rgb_front again conservative but not too conservative
dbdddxx-cja_23-8-rgb_front bid the tricks that you think you are going to take without going over the limit
dbdddxx-cja_3-8-rgb_front in other words you did not have to bid accurately
dbdddxx-cja_4-8-rgb_front some variations in the game even allowed people to bid three and if they made five they got credit for five
dbdddxx-cja_5-8-rgb_front so if that is the case then why would you bid five you just could bid three you could bid one
dbdddxx-cja_6-8-rgb_front you could be much like the whisk group that has a game that is a lot of fun
dbdddxx-cja_7-8-rgb_front they play with jokers they play with the kitty
dbdddxx-cja_8-8-rgb_front it is just a really wild west game and if you bid four then you make thirteen and you get what is called a boston and is not that just great
dbdddxx-cja_9-8-rgb_front then you could bid null trump and so forth
dbjpkwp0eri_0-8-rgb_front now i am going to show you how to do a triple buffalo
dbjpkwp0eri_1-8-rgb_front lift one foot up strike the flat part of the toe tap on the floor pull the flat part of the toe tap back land on the ball of the foot
dbjpkwp0eri_10-8-rgb_front the triple buffalo can be a very impressive way to change formations in your choreography
dbjpkwp0eri_11-8-rgb_front lift one foot shuffle step shuffle switch
dbjpkwp0eri_12-8-rgb_front shuffle step shuffle switch
dbjpkwp0eri_13-8-rgb_front shuffle step shuffle switch
dbjpkwp0eri_14-8-rgb_front now i will show you how to travel a little bit faster
dbjpkwp0eri_15-8-rgb_front now i will show you the rear view traveling
dbjpkwp0eri_16-8-rgb_front shuffle step shuffle hop
dbjpkwp0eri_2-8-rgb_front then you want to lift up the opposing foot strike the flat part of that toe tap forward pull the flat part of the tap back hop and switch feet remembering to land on the ball of your foot
dbjpkwp0eri_3-8-rgb_front lift the right foot strike the flat part of the tap forward pull the flat part of the tap back land on the ball of the foot strike the flat part of the opposing foot forward pull the tap back hop and switch feet
dbjpkwp0eri_4-8-rgb_front shuffle step shuffle switch
dbjpkwp0eri_5-8-rgb_front now i am going to show you the side view of the triple buffalo
dbjpkwp0eri_6-8-rgb_front lift one foot front back step front back switch
dbjpkwp0eri_7-8-rgb_front now i am going to show you the rear view of the triple buffalo
dbjpkwp0eri_8-8-rgb_front shuffle step shuffle switch
dbjpkwp0eri_9-8-rgb_front now i am going to show you how to travel with the triple buffalo
dbkj9j-g9pu_0-8-rgb_front let is talk about the magnified view in image playback
dbkj9j-g9pu_1-8-rgb_front in order to activate image playback you are going to need to press the button on the furthest side of your camera at the very bottom left corner there is a blue triangle
dbkj9j-g9pu_10-8-rgb_front what i can do is use this control just above the quick control dial a little bit to the right of the lcd screen and it kind of acts like a joystick and what i can do is use that to navigate around in my image by pressing in really any direction and i can scroll around to look at different parts of my image
dbkj9j-g9pu_11-8-rgb_front i can zoom out and then scroll over to the left
dbkj9j-g9pu_12-8-rgb_front i can scroll down or diagonally but what i am going to do is go ahead and zoom back out and i was in there pretty close
dbkj9j-g9pu_13-8-rgb_front now i am back to index view
dbkj9j-g9pu_14-8-rgb_front what i can do is go ahead and select another image and then and zoom in and check out another image
dbkj9j-g9pu_15-8-rgb_front it is a good way to check your exposure settings and look at some of the detail on your image
dbkj9j-g9pu_16-8-rgb_front it is another thing you can do is get a magnifying glass to place over the top of your lcd screen and look at some of the detail you are getting on your images
dbkj9j-g9pu_2-8-rgb_front go ahead and press that button to activate playback mode and what you are going to do is scroll through with your quick control dial and select an image
dbkj9j-g9pu_3-8-rgb_front i am going to select that one by pressing set actually to it is selected what i am going to do is zoom in there with the zoom button that looks like a magnifying glass with a plus sign in the middle
dbkj9j-g9pu_4-8-rgb_front up here on the top right side of the camera i am going to go ahead and press that now i am at full size view and what i want to do is zoom in a little bit further to get closer to see how my how my focus was and see some of the detail on this image
dbkj9j-g9pu_5-8-rgb_front now i am about as close as i am going to get
dbkj9j-g9pu_6-8-rgb_front that is as close as i can zoom in
dbkj9j-g9pu_7-8-rgb_front that gives me a pretty good idea of the image quality and the sharpness on some of those more contrasted areas of the shot and obviously right now this little indicator in the bottom of the screen is kind of grayed out and there is a white square inside there
dbkj9j-g9pu_8-8-rgb_front that white square is the image is the area of the image that i am zoomed in to
dbkj9j-g9pu_9-8-rgb_front right now i am exactly in the center of the image
dbweyk9ilmg_0-3-rgb_front there is a glass medium considered a glazing as well it is just a plain piece of glass
dbweyk9ilmg_1-3-rgb_front there is not rule the difference between this glass and the glass in your window in your house
dbweyk9ilmg_2-3-rgb_front it is very clear it gives you a reflection the reflection is really good because it is reflecting the light back to you rather than absorbing it through the glass and into your picture
dbweyk9ilmg_3-3-rgb_front it is one of the ones i prefer it gives you a crisp clear picture every time and that is it is clean
dc6gcj9qykw_0-8-rgb_front about this time we can also start teaching nonsense words
dc6gcj9qykw_1-8-rgb_front nonsense words are words that are not real we do not use them but they illustrate the same rule that we are working on
dc6gcj9qykw_2-8-rgb_front so right now we are working on the simple short vowel sounds and learning consonant sounds so a nonsense word in this category would be like fid fid and remember to tell your child these are not real words and if you sometimes i mix nonsense words in with real words and i say that is not a real word
dc6gcj9qykw_3-8-rgb_front what this does is it teaches the child the pure act of sounding out without trying to guess what the word is
dc6gcj9qykw_4-8-rgb_front after a while children will look at p i and just try to guess that you are writing pin or you are writing pig and they will not even look at the last letter and they will get it wrong
dc6gcj9qykw_5-8-rgb_front to keep your child from trying to jump ahead we have these nonsense words so we fill it up with fid and din or any word you can think of that is not a real word fill it up with those words and have them practice these words also as they are practicing the real words
dc6gcj9qykw_6-8-rgb_front this will work for any new rule as we go into larger words with blends and silent e is and different vowel combinations
dc6gcj9qykw_7-8-rgb_front you can still use that rule and throw in a word that is not a real word to teach them to sound out purely
dd8ux-rdam4_0-8-rgb_front in my hand this is a steel reel patterson with a plastic lock on it
dd8ux-rdam4_1-8-rgb_front you can see there is a little tiny clip in there
dd8ux-rdam4_10-8-rgb_front when i hear that sound again the film is going on and i get it on my reel and i am good to go
dd8ux-rdam4_2-8-rgb_front some people feel these reels are a little bit easier to use and in a way i think they are
dd8ux-rdam4_3-8-rgb_front i want to hold the reel between my hand like this film between my thumb and my finger and this point i want to have facing out
dd8ux-rdam4_4-8-rgb_front a very important part of using this type of reel is this point right here
dd8ux-rdam4_5-8-rgb_front i am going to take the film and with my thumb i am just going to slide it in little bit difficult but not really
dd8ux-rdam4_6-8-rgb_front once that film is in i know that i am at a place where i can start to roll
dd8ux-rdam4_7-8-rgb_front and again i am going to hold the film between my thumb and my finger and i just start to take up
dd8ux-rdam4_8-8-rgb_front this is almost rolling film is almost more in your wrist
dd8ux-rdam4_9-8-rgb_front it is really it is almost so easy it makes it difficult
ddsijftolbe_1-8-rgb_front let me show you the ingredients for the stuffed cabbaged we are going to be using lbs of ground beef to heads of cabbage cups of rice eggs onion cup of ketchup teaspoon of salt teaspoon of black pepper and clove of garlic
ddsijftolbe_2-8-rgb_front here is a little tip on making cabbage rolls really easy normally recipes will call for the cabbage to be steamed in order to make the leaves soft enough to roll the cabbage rolls
ddsijftolbe_3-8-rgb_front what i like to do is as soon as i buy the cabbage i will core it out and place it in the freezer now when you take them out of the freezer and they thaw out the leaves are soft as you steamed the cabbage and very easy to roll the cabbage rolls
ddsijftolbe_4-8-rgb_front this is worth very doing and makes it very much easier
ddbxcfzixh4_0-8-rgb_front this type of neck opening is a button down collar
ddbxcfzixh4_1-8-rgb_front this is just like on a regular button down the front oxford shirt that has cuffs boring old plain shirt that a man would wear with a tie
ddbxcfzixh4_10-8-rgb_front so we want to draw that and then go down to wherever the collar is going to end
ddbxcfzixh4_11-8-rgb_front and then draw our top button and our button placket
ddbxcfzixh4_12-8-rgb_front and then draw your buttons to make it an actual button down collar
ddbxcfzixh4_2-8-rgb_front the button down collar means that it has buttons on the collar very literally
ddbxcfzixh4_3-8-rgb_front this would be for typically simply obviously it is a man and he is wearing a tie
ddbxcfzixh4_4-8-rgb_front usually they are going to have the buttons
ddbxcfzixh4_5-8-rgb_front that is what that is for
ddbxcfzixh4_6-8-rgb_front but for women they are it could be a decoration
ddbxcfzixh4_7-8-rgb_front you could wear a tie with it whatever you want to do
ddbxcfzixh4_8-8-rgb_front whatever whatever you want to draw just draw
ddbxcfzixh4_9-8-rgb_front make sure again that you show that it is a collar that it is going around the entire neck not just two little squares coming out from the shoulders
de8ykwrpvya_0-5-rgb_front o k
de8ykwrpvya_1-5-rgb_front now on this time imagine that your opponent is not that strong of a server you are turning your second serve or you are you have really you have got a pretty good serve return
de8ykwrpvya_10-5-rgb_front oh that ball had some muster on it
de8ykwrpvya_11-5-rgb_front so as you can see you just do this drill and you are going to get a pretty good return and your opponent knows that if you can return their serve their in a lot their in a very tough tough hole because then they do not have any weapons
de8ykwrpvya_12-5-rgb_front so if you can return a serve it really makes you that much more of a deadly player because a serve is usually a main weapon for a lot of players and if you can return it pretty effortlessly it makes holding your serve that much easier
de8ykwrpvya_2-5-rgb_front so we are going to do the topspin forehand serve return now
de8ykwrpvya_3-5-rgb_front so ken is going to demonstrate this but i am going to serve to him
de8ykwrpvya_4-5-rgb_front so what i want you to think about is here imagine i am returning serve to my forehand so i have the racket in my forehand position forehand grip and i turn now because it is a serve there is a lot of pace on it
de8ykwrpvya_5-5-rgb_front i do not need to take this huge turn but i just turn and then i want to hit the ball like that
de8ykwrpvya_6-5-rgb_front so i am trying to maybe win the point with this return or just hit a nice force tough return which puts them in a weak position so then i can bring the point maybe on the next shot or the shot after
de8ykwrpvya_7-5-rgb_front so ken is going to demonstrate forehand topspin serve return
de8ykwrpvya_8-5-rgb_front and it is a great shot to work on and you can win a lot of points if you get a good return
de8ykwrpvya_9-5-rgb_front good try it again
dedhbxyidwy_0-3-rgb_front david clemen hi
dedhbxyidwy_2-3-rgb_front and today we are going to do an abstract painting
dedhbxyidwy_3-3-rgb_front hi
dedhbxyidwy_4-3-rgb_front welcome back
dedhbxyidwy_5-3-rgb_front today we are going to do an abstract painting and it took me a long time to figure out what an abstract painting was but i have kinda found through different experiments with paintings and so forth that it is really an expression that you can do pretty much with any paint and color
dedhbxyidwy_6-3-rgb_front it is not so much about form it is really about just expressing yourself with colors and shapes and things like that
dedhbxyidwy_7-3-rgb_front this is an example of one of my abstract paintings
dedhbxyidwy_8-3-rgb_front i did this a few years ago when i first moved to north carolina and i guess the colors kinda represent the ocean because we are near the ocean here and you know
dedhbxyidwy_9-3-rgb_front so basically what i am going to show you today is a couple of the different tools that you can use to make a beautiful abstract painting that would go nicely in your home
defrl-3iyce_0-5-rgb_front the last thing that we are going to do to complete this look is we are going to use a little bit of gloss
defrl-3iyce_1-5-rgb_front i am going to use this shade right here
defrl-3iyce_10-5-rgb_front it makes the lips look a little bit poutier
defrl-3iyce_11-5-rgb_front it also balances the rest of the look really well
defrl-3iyce_12-5-rgb_front by blending the nice dewy glow that we have given her skin with the lips
defrl-3iyce_13-5-rgb_front so this is how you would want to complete this baby doll make up look
defrl-3iyce_2-5-rgb_front it has a little bit of shine to it a little bit of sparkle
defrl-3iyce_3-5-rgb_front that is going to go really well the nice glowing look that we have given her skin
defrl-3iyce_4-5-rgb_front so we are going to take a little bit of this on our lip brush
defrl-3iyce_5-5-rgb_front we are just going to do it right in the center of the lips
defrl-3iyce_6-5-rgb_front give the lips a poutier look and give the lips a little bit of sheen
defrl-3iyce_7-5-rgb_front so by doing the lip gloss just right in the center of the lip it gives a nice brightness and a nice shine
defrl-3iyce_8-5-rgb_front so it catches the light and it will make the lips look a lot fuller
defrl-3iyce_9-5-rgb_front so you can see it gives her a nice little pop of shine right in the center of the lips
dfs78sd76ek_0-4-rgb_front how do you tell if your crab is dead
dfs78sd76ek_1-4-rgb_front well crabs can often look dead but not be dead
dfs78sd76ek_10-4-rgb_front he does not want to have anything to do with me
dfs78sd76ek_11-4-rgb_front he is not limp he is not falling easily out of his shell his legs do not move around easily if i push on them
dfs78sd76ek_12-4-rgb_front he is in control of his own body
dfs78sd76ek_13-4-rgb_front the other test is the sniff test
dfs78sd76ek_14-4-rgb_front give him a sniff
dfs78sd76ek_15-4-rgb_front trust me if he is dead you will smell it
dfs78sd76ek_16-4-rgb_front there is nothing quite like the smell of a dead crab and it is pretty pungent and it is pretty obvious so if he does not smell and he is not limp he is alive
dfs78sd76ek_17-4-rgb_front he may be shy he may be grumpy but he is alive
dfs78sd76ek_2-4-rgb_front for instance this guy he is been sitting here he is not moving
dfs78sd76ek_3-4-rgb_front he does not seem to respond to anything but i can assure you he is not dead and i can tell you how i know why
dfs78sd76ek_4-4-rgb_front there is two tests i like to do to find out if the crab is dead
dfs78sd76ek_5-4-rgb_front there is the limp test which is is the crab limp
dfs78sd76ek_6-4-rgb_front does he move around easily
dfs78sd76ek_7-4-rgb_front no he is in there hard
dfs78sd76ek_8-4-rgb_front he does not want to move
dfs78sd76ek_9-4-rgb_front he is just being kind of a stinker
dfzqxh4r1ma_0-8-rgb_front one way to get your poetry published is to write and send it in to magazines
dfzqxh4r1ma_1-8-rgb_front magazines sometimes will print poetry and even sometimes will pay for poetry
dfzqxh4r1ma_2-8-rgb_front another way is submit your pieces through anthology and collections
dfzqxh4r1ma_3-8-rgb_front even if they do not pay you are getting your poetry published into a book format
dfzqxh4r1ma_4-8-rgb_front and usually anthologies will give you at least one copy of the book and then you buy extra copies for your friends and family
dfzqxh4r1ma_5-8-rgb_front if you have an entire book of poetry that you want to publish you can go to a self publishing or subsidy press
dfzqxh4r1ma_6-8-rgb_front and for very little money you can still have your poetry book formatted in any way that you like and with any kind of cover you want
dfzqxh4r1ma_7-8-rgb_front ok this is one that a poet she wanted it hard cover
dfzqxh4r1ma_8-8-rgb_front she was very specific on the colors that she wanted to use as far as the interior purple
dfzqxh4r1ma_9-8-rgb_front with subsidy press and self publishing printing you can decide all those things for yourself and have the book that you have always wanted
dg-nczwmcom_0-5-rgb_front hi guys
dg-nczwmcom_10-5-rgb_front you just want to basically lightly fill them up
dg-nczwmcom_11-5-rgb_front as you can see i got really nicely thin pieces here that are super thin a lot thinner than your average fajita
dg-nczwmcom_12-5-rgb_front you just want to slice down at an angle basically
dg-nczwmcom_13-5-rgb_front keep your tip down
dg-nczwmcom_14-5-rgb_front make sure not to cut yourself
dg-nczwmcom_15-5-rgb_front since the chicken has been sitting in the foil it has nicely cooled down
dg-nczwmcom_16-5-rgb_front you want to make sure to work with cool chicken
dg-nczwmcom_17-5-rgb_front that way you do not burn yourself
dg-nczwmcom_18-5-rgb_front sooner or later this chicken is going to get a lot hotter when it goes into the oven so do not worry about it being cool
dg-nczwmcom_19-5-rgb_front you want to keep on slicing all the way through
dg-nczwmcom_2-5-rgb_front i am going to show you how to slice your chicken for the chicken enchiladas
dg-nczwmcom_20-5-rgb_front like i said at an angle until you get nice thin little pieces of chicken
dg-nczwmcom_21-5-rgb_front now that we have them sliced up into thin slices like i showed you earlier what you want to do is you want to go and slice the opposite way
dg-nczwmcom_22-5-rgb_front that way we can make little pieces of chicken and it is kind of like shredded chicken
dg-nczwmcom_23-5-rgb_front if you want to chop even more you can
dg-nczwmcom_24-5-rgb_front you can just chop and chop that way it is kind of like shredded chicken and you will have these big chunks of chicken inside your enchiladas
dg-nczwmcom_25-5-rgb_front like i said it is not about the big thick piece of beef or chicken inside your enchilada
dg-nczwmcom_26-5-rgb_front enchiladas are not meant to be filled to the max with big pieces of meat or pounds and pounds of cheese
dg-nczwmcom_27-5-rgb_front that is it on slicing and dicing your chicken
dg-nczwmcom_3-5-rgb_front you want to open them up out of their foil here
dg-nczwmcom_4-5-rgb_front as far as the chicken goes you want to use a nice sharp knife like this it is a chef is knife
dg-nczwmcom_5-5-rgb_front you want to keep your tip down over here and you want to just slice across just like that
dg-nczwmcom_6-5-rgb_front you want to make thin slices as thin as possible
dg-nczwmcom_7-5-rgb_front the reason why you want them so thin is so that it is easier to eat and you will have a lot more pieces to fill your enchiladas
dg-nczwmcom_8-5-rgb_front these chicken enchiladas are not about the chicken or it is not about the beef and it is not about over filling
dg-nczwmcom_9-5-rgb_front you do not want to over fill your enchiladas
di6t6tbk3r0_0-5-rgb_front we are going to be talking about court position
di6t6tbk3r0_1-5-rgb_front in tennis the ball has to go first over the net which is your first challenge and second the ball has to land in the court
di6t6tbk3r0_10-5-rgb_front that is where tracy is standing
di6t6tbk3r0_11-5-rgb_front she is standing on the right side of the court
di6t6tbk3r0_12-5-rgb_front the other side is going to be the left side of the court
di6t6tbk3r0_13-5-rgb_front then we have single lines
di6t6tbk3r0_14-5-rgb_front single lines is when playing one person against another person the ball has to go inside this area and then inside the base line all the way to the second single court single line
di6t6tbk3r0_15-5-rgb_front then we have double lines which are the ones that tracy is pointing on the right side of the area and then it is going to all the way up to the base line and then it is going to go until the end of the white line
di6t6tbk3r0_16-5-rgb_front double lines are used when four people are playing two against two on each side
di6t6tbk3r0_17-5-rgb_front this is basically what the court boundaries are about
di6t6tbk3r0_2-5-rgb_front basically in the court would be the dark area of the court the dark green inside the white lines
di6t6tbk3r0_3-5-rgb_front outside would be everything else
di6t6tbk3r0_4-5-rgb_front depending what we are doing like if we are doing a serve we are playing singles or doubles we are going to have different lines that we are going to be talking about
di6t6tbk3r0_5-5-rgb_front the main line is the base line as the name says
di6t6tbk3r0_6-5-rgb_front i am standing on it right now
di6t6tbk3r0_7-5-rgb_front you want to stay on the center of the court which is where the small t is
di6t6tbk3r0_8-5-rgb_front you basically want to recover the center of the court after you hit every shot
di6t6tbk3r0_9-5-rgb_front then you have your service line
djanvtfxgzq_0-5-rgb_front alright now we are going to show you how to read and write on some sheet music in the key of e flat
djanvtfxgzq_1-5-rgb_front so we will start with this nice piece of blank paper
djanvtfxgzq_10-5-rgb_front so if you go back in the video and look in the pattern you can see those notes and now you can go see them on a piece of paper
djanvtfxgzq_2-5-rgb_front first you have your two basic clefts your treble cleft and your basic cleft so we will start here
djanvtfxgzq_3-5-rgb_front there is our treble cleft and e flat is this very first line
djanvtfxgzq_4-5-rgb_front now each line and space is a note in the scale so the notes in between the scale i notated was a flat or a sharp
djanvtfxgzq_5-5-rgb_front here is your sharp symbol
djanvtfxgzq_6-5-rgb_front now to make it easier on you what they do is they put the treble cleft there and they put the three flats already in
djanvtfxgzq_7-5-rgb_front see that e flat e flat and a flat
djanvtfxgzq_8-5-rgb_front so now when we go through and play your scale you will know that when you get to an a flat b flat or e flat it is going to be flat
djanvtfxgzq_9-5-rgb_front so there are your notes
dk4orp3d7wa_0-8-rgb_front the term insomnia comes from the greek literally meaning lack of sleep or no sleep
dk4orp3d7wa_1-8-rgb_front when people think of a sleep disorder i think insomnia commonly pops into the head
dk4orp3d7wa_10-8-rgb_front it is not uncommon for a primary care physician to refer a patient on to a sleep disorders physician when a temporary prescription or something like that fails to aid the insomnia patient or if the insomnia continues beyond the span of to days
dk4orp3d7wa_2-8-rgb_front most people at some point in their lives experience a mild case of insomnia that comes and goes sometimes in response to stress grief or depression
dk4orp3d7wa_3-8-rgb_front insomnia has a number of different causes
dk4orp3d7wa_4-8-rgb_front it has a number of different ways to be relieved
dk4orp3d7wa_5-8-rgb_front it all depends on sort of what is going on or the underlying cause of the insomnia
dk4orp3d7wa_6-8-rgb_front it is not uncommon for children to have bouts of insomnia or for adults
dk4orp3d7wa_7-8-rgb_front generally insomnia resolves itself
dk4orp3d7wa_8-8-rgb_front when insomnia does not resolve when people have chronic problems getting asleep or when that lack of sleep is causing irritability fatigue or other issues during the day that is when we see people in the sleep disorders office for insomnia
dk4orp3d7wa_9-8-rgb_front patients are often seen when a primary care physician issues a prescription for a sleep aid such as ambien lunesta or something of the like that you have seen on tv and for some of the other medications that we may have
dkgsr1jdrf4_1-5-rgb_front okay the last stretch we just did was a stretch for your tricep the next stretch we are going to do is one that really isolates the shoulder
dkgsr1jdrf4_2-5-rgb_front so if i am going to stretch my right shoulder reaching across my right arm i take my left hand i place it on my right elbow and i really push and i reach so i am reaching with my right i am pushing with my left across my body like this
dkgsr1jdrf4_3-5-rgb_front so it is really going to get the stretch right in the back of the shoulder area as such
dkgsr1jdrf4_4-5-rgb_front now you can pull back with the hand or you can put the inside of your left forearm and really just really get that pull to really get that stretch in the back of your shoulder
dkgsr1jdrf4_5-5-rgb_front so from the starting position here bring the arm across reach up pull across hold it for about seconds
dkgsr1jdrf4_6-5-rgb_front and that is another good shoulder stretch
dkdw6immdxa_1-11-rgb_front now we are going to talk about tires and tire wears
dkdw6immdxa_10-11-rgb_front so you definitely you want to keep a eye on the thread especially on the sides and the middle
dkdw6immdxa_2-11-rgb_front this here is a good tire it is a factor tire
dkdw6immdxa_3-11-rgb_front it has plenty of thread in the middle on the sides
dkdw6immdxa_4-11-rgb_front this tire is off a bike that as you can see it is worn out this here went way to far
dkdw6immdxa_5-11-rgb_front you should never ride your tires especially when you got strips in the middle where the threads are coming through
dkdw6immdxa_6-11-rgb_front the side walls on this tire are really thin which you do not want to let that happen
dkdw6immdxa_7-11-rgb_front if you do not have a lot of thread on the side you know you have the tendency to slide out in cornering
dkdw6immdxa_8-11-rgb_front most of your tire would wear out in the middle first because most times you are riding straight
dkdw6immdxa_9-11-rgb_front just keep your eye out on both the front and the rear tires and check on that cause this here is what keeps your bike from falling in the ground
dleyymqiz5m_0-3-rgb_front you just received a lawsuit in the mail and you want free legal advice
dleyymqiz5m_1-3-rgb_front hello i am robert todd and i am here to answer the question how to get free legal advice
dleyymqiz5m_2-3-rgb_front well generally in most states there is a or an availability for free legal advice from legal aid societies and legal aid clinics if you qualify from an income standpoint
dleyymqiz5m_3-3-rgb_front you have to make less than a certain threshold
dleyymqiz5m_4-3-rgb_front you have to check with your individual state or county to determine what that threshold is
dleyymqiz5m_5-3-rgb_front there is also numerous websites on the internet that supposedly offer free legal advice and i would caution you that when you avail yourself of these services you are getting exactly that what you are paying for free legal advice
dleyymqiz5m_6-3-rgb_front if you need legal advice you are probably better off to seek the services of an attorney or someone specialized in the area of the law that your problem is concern
dleyymqiz5m_7-3-rgb_front i am robert todd and than you for watching
doufx5-exyc_0-3-rgb_front in the table leg extension the table posture itself is very good for strengthening back and shoulders and arms but the leg extension is going to bring it in for your lower back connecting it all the way to the shoulders
doufx5-exyc_1-3-rgb_front you take the hands right down into the floor and when you do this you take both feet in the floor and you are going to lift yourself up
doufx5-exyc_10-3-rgb_front inhale exhale inhale and exhale
doufx5-exyc_11-3-rgb_front one more time right and left
doufx5-exyc_12-3-rgb_front inhale and exhale and inhale and exhale release
doufx5-exyc_13-3-rgb_front come right down
doufx5-exyc_2-3-rgb_front many people can only take their hips off the floor just a little bit because they feel the pressure inside their shoulders and arms
doufx5-exyc_3-3-rgb_front you can build that resistance by taking slow steps into this posture
doufx5-exyc_4-3-rgb_front if you can lift your belly right up and rest your head right back
doufx5-exyc_5-3-rgb_front take a deep breath in and lift that right leg straight out and then exhale
doufx5-exyc_6-3-rgb_front bring it down and touch the floor
doufx5-exyc_7-3-rgb_front inhale left leg goes out and exhale come down keeping your belly up
doufx5-exyc_8-3-rgb_front inhale and exhale
doufx5-exyc_9-3-rgb_front inhale and exhale
doc7deipdqo_0-8-rgb_front all middleweight cycles are going to have a chain guard they all came with chain guards
doc7deipdqo_1-8-rgb_front this is a nice looking chain guard again it is got the space age style you would find on a middleweight cycle
doc7deipdqo_10-8-rgb_front again the thing that really surprises me in looking at this particular middleweight is the gear ratios it is geared very high
doc7deipdqo_11-8-rgb_front another way to identify bicycles sometimes you will get a bicycle and there will not be any identifying marks on it maybe somebody has spray painted it or whatever
doc7deipdqo_12-8-rgb_front you can look at this chain ring and there are data bases on the web that show different variations of chain rings but you can determine the manufacturer of this bike just based on this chain ring
doc7deipdqo_2-8-rgb_front it swoops back up to a point kind of reminiscent of the fins of the cars that were produced in the same era
doc7deipdqo_3-8-rgb_front now if you will look at this chain ring this is called the chain ring it is huge it is fifty two teeth
doc7deipdqo_4-8-rgb_front this greatly effects the gearing of the bicycle
doc7deipdqo_5-8-rgb_front it is a single speed bicycle but a chain ring like this gives you a gear ratio that is like you are in a higher gear
doc7deipdqo_6-8-rgb_front so a bike like this going up hill was probably kind of hard but on a flat or going down hill the kid on this bike was probably the fastest kid around
doc7deipdqo_7-8-rgb_front the chain works just like a standard chain on todays cycles
doc7deipdqo_8-8-rgb_front it is a standard size you can still buy this sized chain
doc7deipdqo_9-8-rgb_front you see it comes around to the back sprocket here this is a twenty tooth sprocket
dpbciyelwjg_0-5-rgb_front hello this is financial planner patrick munro checking in with you today on reverse annuity mortgages really known as reverse mortgages for short

dpsmwzmmouw_0-8-rgb_front now i am going to talk to you about specific details about the collared shirt that goes underneath your tailored jacket or your tailored vest or your tailored coat etcetera
dpsmwzmmouw_1-8-rgb_front you might run in to an issue where the tailor or the designer says would you like a spread collar or would you like a tab collar
dpsmwzmmouw_10-8-rgb_front very standard
dpsmwzmmouw_11-8-rgb_front regular
dpsmwzmmouw_12-8-rgb_front and then the spread collar it is going to be a shorter collar and there is going to be more space in between here more space and it is a little bit shorter
dpsmwzmmouw_13-8-rgb_front and then conversely is the tab collar
dpsmwzmmouw_14-8-rgb_front and the tab collar is going to have extra space up here
dpsmwzmmouw_15-8-rgb_front it is probably i would say in my opinion you are going to use it when you are more getting more dressed up
dpsmwzmmouw_16-8-rgb_front it is definitely a little bit more formal and it has more of a of a collar length
dpsmwzmmouw_17-8-rgb_front it stands up higher
dpsmwzmmouw_18-8-rgb_front and then finally this is more business attire
dpsmwzmmouw_19-8-rgb_front you are going to have button down on the sides it is just going to have the buttons
dpsmwzmmouw_2-8-rgb_front would you like your collar to have buttons
dpsmwzmmouw_20-8-rgb_front you are going to button down so you can it is not going to move when you put your tie underneath it it is going to stay
dpsmwzmmouw_21-8-rgb_front so those are the four collars that are pretty standard pretty typical
dpsmwzmmouw_22-8-rgb_front and you can kind of stay within that guideline and make your choices
dpsmwzmmouw_3-8-rgb_front would you like a regular collar
dpsmwzmmouw_4-8-rgb_front all these different types of collars that you can choose having never seen them you might think to yourself i have no idea what this person is talking about
dpsmwzmmouw_5-8-rgb_front so i am going to go over a couple of line drawings of four basic collars the regular normal collar the spread collar the button color and then the tab collar
dpsmwzmmouw_6-8-rgb_front so i am going to take you to the drawings
dpsmwzmmouw_7-8-rgb_front here we have the regular collar it is very standard
dpsmwzmmouw_8-8-rgb_front it has the top button on the on the on the top piece and then starts down here
dpsmwzmmouw_9-8-rgb_front it is just a regular collar
dq-fxtelks8_0-5-rgb_front let is talk about how to stick your opponent with taking the queen of spades or risking taking the queen of spades
dq-fxtelks8_1-5-rgb_front let is look at this hand right here with the knowledge and this is important with the knowledge that i passed my opponent the queen of spades
dq-fxtelks8_10-5-rgb_front so there is only seven left and one of them is that queen
dq-fxtelks8_11-5-rgb_front so there is only six left that are not the queen of spade
dq-fxtelks8_12-5-rgb_front so if i lead spades twice statistically speaking on the second time if it did not happen on the first time on the second time the guy i passed the queen of spades to is going to be forced to play it
dq-fxtelks8_2-5-rgb_front when we passed three i passed my opponent the queen of spades
dq-fxtelks8_3-5-rgb_front okay
dq-fxtelks8_4-5-rgb_front that being said what i want to do is i want to lead off when clubs are led when that deuce of clubs is going around i want to lead off with this ace of clubs to guarantee that i take the trick
dq-fxtelks8_5-5-rgb_front and then i want to play my highest spade that does not outrank a queen
dq-fxtelks8_6-5-rgb_front and then the next time i want to play my highest spade that does not outrank the queen
dq-fxtelks8_7-5-rgb_front and pretty soon the guy that i passed the queen of spades to is going to be forced to play it
dq-fxtelks8_8-5-rgb_front and the reason is there is a finite number of spades in a deck of cards right
dq-fxtelks8_9-5-rgb_front there are thirteen and i hold six of them six
dq2jztipt_e_0-5-rgb_front hi i am jyler noviello and i am going to teach you how to dribble a soccer ball
dq2jztipt_e_1-5-rgb_front dribbling a soccer ball is one of the most important things in play soccer because if you can not control and dribble the ball it will make it very hard to play the game
dq2jztipt_e_2-5-rgb_front there is a couple different ways you can dribble a soccer ball
dq2jztipt_e_3-5-rgb_front dribbling a ball for accuracy is keeping the ball close to you and not necessarily going for speed
dq2jztipt_e_4-5-rgb_front in doing this you want to use the insides of your feet and dribble the ball one foot and then the other like that
dq2jztipt_e_5-5-rgb_front now if you are dribbling the ball for speed you are going to use a different technique
dq2jztipt_e_6-5-rgb_front you are going to dribble the ball with the laces part of your shoes and you are going to run fast using speed keeping the ball in front of you at all times
dq2jztipt_e_7-5-rgb_front at first it might be kind of difficult to dribble the ball with speed but as you practice dribbling for accuracy the speed will come with time
dq2jztipt_e_8-5-rgb_front and that is how you dribble a soccer ball
dq9eiuhjxio_0-8-rgb_front next thing we are going to talk about is the club face and specifically the grooves on the club face
dq9eiuhjxio_1-8-rgb_front you know you see a lot of those professional golfers out there on sunday afternoon hitting these wedge shots having them check up having them spin the reason why they are creating that spin on that golf ball i should say is because of the grooves in their wedges
dq9eiuhjxio_10-8-rgb_front this is just really important when it comes to the control of your golf ball
dq9eiuhjxio_11-8-rgb_front that can also go into the types of golf balls which we can go into later and what the right golf ball is for you and what you should look at when you go into your golf shop
dq9eiuhjxio_2-8-rgb_front it is really important when your out on the golf course to keep these grooves clean and if you have a bunch of mud on that club face it is not going to spin
dq9eiuhjxio_3-8-rgb_front a perfect example of this is with your driver
dq9eiuhjxio_4-8-rgb_front if you take a look at the driver you will notice there are no grooves on the club face of the driver
dq9eiuhjxio_5-8-rgb_front this reason being is you want to minimize the spin on the golf ball
dq9eiuhjxio_6-8-rgb_front now take a look at your wedge these grooves are going to be deeper and they are going to be a little bit wider and this is really important when controlling the spin on the golf ball
dq9eiuhjxio_7-8-rgb_front the closer you get to the green you want to be able to control the golf ball and stopping when you want it to stop
dq9eiuhjxio_8-8-rgb_front same thing applies with the irons
dq9eiuhjxio_9-8-rgb_front if you take a look at the face club of an iron same thing you want to keep those clean
dqpwvqgwmx8_1-8-rgb_front ok as you can see we have down loaded the image we want to create for our transfer
dqpwvqgwmx8_10-8-rgb_front if it is not i will close out of this and then i could use the image editor or the image editing box and just simply increase it to the size that i want that i want the image to be
dqpwvqgwmx8_11-8-rgb_front once i got it to the size that i am looking for then i will just simply go to the to the print preview making sure that it is the size that i want
dqpwvqgwmx8_12-8-rgb_front and then just go up here and click my print button so that i can print it out
dqpwvqgwmx8_13-8-rgb_front making sure that i am actually printing this out on a test piece of paper which is just a regular blank piece of paper rather than wasting a transfer paper
dqpwvqgwmx8_14-8-rgb_front now we have got our transfer on a on a blank piece of paper and i am ready to print this out on my transfer paper because i like the way this is looking so far
dqpwvqgwmx8_15-8-rgb_front so i will print this out on my transfer paper
dqpwvqgwmx8_16-8-rgb_front i will look my transfer paper making sure that the green line is facing me
dqpwvqgwmx8_17-8-rgb_front so as this goes through the type of printer that i am using it will actually print on the blank side of the transfer paper
dqpwvqgwmx8_18-8-rgb_front my transfer paper is loaded up and i will just hit print again
dqpwvqgwmx8_19-8-rgb_front and now we have the transfer that we want on our transfer paper
dqpwvqgwmx8_2-8-rgb_front i got this in a microsoft office picture manager
dqpwvqgwmx8_20-8-rgb_front and notice the green line is on the back
dqpwvqgwmx8_21-8-rgb_front i can see the transfer through the transfer paper
dqpwvqgwmx8_22-8-rgb_front so this allows me a good idea of what this transfer will look like on the itself
dqpwvqgwmx8_23-8-rgb_front but all of the ink is on this side
dqpwvqgwmx8_24-8-rgb_front we want to make sure that we do not touch the ink on the transfer just yet as soon as it is printed out because the ink will tend to smudge a little bit and we do not want to create that on our
dqpwvqgwmx8_25-8-rgb_front so now we are ready to put this on our
dqpwvqgwmx8_26-8-rgb_front we will just to do a few little things like trimming the excess out and we will be ready to apply this
dqpwvqgwmx8_3-8-rgb_front and i have scaled it to the sized that i believe that i want so i get the best resolution as far as the pixels are concern
dqpwvqgwmx8_4-8-rgb_front once i have in the microsoft office picture manager i will come over here to the flip horizontal because i want this picture to be mirrored so it turns out backwards as i print it out
dqpwvqgwmx8_5-8-rgb_front once it is backwards when it is printed out that makes me know that it will actually look like this on
dqpwvqgwmx8_6-8-rgb_front so hit the hit the flip horizontal button

dqudsojo17s_0-8-rgb_front let is do an unweighted accent with the hip
dqudsojo17s_1-8-rgb_front let is put our feet slightly apart
dqudsojo17s_10-8-rgb_front so you are going to really have to bend your standing leg

dqudsojo17s_25-8-rgb_front do not lean forward on this and do not get too far back
dqudsojo17s_26-8-rgb_front make sure to practice this in the mirror
dqudsojo17s_27-8-rgb_front hand on both sides
dqudsojo17s_3-8-rgb_front lift the heel of your unweighted leg and press the toe into the floor
dqudsojo17s_4-8-rgb_front make sure the ankle is in in our showgirl foot position
dqudsojo17s_5-8-rgb_front the knee is coming off the hip and pointing forward slightly
dqudsojo17s_6-8-rgb_front pull that belly button in
dqudsojo17s_7-8-rgb_front lift your chest and relax your shoulders
dqudsojo17s_8-8-rgb_front we are going to start by lifting the hip up and we are going to do a little step down in two parts

dqx6ku390yu_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is dr art bowler and i am a psychologist in manhattan new york city where i have my own private practice
dqx6ku390yu_1-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about how to recognize senile dementia
dqx6ku390yu_2-8-rgb_front senile dementia is a dementia that could be an alzheimer is type and is related to changes in cognition or thinking but it also involves changes in perception as well and behavior
dqx6ku390yu_3-8-rgb_front some of the changes in cognition involve memory changes not remember what to do how to do something or necessary things that people do every day like shower or bath
dqx6ku390yu_4-8-rgb_front difficulty memorizing and memory procedural issues motor problems a person not being able to move around as they used to and not because of a motor impairment
dqx6ku390yu_5-8-rgb_front also people with senile dementia tend to show behavioral changes like marked agitation changes in mood that are uncharacteristic of the person delusions delusions of paranoia different ideas such as those that are different than the person that you know
dqx6ku390yu_6-8-rgb_front those may be some signs of senile dementia you may notice
dqx6ku390yu_7-8-rgb_front this is dr art bowler and this has been how to recognize senile dementia
drnmejwhy0q_0-2-rgb_front my name is anthony maddaloni and i am going to talk about how to use a camera flash
drnmejwhy0q_1-2-rgb_front now flash photography whether it is built into your camera or external such as this flash is a very important part of photography
drnmejwhy0q_10-2-rgb_front in my hand right here is a sync cord
drnmejwhy0q_11-2-rgb_front this cord is plugged into part of my camera and actually lets me be able to hold this flash or put it onto a light stand to incorporate this in my photography
drnmejwhy0q_12-2-rgb_front i really do love flash photography almost as much as i like natural light photography
drnmejwhy0q_13-2-rgb_front so this is a really important tool to have in doing your photography
drnmejwhy0q_14-2-rgb_front and that is how i would use flash photography
drnmejwhy0q_2-2-rgb_front and at first i have noticed that i had a certain i do not know a fear of flash i just did not like it
drnmejwhy0q_3-2-rgb_front i thought it made people look unnatural it made them look kind of pasty
drnmejwhy0q_4-2-rgb_front but the more i experimented with my flash and the more i learned about photography i found that flash photography was really really awesome
drnmejwhy0q_5-2-rgb_front one way i started figuring it out was that i would just take an image naturally with natural light and then i would either put the pop up flash on my camera on or i would experiment with my external flash and i would take the same image using the flash
drnmejwhy0q_6-2-rgb_front now i would look at my flash and what type of settings are on it
drnmejwhy0q_7-2-rgb_front this particular flash is a hv vivitar flash
drnmejwhy0q_8-2-rgb_front it is color coded on the side and that let is me control how powerful this flash can be put out
drnmejwhy0q_9-2-rgb_front now sometimes i can make it very weak or i can make it very strong depending upon the situation that i am photographing in
dsvw7ak0qqw_0-5-rgb_front the next silhouette is a mermaid or a fish tailed silhouette
dsvw7ak0qqw_1-5-rgb_front this is probably going to be one of the exceptions to your design rules because or to my design rules saying go for it make your own shape out of this make your own design out of my shapes and silhouettes
dsvw7ak0qqw_2-5-rgb_front this one pretty much a mermaid dress is a mermaid dress is a mermaid dress
dsvw7ak0qqw_3-5-rgb_front if it is a mermaid wearing it or it is a pageant queen wearing it or if it is a girl wearing a prom wearing it this one is your variations on it and your own input on it or into it are going to be in the characteristics of it
dsvw7ak0qqw_4-5-rgb_front in order to retain its title of a mermaid dress it has to be hugged to the body and then flared out
dsvw7ak0qqw_5-5-rgb_front it is got to look like ariel did your shopping
dsvw7ak0qqw_6-5-rgb_front ariel is little mermaid is your stylist basically but what makes it different everyone that you see and by every different designer is what they do beyond that how they take the silhouette and build it
dsvw7ak0qqw_7-5-rgb_front whether it is having a symmetrical asymmetric as far as one shouldered or belted
dsvw7ak0qqw_8-5-rgb_front you can do anything but this is the jump off point
duarl5i9xq8_0-5-rgb_front gina and i are going to demonstrate another really great way to stretch your shoulders back and your chest
duarl5i9xq8_1-5-rgb_front gina is going to come on up to her knees and take a seat on her heels and she is going to bring her hands behind her head and open up through her shoulders
duarl5i9xq8_2-5-rgb_front i am going to come and i am going to place my knees on either side of her spine and then i am very gently going to ask gina to tell me when to stop stretching her arms back right there
duarl5i9xq8_3-5-rgb_front then we are just going to pause right here and then give a little more pressure to her back how is that gina
duarl5i9xq8_4-5-rgb_front notice how that is opening up her chest opening up her shoulders good
duarl5i9xq8_5-5-rgb_front now breathe and as she breaths she might find that she can come into it just a little bit deeper and then gently releasing and then that should feel really great on gina is shoulders
duf34jvjjey_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is cindy mastry with yoga etc
duf34jvjjey_2-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to demonstrate the tree and half lotus with a forward fold
duf34jvjjey_3-8-rgb_front this is april and she is going to help me demonstrate the pose
duf34jvjjey_4-8-rgb_front so she is going to ground to her feet and come into a half lotus position
duf34jvjjey_5-8-rgb_front so she is going to take her right heel to her left hip and allow her knee to open out to the side keeping her hips nice and square and level
duf34jvjjey_6-8-rgb_front she is going to inhale in engage her core reach her arms up and as she exhales she is going to lengthen out of her waist and fold forward
duf34jvjjey_7-8-rgb_front if she can bringing her nose to her knee
duf34jvjjey_8-8-rgb_front then reversing all the way back up reaching her arms up to the sky using her core strength and then releasing the pose
duf34jvjjey_9-8-rgb_front that is the tree and half lotus with a forward fold
duibfm91pn0_0-8-rgb_front when choosing a hat choose the hat personally choose it live
duibfm91pn0_1-8-rgb_front if you look through the collection of hats and this is a very small percentage of my hat collection over the years but you will see hats that read and hats that read large hats that read extra large hats that read and
duibfm91pn0_2-8-rgb_front all of these hats fit me and all of them pretty much show different sizes so finding the hat that actually fits you is a matter of trying on the hat
duibfm91pn0_3-8-rgb_front i strongly discourage you from believing that a certain number or a certain size is your hat size and buying a hat based on that number through the mail over the internet things like that
duibfm91pn0_4-8-rgb_front the chances that it will fit are not that good
duibfm91pn0_5-8-rgb_front there are a couple of things that you want to look out for
duibfm91pn0_6-8-rgb_front the first of these is when you put the hat on does it sit comfortably on your head does it fit well and is there enough room that with just gentle pressure you can put a finger in between your hat and the inner band of your hat but still have the hat snug and secure on your head
duibfm91pn0_7-8-rgb_front that is the way to tell if the hat really fits
dv0rkzxmdqc_0-5-rgb_front hi i am gretchen rivas with relax to the max massage therapy and today we are going to talk about how to get a massage
dv0rkzxmdqc_1-5-rgb_front once you have find the massage therapist that you have decided to get a massage from and you can do that through your friends and family referrals the yellow pages or somebody on the web and checking out their website and talking to them on the phone
dv0rkzxmdqc_2-5-rgb_front and once you have booked your massage and the day of it what you want to do is make sure you drink plenty of water before you go and also you might want to rinse off if you have been out running around a lot or you are really dirty please do not go get your massage when you are dirty because that is kind of gross so make sure your feet are clean so they can rub them like you want them rubbed
dv0rkzxmdqc_3-5-rgb_front and once you get there you will fill out some paperwork talk to the therapist they should leave the room while you get undressed and once you do you will get undressed and you will get on the table and you will get underneath the top sheet that they have there
dv0rkzxmdqc_4-5-rgb_front most states not all of them but most states do require draping and so you will be draped and covered the entire time during your massage and so you do not have to worry so much about your modesty everything is always covered and protected and they will just work one body part at a time for you
dv0rkzxmdqc_5-5-rgb_front and once you get on the table the best thing you want to do is just relax take a lot of deep breaths and just breathe into it and know that if your therapist is doing too much and it is hurting you it is your massage and you do have the right to speak up and say that is too much please lighten up your pressure
dv0rkzxmdqc_6-5-rgb_front or if it is not enough you can ask them to give you some more
dv0rkzxmdqc_7-5-rgb_front so remember it is your massage and that is how you want to get a massage
dv9tmqoyqiu_0-8-rgb_front hi this is john stewart and this is how to select an area for building a fire
dv9tmqoyqiu_1-8-rgb_front when you build a fire you want to build it on flat ground
dv9tmqoyqiu_10-8-rgb_front this is key so that when the smoke from the fire rises it has a place to escape
dv9tmqoyqiu_11-8-rgb_front if you have an real high vegetation area in the trees to where the smoke can not build escape the smoke will build up all on your campsite and it will just be miserable for you and your other campers having to breathe smoke and all that
dv9tmqoyqiu_12-8-rgb_front so make sure you have an open area in the trees so that the smoke can escape
dv9tmqoyqiu_13-8-rgb_front lastly try and build your fire off the beaten path
dv9tmqoyqiu_14-8-rgb_front this is so that you do not have it near paths of animals other campers because animals and stuff like that will be naturally drawn to your fire and so you want to be off the beaten path from them
dv9tmqoyqiu_15-8-rgb_front so look for animal tracks and make sure you put it away from them
dv9tmqoyqiu_16-8-rgb_front and this is how you select an area for building a fire
dv9tmqoyqiu_2-8-rgb_front this is so you have the nice stable area to set your fire up and build the fire ring around it
dv9tmqoyqiu_3-8-rgb_front you do not want to put it on a hill
dv9tmqoyqiu_4-8-rgb_front in that case you might have logs that are burning they might take off down the hill and escape so you want to make sure you have a flat stable surface to build your fire around
dv9tmqoyqiu_5-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that you build your fire near a water source
dv9tmqoyqiu_6-8-rgb_front this is key in case you have a accident where the fire gets out
dv9tmqoyqiu_7-8-rgb_front but most importantly so that you have water to actually put the fire out once you are done using it
dv9tmqoyqiu_8-8-rgb_front so make sure you are near water to where you can transport the water to the fire
dv9tmqoyqiu_9-8-rgb_front thirdly you want to look for a open area in the trees
dw_3t1igwx4_1-1-rgb_front okay so one more kick from the muay thai in the beginners series is what we call the switch kick
dw_3t1igwx4_2-1-rgb_front so now in slow motion she does the switch and then extend and still using the shin just like the regular kick
dw_3t1igwx4_3-1-rgb_front so one more time switch the legs change and then pivot and hit okay and then we go switch kick switch kick switch kick switch kick
dw_3t1igwx4_4-1-rgb_front okay now just for a little bit of conditioning we would go switch kick to regular kick
dw_3t1igwx4_5-1-rgb_front go and one more time and one more time and one last time
dwkpttmvx7w_0-8-rgb_front hey welcome back

dwkpttmvx7w_15-8-rgb_front make sure to take a few pictures to give her an idea of what you want
dwkpttmvx7w_16-8-rgb_front my name is sylvia russell and this is how you can pick a hair color
dwkpttmvx7w_2-8-rgb_front first things first always consult a professional
dwkpttmvx7w_3-8-rgb_front now i know some of you at home do not trust professionals with your hair
dwkpttmvx7w_4-8-rgb_front so make sure to read directions on any box that you picked up from the grocery store
dwkpttmvx7w_5-8-rgb_front make sure to compare your hair color with the color on the box
dwkpttmvx7w_6-8-rgb_front this is very important okay
dwkpttmvx7w_7-8-rgb_front so here we have a color ring and this is what i use when i am deciding on a color for my client
dwkpttmvx7w_8-8-rgb_front i give them the option to pick a color and then we can also place it against her to make sure that the color we choose will complement her skin tone
dwkpttmvx7w_9-8-rgb_front now this is something that you may not be able to do with a box of color from the grocery store but in your local beauty supply store you maybe able to pick up a color ring yourself
dwvkuujhmos_0-8-rgb_front rebecca sato hi
dwvkuujhmos_10-8-rgb_front and right now i think this does apply to experienced writers as well but i am primarily speaking to writers who are just starting out
dwvkuujhmos_11-8-rgb_front okay
dwvkuujhmos_12-8-rgb_front here is the you that others see
dwvkuujhmos_13-8-rgb_front okay
dwvkuujhmos_14-8-rgb_front and the others they might see you as a plumber so let is just say that
dwvkuujhmos_15-8-rgb_front you are a plumber
dwvkuujhmos_16-8-rgb_front that is what you are to them
dwvkuujhmos_17-8-rgb_front okay
dwvkuujhmos_18-8-rgb_front and here is the you that you see
dwvkuujhmos_19-8-rgb_front so this is you
dwvkuujhmos_2-8-rgb_front and we are going to talk about and writing
dwvkuujhmos_20-8-rgb_front and you might see yourself as confused know you do not see yourself as a plumber
dwvkuujhmos_21-8-rgb_front very few people see themselves as their job because you are not your job
dwvkuujhmos_22-8-rgb_front that is what you are doing right now but that does not capsulate your mind heart body and soul
dwvkuujhmos_23-8-rgb_front maybe you feel like confused
dwvkuujhmos_24-8-rgb_front you are like i do not feel like i am a plumber
dwvkuujhmos_25-8-rgb_front not there is any wrong about being a plumber and if you are in love in being a plumber that is awesome
dwvkuujhmos_26-8-rgb_front but let is say this is you okay
dwvkuujhmos_27-8-rgb_front and this right here is actually the real you and i realized that the word real is subjective
dwvkuujhmos_28-8-rgb_front but let is talk about this person how to go from this to this and how to find this and we are going to talk about that next
dwvkuujhmos_3-8-rgb_front and the reason this is worth talking about is because a writer and his or her is very interrelated
dwvkuujhmos_4-8-rgb_front i know not everyone is going to agree with me and there have been very disturbed people individuals who were excellent writers
dwvkuujhmos_5-8-rgb_front so i am not saying that you can not is a wide range of people in different mindsets that can write interesting things that are good and people want to read
dwvkuujhmos_6-8-rgb_front so that is not what i am trying to say
dwvkuujhmos_7-8-rgb_front but if you want to be a happy writer here is how to do it
dwvkuujhmos_8-8-rgb_front okay
dwvkuujhmos_9-8-rgb_front so this is going to be about
dx3kwlldijc_0-8-rgb_front to slice the kohlrabi first we are going to cut off these extra bits here and make it as smooth as possible
dx3kwlldijc_1-8-rgb_front and the you will want to cut a flat side so you will not have it rolling around when you are slicing
dx3kwlldijc_10-8-rgb_front so you have a petal that is flexible
dx3kwlldijc_11-8-rgb_front you do not want it to be stiff like this is the end but that is much too stiff
dx3kwlldijc_12-8-rgb_front you want it to be flexible like that
dx3kwlldijc_13-8-rgb_front and you slice the whole vegetable all the way down
dx3kwlldijc_14-8-rgb_front if you get if you make some mistakes like you cut a piece off and you get a lump there you can cut a thicker piece to get flat again and then continue on
dx3kwlldijc_2-8-rgb_front you want to cut down a nice flat side like that
dx3kwlldijc_3-8-rgb_front and then with a large sharp french knife french chef knife you are going to slice off a bit there
dx3kwlldijc_4-8-rgb_front then go about a millimeter two millimeters and slice really thin slices
dx3kwlldijc_5-8-rgb_front you want to keep you knife moving in a nice downward motion
dx3kwlldijc_6-8-rgb_front kind of moving the knife like this at the same time
dx3kwlldijc_7-8-rgb_front if you slice one in half like that do not worry
dx3kwlldijc_8-8-rgb_front maybe you could use it still
dx3kwlldijc_9-8-rgb_front and you want to slice it as thinly as possible
dxznijia918_0-8-rgb_front the path to becoming a pediatrician begins much as it does for any other medical specialty
dxznijia918_1-8-rgb_front you start with a four year course of study at a college or university
dxznijia918_10-8-rgb_front the first two years of medical school focus primarily on didactic instruction in health sciences and the second two years focus primarily on clinical knowledge and skills
dxznijia918_11-8-rgb_front along the way you will need to pass both parts of the united states medical license exam step covering your basic knowledge of health sciences and part covering your basic knowledge of clinical skills
dxznijia918_12-8-rgb_front upon completion of medical school you will become an md however you are not ready to practice yet as a pediatrician
dxznijia918_13-8-rgb_front to practice as a pediatrician you need to apply to a residency program in pediatrics
dxznijia918_14-8-rgb_front this is a period of graduate medical education during which you learn your specialty
dxznijia918_15-8-rgb_front in pediatrics it is a three year residency requirement and some may particularly if in interested in a in pediatrics or in an academic career may choose to complete a fellowship beyond that
dxznijia918_16-8-rgb_front once you have completed a residency and or fellowship your graduate medical education is complete and you can take the state board exam in the state in which you want to practice and you will be able to to practice independently as a pediatrician
dxznijia918_2-8-rgb_front during your bachelor is or undergraduate course of study you will really want to focus on keeping your gpa at or above as medical school is highly competitive
dxznijia918_3-8-rgb_front as you when you are in completion of your undergraduate experience you will need to take what is called the medical college admissions test
dxznijia918_4-8-rgb_front this is a standardized test that all applicants to medical school must take
dxznijia918_5-8-rgb_front it covers the physical sciences biological sciences verbal reasoning and written communication
dxznijia918_6-8-rgb_front if you did not major in a science discipline then you will need to make sure that you have completed all of the science prerequisites to prepare you for the mcat
dxznijia918_7-8-rgb_front once you have taken the mcat you need to actually apply to medical school and this again is a standard process
dxznijia918_8-8-rgb_front most of the medical schools in the united states par participate in what is called amcas and you can apply to one or all of those schools through the application service
dxznijia918_9-8-rgb_front once you have applied to medical school and are accepted you will begin your formal medical training which is an additional four year course of study beyond your undergraduate education
d_w6t4no-ka_0-8-rgb_front my name is mike lewis with christian martial arts
d_w6t4no-ka_1-8-rgb_front we are talking about how to throw ninja stars
d_w6t4no-ka_10-8-rgb_front pretty much the mindset is like you are trying to crack a whip or a towel and you take and get it there and you have got to first snap it back just a tad bit to get it to pop
d_w6t4no-ka_11-8-rgb_front so that is what you are doing you are taking your ninja star and when you try to actually crack the whip per say you are actually spinning your ninja star through so that will actually have enough torque and enough force to stick them to your target
d_w6t4no-ka_12-8-rgb_front the same thing with this one
d_w6t4no-ka_13-8-rgb_front you pretty much just tilt it back
d_w6t4no-ka_14-8-rgb_front a lot of people have great aim going around this way but they are able to get a better spin tossing it just like a frisbee
d_w6t4no-ka_15-8-rgb_front so you have to find what is best for you
d_w6t4no-ka_16-8-rgb_front same thing you grab it by the tip you hold it to your side you just let it out just like you would a frisbee and when you get your arm executed fully out you just want to sort of snap it out
d_w6t4no-ka_17-8-rgb_front you do not want to let your arm pass too far because then your release will be off and you will throw the ninja star off so you want to make sure that your arm is locked out to wherever you are throwing your ninja star at
d_w6t4no-ka_18-8-rgb_front that is just a little bit more information about ninja stars and how to get started in throwing
d_w6t4no-ka_2-8-rgb_front there are several different styles and different ways to throw ninja stars
d_w6t4no-ka_3-8-rgb_front there is also many different styles of ninja stars themselves
d_w6t4no-ka_4-8-rgb_front as you can see here i have one that has four points on it and one here that actually has five points on it
d_w6t4no-ka_5-8-rgb_front this one is shaped more like a star
d_w6t4no-ka_6-8-rgb_front but you will find some that have three four points
d_w6t4no-ka_7-8-rgb_front they have different weights different thicknesses all that kind of stuff so when you buy ninja stars take a look at them and make sure you are not getting ripped off by buying some really cheap ones and metal ones that will bend after a few throws get some kinds that are going to be very sturdy when you throw them because they will bend depending on how hard you throw
d_w6t4no-ka_8-8-rgb_front also the style of the ninja star sort of depends on how much spin you put on it to make it stick so that is something that when you buy a ninja star go out and sort of experiment with it and get a good feel of it and you may have to put more force behind your spin or vice versa more spin than force
d_w6t4no-ka_9-8-rgb_front the first way to start out throwing a ninja star one of the basic ways is to just grab near the tip and i like to turn mine slightly back to help get some spin on to it and so when i throw it i sort of side arm it throw it release and try to put as much spin on the star as i execute
db5suqvnshc_0-1-rgb_front part of the fun of pokemon is that it is a collectible card game
db5suqvnshc_1-1-rgb_front a lot of you might look at the amount of cards that you could amass over quite a bit of time and you think what the heck am i going to do with all these cards

db5suqvnshc_17-1-rgb_front a bunch of ex is
db5suqvnshc_18-1-rgb_front oh
db5suqvnshc_2-1-rgb_front well the fun part is building different kinds of decks
db5suqvnshc_3-1-rgb_front you do not have to play with the same deck
db5suqvnshc_4-1-rgb_front you can always build yourself different decks keep one build another one build another one
db5suqvnshc_5-1-rgb_front that is why i have got all these cards
db5suqvnshc_6-1-rgb_front sometimes i feel like playing fire sometimes i feel like playing water
db5suqvnshc_7-1-rgb_front a lot of people are used to when you are playing card games and you have got the one deck of cards and you just play with that deck over and over again it never changes
db5suqvnshc_8-1-rgb_front with pokemon you build your own deck use different creatures different energies and you play with that deck or a different deck you build and that is sort of the difference is that you do not use the same deck of cards and that is one of the reasons it makes it a collectible card game because you collect all these cards to make all these different decks
db5suqvnshc_9-1-rgb_front i would love for my assistant here to show you many of his different decks that he has built over time
dcfcy1ofhcw_1-3-rgb_front i am travis connelly and i am a state certified
dcfcy1ofhcw_10-3-rgb_front you should stop obviously
dcfcy1ofhcw_11-3-rgb_front when you drop do not just throw yourself to the ground
dcfcy1ofhcw_12-3-rgb_front ease yourself down you do not want to cause any more injury
dcfcy1ofhcw_13-3-rgb_front lay down as far as you can so that you can roll and cover all parts of your body
dcfcy1ofhcw_14-3-rgb_front make sure that you roll completely over several times to make sure that everything gets smothered out
dcfcy1ofhcw_3-3-rgb_front we have reviewed several safety measures in case of a fire what you should do
dcfcy1ofhcw_4-3-rgb_front what happens if your clothes catch on fire
dcfcy1ofhcw_5-3-rgb_front everyone has heard the old safety rule stop drop and roll
dcfcy1ofhcw_6-3-rgb_front do you always practice this
dcfcy1ofhcw_7-3-rgb_front maybe you should practice this during your fire drill
dcfcy1ofhcw_8-3-rgb_front it is pretty simple in explanation but you should keep in mind some key factors
dcfcy1ofhcw_9-3-rgb_front if your clothes catch fire running around will not help
dcazwbc3sxk_1-8-rgb_front today we are making a drawer handle out of bone
dcazwbc3sxk_10-8-rgb_front i do not think we are going to need to use this
dcazwbc3sxk_11-8-rgb_front we can can make a clasp just like this that even though this one will not go in i am going to make one like this that will fit in this hole and work just fine
dcazwbc3sxk_12-8-rgb_front so now we are going to do the back just like we did the front with the exception of this hole
dcazwbc3sxk_13-8-rgb_front we are just going to drill the hole and me
dcazwbc3sxk_14-8-rgb_front hollow it out with the polish
dcazwbc3sxk_2-8-rgb_front we just put the drill bit in and drill the hole in the center of the first hole that we were attempting to make
dcazwbc3sxk_3-8-rgb_front i am going to take the polishing bit
dcazwbc3sxk_4-8-rgb_front and i am going to actually make the hole big enough that i can cut down farther in with my grinding bit
dcazwbc3sxk_5-8-rgb_front we are not do not need to go all the way through with either one
dcazwbc3sxk_6-8-rgb_front so i am just going to go in until the hole appears to be wide enough that i can cut down a little further with this one
dcazwbc3sxk_7-8-rgb_front so with the dremel on low
dcazwbc3sxk_8-8-rgb_front we made the hole a little bit rounder and wider
dcazwbc3sxk_9-8-rgb_front originally i was going to use this bit to go all the way through but that hole is looking really really good
dcnh1gxzils_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to discuss the use of black and white and color elements in our company logo
dcnh1gxzils_1-8-rgb_front for this task we will be using adobe illustrator for its useful layout capabilities
dcnh1gxzils_10-8-rgb_front in this case you probably would not want to use a dark spot color like a blue or brown for instance since much of the logo is detail will blend into the background rendering the design ineffective
dcnh1gxzils_11-8-rgb_front try different combinations of spot colors that will work no matter what the background
dcnh1gxzils_12-8-rgb_front there are some instances when the designer will be forced to use a black and white logo due to budget constraints
dcnh1gxzils_13-8-rgb_front often times fliers business cards vehicle graphics and broadcast graphics can present other challenges to the designer
dcnh1gxzils_14-8-rgb_front once such challenge is to take their logo design and reduce it to a single color that still retains its effectiveness
dcnh1gxzils_15-8-rgb_front this is where a strong logo icon and bold logo type will really stand out
dcnh1gxzils_16-8-rgb_front the smart designer will always consider the colors and the final use when beginning the design process
dcnh1gxzils_17-8-rgb_front this concludes are look at incorporating black and white and color in our logo design
dcnh1gxzils_2-8-rgb_front now illustrator is a registered trademark of adobe and i am in no way affiliated with adobe
dcnh1gxzils_3-8-rgb_front a logo presented in vivid color will grab people is attention
dcnh1gxzils_4-8-rgb_front however there are many occasions when the use of a logo just will not be practical
dcnh1gxzils_5-8-rgb_front when the budget allows a full color logo will always be the most affective but the smart use of a spot color can be just as eye catching
dcnh1gxzils_6-8-rgb_front a spot color is a secondary color that compliments the primary color on your logo
dcnh1gxzils_7-8-rgb_front one of the most important things you should consider is how you will use your finished logo
dcnh1gxzils_8-8-rgb_front a design that will most often be printed on a white background for instance will open up endless spot color options
dcnh1gxzils_9-8-rgb_front conversely a logo that is destined to be displayed on a solid black background primarily will limit the spot color choices
dcpsacbj81w_0-5-rgb_front hi this is zephyr with miami dog training in miami florida
dcpsacbj81w_1-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about how to teach your dog not to run away
dcpsacbj81w_10-5-rgb_front we tell him to stay
dcpsacbj81w_11-5-rgb_front once the dog is taught to stay you do not have to worry about him running away
dcpsacbj81w_12-5-rgb_front you can drop the leash as long as the dog is obedience trained that is a big major part
dcpsacbj81w_13-5-rgb_front my name is zephyr and this is miami dog training
dcpsacbj81w_2-5-rgb_front first thing you really want to pay attention to is the leash
dcpsacbj81w_3-5-rgb_front this is your number one tool for being in control so the first rule about letting your dog not letting your dog run away is control and opportunity
dcpsacbj81w_4-5-rgb_front if they do not have the opportunity to run away they are not going to do it
dcpsacbj81w_5-5-rgb_front you know as far as training goes in the beginning we start with a five to six foot leash
dcpsacbj81w_6-5-rgb_front i prefer a five cause it is less material to have to work with
dcpsacbj81w_7-5-rgb_front but just the same all the training first starts with the leash
dcpsacbj81w_8-5-rgb_front if you can not get the dog to do something on the leash how are you going to get him to do something off the leash or for that matter if you drop the leash
dcpsacbj81w_9-5-rgb_front so one of the biggest things is teaching the dog to stay
dd6r7jx4voq_1-3-rgb_front today we are going to be talking about buying a new car
dd6r7jx4voq_10-3-rgb_front what they are giving you is what is referred to as a trade allowance
dd6r7jx4voq_11-3-rgb_front which means the new car that you are purchasing they are adding the discount that they are taking from that car to the value of the trade that you have to tell you a number that is called a trade allowance
dd6r7jx4voq_12-3-rgb_front which is a combination of both a discount on your new car and the actual cash value for the amount of money they are giving you on your
dd6r7jx4voq_13-3-rgb_front so remember do your homework
dd6r7jx4voq_14-3-rgb_front find out what your is worth
dd6r7jx4voq_2-3-rgb_front in this segment we are going to talk about
dd6r7jx4voq_3-3-rgb_front if you have an old car that you are trading in whether or not there is an existing loan most dealerships will tell you we will pay off any trade which is very true because in order for you to get a loan on your new car they have to pay off the old loan on your old car
dd6r7jx4voq_4-3-rgb_front so if you are buried or upside down which is the terminology for having negative equity which means you owe more on your car then it is currently worth
dd6r7jx4voq_5-3-rgb_front regardless of whether they tell you meaning the dealership that we will pay off any trade at any time if you are trading in that car it will be shown as a paid off
dd6r7jx4voq_6-3-rgb_front remember there are lots of tricks that dealerships use and word they use in order to make you feel a little more comfortable in what is happening
dd6r7jx4voq_7-3-rgb_front terminology for will vary
dd6r7jx4voq_8-3-rgb_front based on what you know your knowledge to be your car is worth get out there and find out before you your car how much its worth
dd6r7jx4voq_9-3-rgb_front just because the dealerships say they are giving you x amount of dollars for your does not necessarily mean that they are

de2llnxyz1u_11-5-rgb_front the call waiting is another good way to take advantage of the telephone to do two calls at the same time

de2llnxyz1u_2-5-rgb_front the first thing you need to be aware of is that telephone has got numbers on it from on the on the telephone pad
de2llnxyz1u_3-5-rgb_front if it is a local number you just need to dial the seven digits without the area code
de2llnxyz1u_4-5-rgb_front if it is a long distance number you have to put in front of the number to reach a long distance number and the call goes to without even thinking about it
de2llnxyz1u_5-5-rgb_front so keep track of the phone number that you have to call regularly and as long as your phone actually has a memory you can actually save those telephone numbers

dfnfg8p46xc_1-2-rgb_front laundry rooms are small usually small and of course it is more of a little working room but it is fun to make it your own
dfnfg8p46xc_10-2-rgb_front go on and decorate it like you would even a powder room or a small room but have fun with it
dfnfg8p46xc_11-2-rgb_front you also want to deck it out where it has the things you need cute baskets maybe a bar going across that has that you can hang clothes and hang towels on
dfnfg8p46xc_12-2-rgb_front really organize it make it very clean because you have your clean clothes in there
dfnfg8p46xc_13-2-rgb_front but really make it fun
dfnfg8p46xc_14-2-rgb_front i have taken laundry rooms and put a real bright fun coat of orange in a room and it just gives you energy and it is really zippy
dfnfg8p46xc_15-2-rgb_front so this is ann myrick and have fun with your laundry room
dfnfg8p46xc_2-2-rgb_front it is fun to make it fun
dfnfg8p46xc_3-2-rgb_front so you can bring in fun wallpaper
dfnfg8p46xc_4-2-rgb_front i am a decorator and i work with what people have but a lot of times the laundry room is a place that we will do something really fun
dfnfg8p46xc_5-2-rgb_front since it is little you can do a fun technique or a fun paper because you are not going to need very much
dfnfg8p46xc_6-2-rgb_front i am not a big paper person but i do think it is fun to put a wild fun paper in a laundry room or a fun color
dfnfg8p46xc_7-2-rgb_front this laundry room has a great color in it but it is not really a fun color
dfnfg8p46xc_8-2-rgb_front it is the color that goes with the rest of the house and you can just break the mold and do whatever makes you kind of energetic a bright apple green an orange
dfnfg8p46xc_9-2-rgb_front you could put stripes in it you could put fun pictures
dg2djtvcgww_0-4-rgb_front o k so now that we know the footwork we are going to show you how to do the in and out together
dg2djtvcgww_1-4-rgb_front the first version of the in and out is a one handed in and out
dg2djtvcgww_10-4-rgb_front here we are going to do an open break so we will push on one pull on two now here is what we want to do we want to pull the girl forward and make her turn at the same time
dg2djtvcgww_11-4-rgb_front so you want to pull her this way and let go
dg2djtvcgww_12-4-rgb_front so this is push pull let go and then you are going to stop her on the hip
dg2djtvcgww_13-4-rgb_front so basically you want to get her started turning but then you want to stop her before she turns too far
dg2djtvcgww_14-4-rgb_front so you want to end up right behind her
dg2djtvcgww_15-4-rgb_front this is push pull stop her o k
dg2djtvcgww_16-4-rgb_front your fingers are wrapped around in front of her hip bone not here where you are going to tickle her but down here on her hip bone
dg2djtvcgww_17-4-rgb_front that way if she tries to turn too much you are holding her back
dg2djtvcgww_18-4-rgb_front so this is three ladies we want to keep our arms at home base so that we are not getting in his way blocking the hip
dg2djtvcgww_19-4-rgb_front so this is three now again this is an inside turn so it follows the same patterns as the other inside turns
dg2djtvcgww_2-4-rgb_front o k so in order to get into the proper position we are going to do a transition with a cross body lead
dg2djtvcgww_20-4-rgb_front we are going to push her forward on five turn her on six catch her on seven
dg2djtvcgww_21-4-rgb_front so the right hand pushes her that way on five the left hand catches her and gives her a turn on six and then we use the right hand to catch her on seven just like before behind the back ladies that is your cue to get your arm up and over
dg2djtvcgww_22-4-rgb_front so all together it looks like this
dg2djtvcgww_23-4-rgb_front we give a cross body lead switch the hand on seven push pull and stop her now push turn and catch and basic two three five six seven
dg2djtvcgww_24-4-rgb_front ladies you also have a couple of options with your arm styling
dg2djtvcgww_25-4-rgb_front on three you can take the arms out if you want to
dg2djtvcgww_26-4-rgb_front you can also take them up and guys if she does that instead of using the shoulder you just use the hip
dg2djtvcgww_27-4-rgb_front so it would look like this five six seven one two three five six seven
dg2djtvcgww_3-4-rgb_front so after we do our basic we are going to do a cross body lead one two three we are going to cross five six on seven we are going to switch hands
dg2djtvcgww_4-4-rgb_front so basically you have her hand in your left hand you are going to hand it over to your right hand
dg2djtvcgww_5-4-rgb_front what you want to avoid doing is bringing the left hand over here to the right hand because that makes the girl feel like she is supposed to turn
dg2djtvcgww_6-4-rgb_front so instead you want to just meet the hands in the middle just like you were shaking hands
dg2djtvcgww_7-4-rgb_front o k
dg2djtvcgww_8-4-rgb_front so we have cross body lead one two three five six switch
dg2djtvcgww_9-4-rgb_front so now you are right to right
dh9xkh0eoma_0-8-rgb_front this is john and in this clip we will be identifying our problems
dh9xkh0eoma_1-8-rgb_front now there is a couple problems with our storm door
dh9xkh0eoma_10-8-rgb_front so by installing a new door we are hoping to fix our air leak
dh9xkh0eoma_11-8-rgb_front now lastly with a storm door our storm door that we are going to be purchasing will have a screen in it where as this one does not
dh9xkh0eoma_12-8-rgb_front that is going to really help the air circulation inside the house
dh9xkh0eoma_2-8-rgb_front fist off it is not a very high quality storm door
dh9xkh0eoma_3-8-rgb_front it is made of weak materials and it is not very insulated
dh9xkh0eoma_4-8-rgb_front additionally the home owner wants a white storm door with the nickel colored hardware
dh9xkh0eoma_5-8-rgb_front now our main entry door also does not have an insulation value that we would like
dh9xkh0eoma_6-8-rgb_front so we are going to be replacing that with a better insulated door
dh9xkh0eoma_7-8-rgb_front now on the inside of our door when the door is shut we can see light through it and that is not a good sign
dh9xkh0eoma_8-8-rgb_front additionally the trim was damaged at some point so we are going to be replacing that also
dh9xkh0eoma_9-8-rgb_front now additionally there is a significant amount of air that leaks through the door on the bottoms on the sides and on the top
dhn9zrgcbbu_0-5-rgb_front we are going to doing the jump
dhn9zrgcbbu_1-5-rgb_front what you need to do with the jump is to teach them to go over them on their own slowly at first
dhn9zrgcbbu_10-5-rgb_front we are just going to do right over inch
dhn9zrgcbbu_11-5-rgb_front and misha jump
dhn9zrgcbbu_12-5-rgb_front good girl
dhn9zrgcbbu_13-5-rgb_front always treat
dhn9zrgcbbu_14-5-rgb_front once they get that down what you need to do is start adding jumps
dhn9zrgcbbu_15-5-rgb_front and how you would do that is get them going and do one at a time
dhn9zrgcbbu_16-5-rgb_front and do jump
dhn9zrgcbbu_17-5-rgb_front good dog
dhn9zrgcbbu_18-5-rgb_front and jump
dhn9zrgcbbu_19-5-rgb_front good dog
dhn9zrgcbbu_2-5-rgb_front and by doing that you just take a treat and tell them jump
dhn9zrgcbbu_20-5-rgb_front and treat at the end of it
dhn9zrgcbbu_21-5-rgb_front always use a lot of praise
dhn9zrgcbbu_22-5-rgb_front another thing you can do with the jump is get a stay sit sit good girl
dhn9zrgcbbu_24-5-rgb_front and you need to start coming over the jumps
dhn9zrgcbbu_26-5-rgb_front good girl
dhn9zrgcbbu_27-5-rgb_front so that they are coming to you and they are not relying you being with them all the time
dhn9zrgcbbu_3-5-rgb_front good dog
dhn9zrgcbbu_4-5-rgb_front as they get better and better you can start raising the jump
dhn9zrgcbbu_5-5-rgb_front jump
dhn9zrgcbbu_6-5-rgb_front good dog
dhn9zrgcbbu_7-5-rgb_front a jump can go up to their full height
dhn9zrgcbbu_8-5-rgb_front with a dog like this would be up to inches
dhn9zrgcbbu_9-5-rgb_front we are not going to take her that high
dilm4237v8s_1-8-rgb_front a great way to choose a dog trainer is through apdt association of pet dog trainers and they are a world wide association dedicated to make them better trainers through education and seminars and through professionals like your veterinarian groomer
dilm4237v8s_2-8-rgb_front they can speed up the process and help you find a certified dog trainer
dilm4237v8s_3-8-rgb_front anybody can put up a sign and say okay i am a dog trainer and start training people is dogs
dilm4237v8s_4-8-rgb_front you want to make sure he is certified and reputable
dilm4237v8s_5-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that he is able to determine your dog is personality and ask questions
dilm4237v8s_6-8-rgb_front the more questions he asks the better he is
dilm4237v8s_7-8-rgb_front you do not want somebody to just say okay let is start training your dog without really knowing much about the dog
dilm4237v8s_8-8-rgb_front but one size fits all method it is kind of old fashioned
dilm4237v8s_9-8-rgb_front so can learn as long as establish a program that will go along with their personality and then they get better instead of worse with the right dog trainer
dlfwkmiqfsa_0-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to discuss how to travel with your fish for a short distance and time
dlfwkmiqfsa_1-5-rgb_front i recommend this being an hour or less
dlfwkmiqfsa_10-5-rgb_front i recommend not feeding your fish hours prior to transport him for traveling
dlfwkmiqfsa_11-5-rgb_front then you just dump your fish in there
dlfwkmiqfsa_12-5-rgb_front what you do is make sure you have air for your fish get a rubber band and you just want to put your rubber band on the top so the water stays in
dlfwkmiqfsa_2-5-rgb_front this is also a similar way that you will be buying a fish from a pet store how they travel
dlfwkmiqfsa_3-5-rgb_front i recommend you taking your fish out of the tank prior to bagging him up so that he does not get all stressed out whenever you take him and put him in the bag
dlfwkmiqfsa_4-5-rgb_front you can buy these bags at convenient stores
dlfwkmiqfsa_5-5-rgb_front you are going to open up your plastic bag
dlfwkmiqfsa_6-5-rgb_front if you buy it yourself i recommend you take or have a bucket or bowl put your bag inside once you get it filled up and get your fish in
dlfwkmiqfsa_7-5-rgb_front you open up your bag fill it up with the water make sure you have enough room for air
dlfwkmiqfsa_8-5-rgb_front as you can see i did
dlfwkmiqfsa_9-5-rgb_front make sure there are no holes in the bag
dmm1whowdya_0-5-rgb_front hi
dmm1whowdya_10-5-rgb_front you do not have to call it a high punch
dmm1whowdya_11-5-rgb_front if you say punch you are going to know that your arm is extended above your head
dmm1whowdya_12-5-rgb_front low punch is down
dmm1whowdya_13-5-rgb_front punch is up
dmm1whowdya_14-5-rgb_front if i have got both of them up that is a touchdown or a punch
dmm1whowdya_15-5-rgb_front i have got a right punch and a left punch
dmm1whowdya_2-5-rgb_front now i am going to take you through the punch
dmm1whowdya_3-5-rgb_front as i said before when you do a touchdown you might often hear that called a punch
dmm1whowdya_4-5-rgb_front you are almost always going to hear this called a right punch rather than a right touchdown
dmm1whowdya_5-5-rgb_front if i have got my arm up in a touchdown position and my left arm is on my hip this is a right punch
dmm1whowdya_6-5-rgb_front if i switch it and i have my left arm up with my right arm bent and on my hip that is a left punch
dmm1whowdya_7-5-rgb_front i can take that down making it a left low punch
dmm1whowdya_8-5-rgb_front i can also do a right low punch
dmm1whowdya_9-5-rgb_front if i have got my arm up like this it is just a punch
dnwpxyly4cc_0-5-rgb_front the letter t is constructed in a completely different way than the usual t is that we have been making since we were in first grade or in kindergarten
dnwpxyly4cc_1-5-rgb_front so again be patient with yourself as you learn this letter because it is going to go against some of the things that we think comprise a t for example it has no straight stroke
dnwpxyly4cc_2_3-5-rgb_front so the first stroke of the t is a curve and if you have been practicing you know that that first curve is very much like the first curve of the o or the a or the c but join to that stroke we make another stroke and this is a little bit different than any strokes that we have made so far and that is to take and pull a stroke across resting on the guideline
dnwpxyly4cc_4-5-rgb_front so i am going to set the pen down and draw stroke to the right and then i am going to pull this stroke into the bowl
dnwpxyly4cc_5-5-rgb_front so we have a t that has a cross bar but instead of a straight spine it has a curve spine
dnwpxyly4cc_6-5-rgb_front and again as we make that mark we are going to pull it and twist the pen just slightly
doase1qfxui_0-3-rgb_front with a simple wound we can go from this step on to the vet wrap with a similar idea
doase1qfxui_1-3-rgb_front i like to start somewhat in the middle to secure that gauze in place putting a little bit of pressure over the wound
doase1qfxui_2-3-rgb_front then i will go up making sure i go high enough to hopefully secure it without it being able to slip down
doase1qfxui_3-3-rgb_front that wrap of course is a handy item something that we ought to have real close by
doase1qfxui_4-3-rgb_front we do not want to pull it so tight that we create any circulatory compromise but we definitely want to wrap and wrap and use as much of it as we think necessary to keep this wrap from slipping down
doase1qfxui_5-3-rgb_front this is the kind of a wrap that we could use on just about any extremity so long as we recognize that if we put this wrap in place we have got to be able to get our fingers underneath at the top and the bottom but keeping it secure enough so that it is not going to slip
doase1qfxui_6-3-rgb_front and as i continue this around you can also if for any reason you thought you can apply a little tape to the end duct tape or something that will help keep this
doase1qfxui_7-3-rgb_front but this usually sticks very well to itself and there is never much trouble in keeping that together
doase1qfxui_8-3-rgb_front i would say that wrap should stay pretty well in place
doase1qfxui_9-3-rgb_front i can still tell if that should soak through and if it were saturated i would know i would need to replace that
doplua7gl8s_0-5-rgb_front how is it going
doplua7gl8s_1-5-rgb_front we just talked about riding the board
doplua7gl8s_10-5-rgb_front here is what you can do to practice riding the board
doplua7gl8s_11-5-rgb_front i am going to face out to the pool
doplua7gl8s_12-5-rgb_front all you are going to do is bounce up and down up and down
doplua7gl8s_13-5-rgb_front try to do it times in a row
doplua7gl8s_14-5-rgb_front what you are concentrating on is pushing the board all the way down and coming up and rising up with the board ok
doplua7gl8s_15-5-rgb_front the second time you land you should feel a nice smooth transition ok
doplua7gl8s_16-5-rgb_front if you have fallen in to the water you are doing a bad job at riding the board ok
doplua7gl8s_17-5-rgb_front here is what it looks like
doplua7gl8s_18-5-rgb_front ok if you can do that times in a row you are on your way to riding the board
doplua7gl8s_2-5-rgb_front remember i told you it is one of the funniest that i see people do
doplua7gl8s_3-5-rgb_front it is because they really do not know how to bounce up and down up and down with the diving board
doplua7gl8s_4-5-rgb_front so what i have got right now for you is a drill that you can practice over and over and over again so you get comfortable bouncing on the board ok
doplua7gl8s_5-5-rgb_front i would suggest before you do anything even trying a dive you really get comfortable and really get used to just bouncing on the end of the board ok
doplua7gl8s_6-5-rgb_front so i am going to go out to the end of the board and i will explain to you what we are going to do
doplua7gl8s_7-5-rgb_front ok right now i am standing on the end of the board
doplua7gl8s_8-5-rgb_front you notice that it is bouncing up and down
doplua7gl8s_9-5-rgb_front what i am actually doing very poorly because i am facing backwards is riding the board right now ok
dpr_fcipiba_10-1-rgb_front on a shortboard my feet are going to go around here front feet around here the middle of the board
dpr_fcipiba_11-1-rgb_front if i was riding a longboard and i was trying to nose ride i would get up to the tip i would wax up there as well
dpr_fcipiba_12-1-rgb_front once we have the base coat applied which is a harder wax we could put on the top coat which is a softer wax and a grippier wax
dpr_fcipiba_13-1-rgb_front now that i have got the wax applied and if i want even more texture and more grip i will use the teeth of the wax comb in a crossing pattern to give me a nice grid
dpr_fcipiba_14-1-rgb_front if you do not have fresh wax i recommend a fresh coat before you start to go surfing
dpr_fcipiba_15-1-rgb_front it that is not handy and all you have is wax comb this will get your through it
dpr_fcipiba_16-1-rgb_front and if you do not have a wax comb a little beach sand will add texture and get you through
dpr_fcipiba_2-1-rgb_front in this clip we are cleaning the dirty wax off of the surfboard so that we can start with a clean surface
dpr_fcipiba_3-1-rgb_front we are going to use a base coat of wax and then a top coat of wax in order to create grip so we do not slip that would be a rookie mistake
dpr_fcipiba_4-1-rgb_front we will even add texture using the teeth side of the wax comb
dpr_fcipiba_5-1-rgb_front i am fortunate to have a hot sunny afternoon
dpr_fcipiba_6-1-rgb_front i am taking the old dirty wax off with the straight edge of the wax comb
dpr_fcipiba_7-1-rgb_front remember to dispose of properly
dpr_fcipiba_8-1-rgb_front now that i have got my board nice and clean i am going to start applying a base coat of wax so the top coat takes
dpr_fcipiba_9-1-rgb_front where you wax the board is going to be influenced by where your feet are going to go

dq8zmp6p_j4_0-8-rgb_front hi
dq8zmp6p_j4_10-8-rgb_front if you have not bought scissors for your scrapbook station yet to go ahead and buy all of them together at once already in an organizing system
dq8zmp6p_j4_11-8-rgb_front you also want to make sure that along with all your decorative scissors you have just a regular pair of scissors for any other cutting you might want to do
dq8zmp6p_j4_12-8-rgb_front a lot of scrapbookers will have a cutting system where you have different utensils that you use to cut different shapes
dq8zmp6p_j4_13-8-rgb_front the easiest way to organize these is just to find a small container where you can stack all these and your little cutting blades
dq8zmp6p_j4_2-8-rgb_front in this series of clips i am going to show you how to organize your various scrapbook supplies
dq8zmp6p_j4_3-8-rgb_front decorative scissors are really fun to use when scrapbooking and they really add a great extra flare to any page
dq8zmp6p_j4_4-8-rgb_front the problem is what to do with all those scissors that you accumulate
dq8zmp6p_j4_5-8-rgb_front if you have a bunch of scrapbook scissors that you bought separately probably one of the best ways to organize those is just to buy a plastic container like this and put all of your scissors in there
dq8zmp6p_j4_6-8-rgb_front that way you can just dump them all in there and dig through them as you need them
dq8zmp6p_j4_7-8-rgb_front if you do not have that many you can always just use a drawer tray like this which is really nice because you can just slide it in a drawer and out of sight out of mind when you are not scrapbooking
dq8zmp6p_j4_8-8-rgb_front if you buy all of your scissors together a lot of times they will come in an organizer all ready
dq8zmp6p_j4_9-8-rgb_front this one is really nice because it spins and you can see all of the different cuts that it makes already on the scissors
drztdpih7bk_0-5-rgb_front so the next step in the oxygen facial is to exfoliate her skin and we are going to be doing that by using a mild scrub and it is actually grounded marble beads so it is going to feel a little abrasive on her skin however my fingertips are gently going over her skin so that we do not abrade you know the surface of her skin
drztdpih7bk_1-5-rgb_front it is really gentle the product is actually working for us so you do not really need to go in there and really scrub super hard the product does everything for us and what a scrub does is kind of exfoliate and remove again you know dirt and oils but any dry skin that is left over and it gives you that soft baby skin feeling
drztdpih7bk_2-5-rgb_front so mainly the first steps or stages of a facial of any facial really you want to prepare the skin and cleansing and exfoliating helps to open the skin is pores so that the skin can receive the other products or ingredients of the rest of the treatment so when the skin is pores are wide open you are going to benefit the most from the treatment
drzpforr8yw_0-5-rgb_front now i am going to speak about tire tread on your vehicle
drzpforr8yw_1-5-rgb_front now as you can see here this is a pretty much a brand new tire so this has got this has got a good amount of tread on it so what you there is an old the old trick that older fellows teach you you can take a penny and then stick abraham lincoln down in there and you can barely see his face then you have like a good amount of tread
drzpforr8yw_2-5-rgb_front but as far as this other tire i have here as you can see the tread is almost completely gone
drzpforr8yw_3-5-rgb_front then another thing by looking at a tread you can also see how like your own alignment in how your vehicle sits as you can see the back side of this tire is almost completely worn out so that would mean that the car is sitting this way and that will cause the tire to wear unevenly
drzpforr8yw_4-5-rgb_front so pretty much if you were to go get your car inspected you would not be able to get the car inspected with this tire on
drzpforr8yw_5-5-rgb_front it is a you want to make sure you have the proper alignment on your vehicle whenever you do get new tires so that they are not wearing unevenly because sometimes if the alignment is off very badly you will get a wavy fashion across the tread and this is another problem this could cause a vibration as you are driving down the street from this being chopped up in this fashion and that is usually what they call tire chop
drzpforr8yw_6-5-rgb_front so this tire looks pretty good right here and this is how your tire should look and this seems to have even wear
drzpforr8yw_7-5-rgb_front and that concludes dealing with tire tread on the automotive vehicle

du41t4cbdds_0-5-rgb_front ok now we are going to check the brake fluid
du41t4cbdds_1-5-rgb_front you locate your brake fluid and it is usually mounted up onto the firewall in your vehicle
du41t4cbdds_10-5-rgb_front this is a synthetic fluid you can also get silicone fluid but it depends on what sort of vehicle you are dealing with
du41t4cbdds_11-5-rgb_front you want to make sure your fluid is always at this max line on the brake reservoir itself
du41t4cbdds_12-5-rgb_front you basically just find it take the cap off make sure there is no debris and add fluid if fluid is needed
du41t4cbdds_13-5-rgb_front we are going to need to add fluid in this situation
du41t4cbdds_14-5-rgb_front you can generally find brake fluid at any auto parts store at a convenient store and even the grocery store because they do have an auto fluid section in there
du41t4cbdds_15-5-rgb_front you also want to make sure that you do not spill if you spill any make sure you clean it off all painted surfaces because it will destroy the paint
du41t4cbdds_16-5-rgb_front that sums up brake fluid checking the brake fluid and what types of brake fluid that you should use in your vehicle
du41t4cbdds_2-5-rgb_front most vehicles are different but generally it is going to be on the left hand side in the corner up on the firewall
du41t4cbdds_3-5-rgb_front you are going to take the cap off make sure you clean the area around the reservoir to make sure you do not get any dirt inside of the fluid itself to contaminate the fluid
du41t4cbdds_4-5-rgb_front you want to make sure you are not contaminating this fluid because it is vital to the car
du41t4cbdds_5-5-rgb_front you want to read the instructions on the cap to make sure that you get the right brake fluid
du41t4cbdds_6-5-rgb_front if your brake fluid gets low then you will not have the proper braking that you need in dyer situations
du41t4cbdds_7-5-rgb_front you want to read your brake fluid to make sure you are putting the right brake fluid in
du41t4cbdds_8-5-rgb_front there is different kinds you can go from dot one on up to dot five or six

dvks20wkix4_0-8-rgb_front in this step we are going to sew the pieces of the animal face to the background fabric
dvks20wkix4_1-8-rgb_front first you are going to need some thread
dvks20wkix4_10-8-rgb_front when i sew the white bit of the panda is eye on there i am going to use white thread
dvks20wkix4_11-8-rgb_front and then when i sew the black pupil of the eye back on i will use the black thread again
dvks20wkix4_12-8-rgb_front you just want to keep consistent with the color of the fabric that you are sewing on
dvks20wkix4_13-8-rgb_front so start with your needle and thread
dvks20wkix4_14-8-rgb_front i have doubled up the thread
dvks20wkix4_15-8-rgb_front knotted it at the end and it is in there
dvks20wkix4_16-8-rgb_front go from the bottom up and you are just going to do a running stitch which basically means you go up and down
dvks20wkix4_17-8-rgb_front up and down
dvks20wkix4_18-8-rgb_front you are going to continue this all the way around the perimeter of your object
dvks20wkix4_19-8-rgb_front keep the stitches even and there should be an even space between them as well
dvks20wkix4_20-8-rgb_front when you are done sewing your animal face it should look something like this
dvks20wkix4_21-8-rgb_front you notice how i used the white thread on the white
dvks20wkix4_22-8-rgb_front the black thread on the black
dvks20wkix4_23-8-rgb_front and it is all securely on the base of my animal face
dvks20wkix4_2_3_4_5_6_7-8-rgb_front some pins scissors and a needle and your pieces so on this we are doing the panda face i am first going to take a pin and pin the fabric to the background fabric
dvks20wkix4_8-8-rgb_front also you want to coordinate the color of your thread to what you are sewing
dvks20wkix4_9-8-rgb_front so right now i am going to be sewing this black bit on so i want black thread
dvq-fc0-lxk_0-5-rgb_front hi i am amelia
dvq-fc0-lxk_1-5-rgb_front and i am going to show you how to scrunch your hair
dvq-fc0-lxk_10-5-rgb_front so i like something that is got a little bit of hold to it
dvq-fc0-lxk_11-5-rgb_front so you just spray the hair with it and then take your hands and just scrunch it
dvq-fc0-lxk_12-5-rgb_front now this is where you can use a dryer or you do not have to you can just leave the house like this with it slightly damp
dvq-fc0-lxk_13-5-rgb_front the more you scrunch it the more body you will get in your hair
dvq-fc0-lxk_14-5-rgb_front but it is all about taking getting that hair into the palm of your hand
dvq-fc0-lxk_15-5-rgb_front you want to grab that hair and squish it and push it up towards the scalp
dvq-fc0-lxk_16-5-rgb_front so grab it and push it up towards the scalp
dvq-fc0-lxk_17-5-rgb_front and that is creating the bend
dvq-fc0-lxk_18-5-rgb_front so that in turn gets you that nice beachy wave look
dvq-fc0-lxk_19-5-rgb_front and that is how you scrunch your hair
dvq-fc0-lxk_2-5-rgb_front the technique with scrunching hair is really all about your hands
dvq-fc0-lxk_3-5-rgb_front you really want to use your hands to kind of get in there and lift that hair
dvq-fc0-lxk_4-5-rgb_front step one you want to make sure your hair is slightly damp it does not need to be soaking wet
dvq-fc0-lxk_5-5-rgb_front just slightly damp
dvq-fc0-lxk_6-5-rgb_front so when you get out of the shower you just want to take your towel and kind of go in and just remove as much water as possible
dvq-fc0-lxk_7-5-rgb_front so that way your styling product does not get diluted
dvq-fc0-lxk_8-5-rgb_front then you want to use some sort of balm cream or mousse in your hair
dvq-fc0-lxk_9-5-rgb_front you can even use a spray gel
dw9swluk-ek_0-5-rgb_front now we are going to do a little coloring on our clown face to really clown it up
dw9swluk-ek_1-5-rgb_front give it some clown makeup
dw9swluk-ek_10-5-rgb_front now i am going to make some nice big eyebrows with this red
dw9swluk-ek_11-5-rgb_front even though it is a permanent marker you want to wait just a little bit on the fun foam to let it dry so that because it will smudge if you touch it right away after
dw9swluk-ek_12-5-rgb_front now we will finish up our clown by adding a little bit of hair on the sides
dw9swluk-ek_13-5-rgb_front you want to put a good amount of glue here on both sides
dw9swluk-ek_14-5-rgb_front and then we will add our fuzzy hair and then we will finish off with we are going to dot some glue just some little dots of glue here and there
dw9swluk-ek_15-5-rgb_front and use these red and blue sequins just here and there to brighten up our clown
dw9swluk-ek_16-5-rgb_front and there is our finished clown mask
dw9swluk-ek_2-5-rgb_front so i am going to do those big eyes with the nice permanent marker
dw9swluk-ek_3-5-rgb_front you want to do just a big arch over both of the eyes like that with nice bright colors
dw9swluk-ek_4-5-rgb_front then i am going to make the eye look bigger by using a black and just fill that it
dw9swluk-ek_5-5-rgb_front that will make the eye look a little bit bigger really wide eyed clown
dw9swluk-ek_6-5-rgb_front you have to be careful not to touch the marker
dw9swluk-ek_7-5-rgb_front let it dry completely or you can smudge
dw9swluk-ek_8-5-rgb_front i made a little smudge here
dw9swluk-ek_9-5-rgb_front if you do that you can always cover it up with some decoration later
dwb2ujchykm_0-5-rgb_front so when you are speaking with your tailor or maybe the rental place where you are going to be renting your suit or someone that is designing and creating something special for you one thing to consider is different neck shapes that you have which are going to kind of alter the shoulder style that your garment is going to be tailored in your jacket specifically
dwb2ujchykm_1-5-rgb_front so if you have a short neck you are going to need a square shoulder if you have a long neck you are going to need more of a sloped shoulder and then if you just have a regular neck you are going to need just a regular shoulder
dwb2ujchykm_10-5-rgb_front within that longer longer meaning meaning this way you know
dwb2ujchykm_11-5-rgb_front and then finally if you have like a short neck and you are stockier it would be squarer from here to here
dwb2ujchykm_12-5-rgb_front same thing
dwb2ujchykm_13-5-rgb_front so maybe these diagrams will help you figure out whether you are a square neck or excuse me a square shoulder a sloping shoulder or normal regular
dwb2ujchykm_2-5-rgb_front so there is different ways to measure that or there is different ways to kind of point out or notice and take into account meaning what type of shoulder you want based on your neck whatever neck you have been given
dwb2ujchykm_3-5-rgb_front and all the necks are fine
dwb2ujchykm_4-5-rgb_front o k
dwb2ujchykm_5-5-rgb_front so most of it is going to be from here to here same as we measured our shoulder seam but i will show it to you on paper so you can kind of tell the difference and decide what you are because maybe you might be living with a long neck and you just do not realize that you have a long neck
dwb2ujchykm_6-5-rgb_front alright so let is look at the pages
dwb2ujchykm_7-5-rgb_front alright so here we are shoulder style normal and that is it is just like we measured before that point that goes from here to here
dwb2ujchykm_8-5-rgb_front and then what we have is a sloping shoulder and as you can see i have showed you here this is for like a longer neck right
dwb2ujchykm_9-5-rgb_front if you have a longer neck kind of bring your shoulders down like that and that is from here to there
dxdbmytzt14_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is adam bowling i am representing the christian martial arts association
dxdbmytzt14_10-8-rgb_front this would be a risky technique for someone who is small on a bigger person
dxdbmytzt14_2-8-rgb_front i am here to talk to you about the aspects of the tigery style
dxdbmytzt14_3-8-rgb_front tamo develop the five animals in mind that everyone is not the same styles
dxdbmytzt14_4-8-rgb_front keeping this in mind he knows that the tiger was also a larger animal than most of the other animals and the tiger is techniques would not be something that a smaller person would be able to use
dxdbmytzt14_5-8-rgb_front the tiger was use as a more of a breaking pinning to the ground type of technique
dxdbmytzt14_6-8-rgb_front the tiger is techniques were head on they were for someone who is stronger and fast and the techniques often show that for example we do a technique called tiger on guard tiger crouches tiger strikes to the throat
dxdbmytzt14_7-8-rgb_front tiger strikes to the throat is a straight on attack
dxdbmytzt14_8-8-rgb_front that aspect this aspect of tiger shows that the person that i am going to be coming against is either smaller than me or close to my size
dxdbmytzt14_9-8-rgb_front this is not a technique you would do to someone who is much bigger than you
dxfiaxnaczi_0-8-rgb_front now i would like to talk about how to anchor your plant
dxfiaxnaczi_1-8-rgb_front by this i mean how to keep your plant from falling over
dxfiaxnaczi_10-8-rgb_front or the plant is very tall
dxfiaxnaczi_11-8-rgb_front or if the plant is placed in a very windy high wind situation
dxfiaxnaczi_12-8-rgb_front you may still have problems with your plant tipping over
dxfiaxnaczi_13-8-rgb_front or for example indoors if you are in a tight traffic area
dxfiaxnaczi_14-8-rgb_front you have got a lot of people walking back and forth
dxfiaxnaczi_15-8-rgb_front people might just run into the plant
dxfiaxnaczi_16-8-rgb_front and it might be in danger of someone knocking it over
dxfiaxnaczi_17-8-rgb_front so in order to make our plant more secure
dxfiaxnaczi_18-8-rgb_front especially when we use a plastic container like this too
dxfiaxnaczi_19-8-rgb_front sometimes the plant just is not heavy enough
dxfiaxnaczi_2-8-rgb_front now if you have centered your plant correctly and you have firmed the soil around the plant
dxfiaxnaczi_20-8-rgb_front and it might tip over
dxfiaxnaczi_21-8-rgb_front so to make it more secure there is a number of techniques that we can use
dxfiaxnaczi_22-8-rgb_front first of all one of my favorite things to do
dxfiaxnaczi_23-8-rgb_front is use some rocks
dxfiaxnaczi_24-8-rgb_front and have a whole bunch of different types of rocks
dxfiaxnaczi_25-8-rgb_front decorative rocks large boulders
dxfiaxnaczi_26-8-rgb_front different sized rocks
dxfiaxnaczi_27_28_29_30-8-rgb_front smooth river rocks we can throw these rocks in with the plant lean it up against the plant and really stabilize the plant that way
dxfiaxnaczi_3-8-rgb_front and your container is not too big for the plant
dxfiaxnaczi_31-8-rgb_front rocks are great because they add weight to the plant
dxfiaxnaczi_32-8-rgb_front and so they add weight to the container to prevent the container from tipping over
dxfiaxnaczi_33-8-rgb_front also they apply pressure to the roots
dxfiaxnaczi_34-8-rgb_front so that the plant will not tip over so easily
dxfiaxnaczi_35-8-rgb_front or we can also use little ornaments like this
dxfiaxnaczi_36-8-rgb_front and broken bricks
dxfiaxnaczi_37-8-rgb_front also we have some wooden sticks
dxfiaxnaczi_38-8-rgb_front you can stick a wooden stick in there
dxfiaxnaczi_39-8-rgb_front and tie the plant with some green plant tape or some string
dxfiaxnaczi_4-8-rgb_front hopefully you should not have too many problems with your plant being unstable
dxfiaxnaczi_40-8-rgb_front what i have here is some nice bamboo
dxfiaxnaczi_41-8-rgb_front i have cut some bamboo sticks
dxfiaxnaczi_42-8-rgb_front and you can also use a bamboo stick with a little string or some wire
dxfiaxnaczi_43-8-rgb_front to hold your plant in place
dxfiaxnaczi_44-8-rgb_front now indoors or sometimes outdoors too
dxfiaxnaczi_45-8-rgb_front you can use a trellis
dxfiaxnaczi_46-8-rgb_front trellis is another great option
dxfiaxnaczi_47-8-rgb_front or another really great technique is to simply prop the plant up
dxfiaxnaczi_48-8-rgb_front so that it is leaning against the wall
dxfiaxnaczi_49-8-rgb_front sometimes if you just lean your plant up against the wall
dxfiaxnaczi_5-8-rgb_front but there are circumstances and there are types of plants
dxfiaxnaczi_50-8-rgb_front it provides some extra support
dxfiaxnaczi_51-8-rgb_front so basically these are some great techniques that you can use to anchor your plant
dxfiaxnaczi_6-8-rgb_front large and small
dxfiaxnaczi_7-8-rgb_front where you are going to have some problems with the plant
dxfiaxnaczi_8-8-rgb_front being in danger of falling over
dxfiaxnaczi_9-8-rgb_front but sometimes if a plant has a shallow root system
dxhtxnkvcda_0-5-rgb_front welcome
dxhtxnkvcda_1-5-rgb_front this section is called providing great customer service
dxhtxnkvcda_10-5-rgb_front so think of the value you will be receiving just from this one customer alone
dxhtxnkvcda_11-5-rgb_front again the bottom line for any business is profitability
dxhtxnkvcda_3-5-rgb_front so why is customer service so important to your business
dxhtxnkvcda_4-5-rgb_front every business is based upon customer
dxhtxnkvcda_5-5-rgb_front the customer is the person who brings revenue and profitability into your business
dxhtxnkvcda_6-5-rgb_front now if you lose this customer you are also losing the money or profitability that they brought in to you
dxhtxnkvcda_7-5-rgb_front if you retain customer is then you not only retain your business for a month a year but it could go on longer than that
dxhtxnkvcda_8-5-rgb_front think about the customer base that you could build upon from that one customer
dxhtxnkvcda_9-5-rgb_front you could have word of mouth advertising it is just out there for you if your customer is happy with you
dxk6yjzdmpi_1-11-rgb_front the next thing to do is just to slice up or chop up a white onion
dxk6yjzdmpi_10-11-rgb_front then the secret ingredient to this is going to be cilantro
dxk6yjzdmpi_11-11-rgb_front a cilantro is a interesting vegetable you got to really wash it well or you are going to find sand and grit in it so wash it and stem it
dxk6yjzdmpi_2-11-rgb_front i like to use a white onion because the color contrast is better
dxk6yjzdmpi_3-11-rgb_front the flavor is not that much different from a yellow onion to me it just looks better
dxk6yjzdmpi_4-11-rgb_front so that is why i use a white onion i already chopped it up and add maybe about a half of onion to this
dxk6yjzdmpi_5-11-rgb_front the next thing that i add is a chopped tomato now i used this is a regular tomato just a salad tomato
dxk6yjzdmpi_6-11-rgb_front i actually got an italian tomato
dxk6yjzdmpi_7-11-rgb_front those are plumb tomatoes i use those this time
dxk6yjzdmpi_8-11-rgb_front the reason is because they were redder fresher and they smell better
dxk6yjzdmpi_9-11-rgb_front whenever i get a tomato i always smell it to make sure that it has that tomato smell so we add all of this in
dy0raz2ubmu_0-8-rgb_front let is drill the basic double twist
dy0raz2ubmu_1-8-rgb_front shall we
dy0raz2ubmu_10-8-rgb_front feet are facing straight ahead belly button is pulled in chest is lifted
dy0raz2ubmu_11-8-rgb_front try this in front of a mirror and make sure you are doing the body positions correctly
dy0raz2ubmu_12-8-rgb_front good

dy0raz2ubmu_17-8-rgb_front forward back forward back left foot right foot left foot right foot left hip is keeping time now hands are not moving
dy0raz2ubmu_18-8-rgb_front keep the belly button pulled in chest lifted
dy0raz2ubmu_19-8-rgb_front good
dy0raz2ubmu_2-8-rgb_front so let is start with our single so think about the right hip going forward and then back forward and now keep all the weight on the right foot
dy0raz2ubmu_20-8-rgb_front slow it down one more time
dy0raz2ubmu_21-8-rgb_front and forward back forward back forward back
dy0raz2ubmu_22-8-rgb_front very nice
dy0raz2ubmu_3-8-rgb_front forward back then switch left foot back

dy0raz2ubmu_6-8-rgb_front five six double time
dy0raz2ubmu_7-8-rgb_front and forward back forward back forward back forward right foot left foot right foot left foot
dy0raz2ubmu_8-8-rgb_front notice the right hip is keeping time alright
dy0raz2ubmu_9-8-rgb_front hands stay in place they are not flying all around good
e-bhavb5n6i_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about how to find out about the educational requirements to take the certified public accountant exam
e-bhavb5n6i_1-8-rgb_front i am going to show you a website that will direct you to your state so that you can find out the individual requirements for the state you would like to be licensed in www nasba org is the website for the national association of state boards of accountancy
e-bhavb5n6i_2-8-rgb_front right on the homepage there is a listing for all of the state boards in the united states click on state board listings on the homepage it takes you to an in between page simply click on the left map which takes you to a map of the united states and all you have to do is click on your individual state
e-bhavb5n6i_3-8-rgb_front that will give you the name address phone number and fax number as well as an and a website for all the state boards of accountancy
e-bhavb5n6i_4-8-rgb_front each individual state have different requirements therefore it is important for you to find out the requirements for your individual state
e-bhavb5n6i_5-8-rgb_front and that is how you find out the educational requirements for the certified public accountants exam
e-pdvv4n-ue_0-5-rgb_front this is your plum line
e-pdvv4n-ue_1-5-rgb_front i picked this up at our local hardware store
e-pdvv4n-ue_10-5-rgb_front that way you will know that your finished product of your picket fence is level all the way down
e-pdvv4n-ue_2-5-rgb_front it is used to make sure that your is are square
e-pdvv4n-ue_3-5-rgb_front now how this works is that you put in your plum line
e-pdvv4n-ue_4-5-rgb_front this is where your fence is going to go
e-pdvv4n-ue_5-5-rgb_front the other function of a plum line is to tell you where your posts are going to go
e-pdvv4n-ue_6-5-rgb_front thirdly when you use your plum line make sure that this point on your post and this point on your post are touching equally the plum line
e-pdvv4n-ue_7-5-rgb_front we line up all your is in a straight line to make sure that they are all plum and when you put on your framing everything will be square for your picket fence
e-pdvv4n-ue_8-5-rgb_front another function of your plum line is to establish the height of your picket fence
e-pdvv4n-ue_9-5-rgb_front from one end to the other i put a level on it to make sure that this is level and when you are done with the framing of the fence we take our pickets and we attach the pickets to the frame to this height
e-yp10g7qdi_1-3-rgb_front i disk fired our bowl i am going to take it out now it is nice and hard
e-yp10g7qdi_10-3-rgb_front i do not know if you can see that
e-yp10g7qdi_11-3-rgb_front we have got a nice wax ring around there
e-yp10g7qdi_12-3-rgb_front that is good i am going to turn my pot
e-yp10g7qdi_13-3-rgb_front instead of starting where i left off i am going to come back here i am going to get more wax so you can see i am going to come back here where i started and pick that line up so i have a nice clean line come all the way over in here
e-yp10g7qdi_14-3-rgb_front that hole in there is so i can hang it up on the wall by the way
e-yp10g7qdi_15-3-rgb_front there we have waxed our bowl we are going to set it upside down like that
e-yp10g7qdi_16-3-rgb_front only takes a few minutes for it to dry
e-yp10g7qdi_2-3-rgb_front but it is still very porous
e-yp10g7qdi_3-3-rgb_front this is in the best shape for us to glaze our pot because the glaze is going to soak in there
e-yp10g7qdi_4-3-rgb_front but before we do that we want to wax our foot ring right here
e-yp10g7qdi_5-3-rgb_front we call it a foot because it sits on there right
e-yp10g7qdi_6-3-rgb_front we are going to take some liquid wax some cool stuff
e-yp10g7qdi_7-3-rgb_front we are going to start right in the center smear it around like this if you get to much on there as you tip it which we do not want to do as we tip it wax rolls off runs down the side glaze will not stick to there
e-yp10g7qdi_8-3-rgb_front since it did not do that we still have some wax in our sponge so i am going to go about a quarter of an inch at least slowly turn the pot turning my wrist both wrists like that all the way over
e-yp10g7qdi_9-3-rgb_front now we have a nice wax
e-njnp8kixa_1-5-rgb_front what we want to talk about now is running the pattern called the out route
e-njnp8kixa_10-5-rgb_front he is either going to give an inside jab step or a shank move and he is going to go to the outside he will open his body up looking back keeping the defensive back on the inside and he will get the pass to the outside
e-njnp8kixa_11-5-rgb_front one important thing is when he catches the ball on the out route he has to catch it tuck it turn and try to get up field as quick as possible if he has the defensive back
e-njnp8kixa_12-5-rgb_front a lot of times you will see the defensive back try to cheat it from the inside
e-njnp8kixa_13-5-rgb_front if he can make the catch and head up field he is going to have a guy on his back and that is a very effective route
e-njnp8kixa_14-5-rgb_front that is how to run the out route
e-njnp8kixa_2-5-rgb_front the out route can be very effective
e-njnp8kixa_3-5-rgb_front it is not a route you will run to pick up a lot of yardage
e-njnp8kixa_4-5-rgb_front if you have a defensive back that really cheats to the inside you want to try to run the outside route
e-njnp8kixa_5-5-rgb_front this is also a good route to use if you are trying to save time and trying to pick up yardage and stop the clock
e-njnp8kixa_6-5-rgb_front you can through him to the outside and get out of bounds to stop the clock
e-njnp8kixa_7-5-rgb_front this is what an out route looks like video demo
e-njnp8kixa_8-5-rgb_front we are going to have our receiver run about yards and get the defensive back in his back peddle
e-njnp8kixa_9-5-rgb_front then he is going to stop the route
e-zi5mlgq_u_0-8-rgb_front now we are able to lift the hoop up and off our body and put it back down
e-zi5mlgq_u_1-8-rgb_front let is try combining the
e-zi5mlgq_u_10-8-rgb_front do rotations and then the right hand will put it back down or your first hand
e-zi5mlgq_u_11-8-rgb_front lift up and back down
e-zi5mlgq_u_12-8-rgb_front nice
e-zi5mlgq_u_13-8-rgb_front let is try that again
e-zi5mlgq_u_14-8-rgb_front lifting up
e-zi5mlgq_u_15-8-rgb_front and back down
e-zi5mlgq_u_16-8-rgb_front you can really have some fun with putting the hoop down by extending that second arm through the hoop turning slowly and then giving the hoop a whirl
e-zi5mlgq_u_17-8-rgb_front if you would like you can do that quick
e-zi5mlgq_u_18-8-rgb_front up down up down
e-zi5mlgq_u_19-8-rgb_front lift ups and drop downs are a lot of fun so play with them and make this trick your own
e-zi5mlgq_u_2-8-rgb_front take your first hand or right hand in my instance because i hoop to the left
e-zi5mlgq_u_3-8-rgb_front take your first hand place it on the small of your back
e-zi5mlgq_u_4-8-rgb_front when you feel that hoop hit your hand you are going to lift up into lasso
e-zi5mlgq_u_5-8-rgb_front now i am going to bring it back down using my first hand as well
e-zi5mlgq_u_6-8-rgb_front when i see that opening i can either stick my second hand up and into it or i can just place it down on the body
e-zi5mlgq_u_7-8-rgb_front once again and then slowly bring it back down
e-zi5mlgq_u_8-8-rgb_front let is do it a little bit more smoothly now
e-zi5mlgq_u_9-8-rgb_front right hand is going to lift up
e29upl981zq_0-1-rgb_front the last snake we are going to look at today is the sand boa
e29upl981zq_1-1-rgb_front this is an anytheristic sand boa meaning it lacks the red pigmentation
e29upl981zq_10-1-rgb_front it is what we like to call shovel head so it is flat on the bottom here and it goes slightly inclined up to the top and that is to help them burrow down
e29upl981zq_11-1-rgb_front if you ever see them in action they really do they just slide right in the dirt like it is water and disappear right away
e29upl981zq_12-1-rgb_front these guys max out at about two to three feet
e29upl981zq_13-1-rgb_front they do not get very big
e29upl981zq_14-1-rgb_front they stay nice and small
e29upl981zq_15-1-rgb_front they are usually pretty well mannered as well
e29upl981zq_16-1-rgb_front they are easy to keep
e29upl981zq_17-1-rgb_front they are a desert species living in a sandy dirt kind of substrate
e29upl981zq_18-1-rgb_front you can see he is sniffing around with his little tongue checking everything out making sure that there is nothing that is going to eat him or that he can eat
e29upl981zq_19-1-rgb_front this is a pretty typical patterning for a sand boa
e29upl981zq_2-1-rgb_front that is why it is a black and white sand boa
e29upl981zq_20-1-rgb_front blotches of black and the coloration between
e29upl981zq_21-1-rgb_front the splotches can be bigger or smaller depending on the sand boa
e29upl981zq_22-1-rgb_front sometimes you get a little bit of banding though it is relatively rare
e29upl981zq_23-1-rgb_front there are a couple of different species of sand boas
e29upl981zq_24-1-rgb_front there is tanzanian sand boas kenyan sand boas rough scaled sand boas
e29upl981zq_25-1-rgb_front so not all sand boas are the same
e29upl981zq_26-1-rgb_front there is various differences between the species such as eye placement shape and feel of the scales and things like that but more often than not what you will see in a pet store is going to be a kenyan sand boa because that is the most popular species and most readily available
e29upl981zq_3-1-rgb_front usually they are an orangish red and black
e29upl981zq_4-1-rgb_front this is a female sand boa
e29upl981zq_5-1-rgb_front sand boas are one of the few snakes where you can actually tell the sex by dimorphism which means they have both sexes have different characteristics
e29upl981zq_6-1-rgb_front the sand boas the females have a much shorter fatter tail than the males do
e29upl981zq_7-1-rgb_front the males have a longer tail section
e29upl981zq_8-1-rgb_front interesting things about the sand boas the sand boas do live most of their lives underground
e29upl981zq_9-1-rgb_front if you look at the shape of the head it has an incline on it
e3r2mqix7uo_0-5-rgb_front let is talk about the dice that are used for craps
e3r2mqix7uo_1-5-rgb_front just to make sure that everybody is up to snuff on the situation
e3r2mqix7uo_10-5-rgb_front two identical dice right and the object is to roll them both at the same time
e3r2mqix7uo_11-5-rgb_front that is the action that you do and you let rolling the dice or rolling the bones decide your fate if you will and that there you have it
e3r2mqix7uo_12-5-rgb_front there is six plus four equals ten so the whole deal is you are playing with two six sided dice and probability is at play and the thing the combination the sum that most often comes up will be seven because it is most likely with two six sided dice to get a seven than anything else
e3r2mqix7uo_13-5-rgb_front essentially that is what is at play in craps
e3r2mqix7uo_2-5-rgb_front you got two six sided dice
e3r2mqix7uo_3-5-rgb_front let is look at one of them
e3r2mqix7uo_4-5-rgb_front there is a one
e3r2mqix7uo_5-5-rgb_front two dots so that is two
e3r2mqix7uo_6-5-rgb_front there is three
e3r2mqix7uo_7-5-rgb_front four
e3r2mqix7uo_8-5-rgb_front five and then six
e3r2mqix7uo_9-5-rgb_front and you have got two of these dice
e4dmo7t5pbi_0-8-rgb_front i am dr joe neely
e4dmo7t5pbi_1-8-rgb_front i practice with the barton oaks dental group
e4dmo7t5pbi_10-8-rgb_front but typically if you wait long enough if you are able to wait long enough the body will either vent the abscess tooth the infection up along the ligament that holds the tooth in to the outside or actually create a little tunnel a channel to the outside
e4dmo7t5pbi_11-8-rgb_front the infection is still there it just has a way of relieving pressure
e4dmo7t5pbi_12-8-rgb_front now the abscess is only painful if you bite hard on it or if your if you become infirmed enough that your normal immune system does not attack it
e4dmo7t5pbi_13-8-rgb_front at that point in time the infection can continue to become more and more virulent or strong potent toxic
e4dmo7t5pbi_14-8-rgb_front it will literally eat away honey comb the tooth surface
e4dmo7t5pbi_15-8-rgb_front so after the infection has been removed through antibiotics and a root canal is done the infected portion of your tooth removed if the infection has been there long enough and the surface of the tooth is enough like a honey comb porous it is necessary to go in and do surgery to cut that off
e4dmo7t5pbi_16-8-rgb_front simply said you avoid a tooth abscess by treating it in a timely fashion
e4dmo7t5pbi_2-8-rgb_front i want to talk about how to avoid surgery for an apical toot abscess
e4dmo7t5pbi_3-8-rgb_front the apex of the tooth or the apical portion of the tooth is the tip of the root
e4dmo7t5pbi_4-8-rgb_front if you could imagine this ball point pen being a tooth
e4dmo7t5pbi_5-8-rgb_front the crown or the coronal portion is the portion that you normally see in your mouth and the very tip of the root where the small aperture is that the blood vessels and nerves enter the tooth is called the apex of the tooth
e4dmo7t5pbi_6-8-rgb_front so surgery is avoided surgery is done at the apex of the tooth for one of several reasons
e4dmo7t5pbi_7-8-rgb_front one if the abscess is allowed to continued to mature to the point that the bodies immune system and even systemic antibiotics can not control the infection then there are times where you have to go in from the outside reflect the gum back bore a hole through the bone into the abscessed area in order to relieve enough of the fluid in order to begin to be able to overwhelm the infection
e4dmo7t5pbi_8-8-rgb_front that type of abscess surgery is avoided by getting the abscess or the tooth infection treated rather than waiting
e4dmo7t5pbi_9-8-rgb_front the early portion of an abscess tooth is quite uncomfortable there is a lot of pain from the intense pressure
e5dprjl6aga_0-8-rgb_front in this section i am going to show you how to iron the wax over the snowboard
e5dprjl6aga_1-8-rgb_front what you are going to want to do when you start waxing is you are going to want to take your iron and hold it above the snowboard and touch it with your bar of wax and your wax will begin to drip off
e5dprjl6aga_2-8-rgb_front and you are just going to want to make a steady stream of dots or lines and zig zag across the board
e5dprjl6aga_3-8-rgb_front make sure you get quite a bit of wax on there then if your iron starts to smoke turn it down a little
e5dprjl6aga_4-8-rgb_front and then what you are going to do is you are going to take the iron and melt all this wax down into the base
e5dprjl6aga_5-8-rgb_front after you drip your wax over your snowboard you are going to want to take your iron and just press pretty hard down and iron all of that dripped wax down evenly over your entire base leaving it on as the spots dry
e5dprjl6aga_6-8-rgb_front after you iron on some of the new wax you will see some of the dirty wax that you could not get off initially come up to the top and then you will get that all off later once you scrape off all the excess
e5cov1szckg_1-3-rgb_front now going to lower the car
e5cov1szckg_2-3-rgb_front important to pick this car up by the frame because you can damage the car
e5cov1szckg_3-3-rgb_front this happens to be a front wheel drive car if you pick up under the axles going to damage those axles
e5cov1szckg_4-3-rgb_front important to raise the car high enough so the stand clear is easily
e5cov1szckg_5-3-rgb_front this way you have a chance of the stand jamming and a chance of the jack slipping off the car
e5cov1szckg_6-3-rgb_front okay going to let the car down slowly
e5cov1szckg_7-3-rgb_front now going to do the same thing on the other side
e5cov1szckg_8-3-rgb_front how we lower a car
e6cnf4sezc0_0-8-rgb_front hi i am ty brown with dogbehavioronline com
e6cnf4sezc0_1-8-rgb_front i am here in riverton utah today teaching you how to train a dog
e6cnf4sezc0_10-8-rgb_front give the dog is name and then the command
e6cnf4sezc0_11-8-rgb_front and then immediately following the command just a little tug on the leash as you trot backwards
e6cnf4sezc0_12-8-rgb_front you trotting backwards is going to give that dog a bit of a target to go to
e6cnf4sezc0_13-8-rgb_front and the second he comes to you you are going to praise him heavily and make him feel very good about what he is done
e6cnf4sezc0_14-8-rgb_front do this with a lot of repetition
e6cnf4sezc0_15-8-rgb_front and now you do not have to tug very hard but we just want something physical associated with that word come
e6cnf4sezc0_16-8-rgb_front now if you do this a thousand times let is say time number one thousand and one now you do not have the leash on you give the command
e6cnf4sezc0_17-8-rgb_front rocko come
e6cnf4sezc0_18-8-rgb_front and sure enough because you have done it so many times it is into the dog is head and even without the leash here he comes
e6cnf4sezc0_19-8-rgb_front and he comes running
e6cnf4sezc0_2-8-rgb_front the topic of today is discussion is teaching your dog how to come when called
e6cnf4sezc0_20-8-rgb_front so using these techniques is what is going to teach your dog how to come when called
e6cnf4sezc0_3-8-rgb_front now one of the most frustrating things that dog owner complain to me about is that their dogs do not come when called
e6cnf4sezc0_4-8-rgb_front and so it is really important not only to have a dog that does not run away but to have a dog that can come in a time that maybe car is coming or something like that
e6cnf4sezc0_5-8-rgb_front it is important that the dog comes when called
e6cnf4sezc0_6-8-rgb_front and so the tool that you are going to need is what is called a
e6cnf4sezc0_7-8-rgb_front now a is just a foot leash typically made out of cotton
e6cnf4sezc0_8-8-rgb_front what you are going to want to do is get your dog away from you
e6cnf4sezc0_9-8-rgb_front maybe feet
e6lt9dk8hts_0-8-rgb_front now if we are talking about putting a hat away for a season if necessary it is perfectly acceptable to take a hat like this pack it wrap it in a little dry cleaning plastic and gently put it into the top of a closet like so but over time that is not ideal it will start to chaff the hat
e6lt9dk8hts_1-8-rgb_front i strongly recommend that you invest in a hat box
e6lt9dk8hts_2-8-rgb_front almost every hat store in the country sells hat boxes
e6lt9dk8hts_3-8-rgb_front they are typically very inexpensive in the to dollar range but by comparison a good felt hat for those of you who do not know is going to run you anywhere from to dollars so if you want a hat like this a good hat box is a tremendous investment
e6lt9dk8hts_4-8-rgb_front the main component of a real hat box and there are people who sell plain boxes to be used as hat boxes is this insert which holds the crown of the hat and puts the weight right around the band and i will demonstrate like so
e6lt9dk8hts_5-8-rgb_front and you can see that this hat is now completely secure no weight is really on any part of it except the reinforced area around the stitching where it is not going to lose shape the brim is completely protected from distortion and the lid protects the entire hat from dust
e7mog6eolu4_1-5-rgb_front we fried tempura and now we are going to do a breaded and a coconut shrimp and here is how we do it
e7mog6eolu4_2-5-rgb_front okay first we take a shrimp we stick it into the eggs they have already been scramble
e7mog6eolu4_3-5-rgb_front i use the yolk and the white and then i am going to stick a little flour on it and i am going to stick it the egg a little bit again just to it and then i am going to put some breading on there
e7mog6eolu4_4-5-rgb_front and we would do a couple of these to show you this style and then we get them into the deep fryer in a minute and see what happens from there
e7mog6eolu4_5-5-rgb_front okay this is with just straight breading in another segment we will be showing you how to do coconut shrimp
e7mog6eolu4_6-5-rgb_front alright i think these are finished now i am going to go ahead and take these out
e7mog6eolu4_7-5-rgb_front oh ya they are nice and brown they have been in there minutes it all depends on your time frame is to how many shrimp you have how much breading what type of fryer you have and here we have the finish product
e7mog6eolu4_8-5-rgb_front these are breaded shrimp the next one you see in the next segment is coconut shrimp
e9l9mijxdum_1-5-rgb_front we are still talking about interceptions
e9l9mijxdum_10-5-rgb_front you want to attack the ball
e9l9mijxdum_11-5-rgb_front in order to do that you have to set you have to have a good base then jump up as high as you can and meet that ball at it is highest point
e9l9mijxdum_12-5-rgb_front do not let the ball come down to you
e9l9mijxdum_13-5-rgb_front the other thing to make sure you do not do is if i am in a jump ball situation with this guy i can not push him out of the way when i jump up to get the ball
e9l9mijxdum_14-5-rgb_front that is called interference
e9l9mijxdum_15-5-rgb_front the other thing i can not do is as i am going up i can not hold his hands down from catching the ball
e9l9mijxdum_16-5-rgb_front it has to be an even jump ball situation where i go up for it
e9l9mijxdum_17-5-rgb_front so this is our defensive guy here is our wide receiver and they are going to go out for a few yards and show you what it looks like in a jump ball situation video demo
e9l9mijxdum_18-5-rgb_front in that jump ball situation both of them had just as much right to go up and get the ball as the other one
e9l9mijxdum_19-5-rgb_front they did not interfere with the pass and they met the ball at the highest point
e9l9mijxdum_2-5-rgb_front one thing that is important is when you are trying to make an interception you have to have a good read on the ball
e9l9mijxdum_20-5-rgb_front then it is the best guy comes down with it
e9l9mijxdum_21-5-rgb_front that is the way we do not interfere and we go up and meet the ball at the highest point when trying to intercept the ball
e9l9mijxdum_3_4-5-rgb_front especially if you have either a big receiver or a big defensive back one thing that will come into play is a jump ball situation when making an interception
e9l9mijxdum_5_6-5-rgb_front especially if you have read the pass and the quarterback throws it a little under then you will have a jump ball situation
e9l9mijxdum_7-5-rgb_front there are two things we want to remember
e9l9mijxdum_8-5-rgb_front first we always want to meet the ball at it is highest point
e9l9mijxdum_9-5-rgb_front we talked about in a previous clip that you do not want to let the ball come to you
ea5ttaqpj9w_10-4-rgb_front ball comes down goes here alright this is a trap situation between those two players
ea5ttaqpj9w_11-4-rgb_front same thing ball goes here trap trap here between these two guys alright
ea5ttaqpj9w_12-4-rgb_front some reason ball gets to the corner this guy is got to fly to get there and this guy is got to cut off the base line and any penetration there
ea5ttaqpj9w_13-4-rgb_front this guy is flying here alright and this guy is got the back side ok now the vulnerable part of this is if for some how they skip the pass all the way over to here then these guys have to fly to get there
ea5ttaqpj9w_14-4-rgb_front this guy is base line to base line on both sides free throw foul line extended
ea5ttaqpj9w_15-4-rgb_front he is got to get there alright so if the ball is here this guy is flying this guy is flying this guy is here this guy is here this guy is here
ea5ttaqpj9w_16-4-rgb_front quick ball reversal will really hurt this defense
ea5ttaqpj9w_17-4-rgb_front so everyone is got to be aware locked in to their situation knowing and anticipating first of all that the interior is very weak here
ea5ttaqpj9w_18-4-rgb_front you have only got one guy here at the free throw line and one guy underneath
ea5ttaqpj9w_19-4-rgb_front this defense is designed to stop the outside shot
ea5ttaqpj9w_20-4-rgb_front from corner to corner right foul line extended out i am sorry foul lane extended this way and free throw line extended this way these guys have to be flying alright
ea5ttaqpj9w_21-4-rgb_front so again ball goes to the corner this guy is flying here this guy is flying here
ea5ttaqpj9w_22-4-rgb_front ball reverses this guy is flying here this guy is flying here he is dropping here he is dropping here
ea5ttaqpj9w_23-4-rgb_front anything on the top these two players have to be able to shut it down
ea5ttaqpj9w_24-4-rgb_front alright so anything from here to here has to be shut down and this guy is got to be so big in here we can not allow anything in here alright
ea5ttaqpj9w_25-4-rgb_front these two guys have to shut all of this down and this guy is got to shut this down this guy is got to shut this down
ea5ttaqpj9w_26-4-rgb_front so the weak spots are here and here
ea5ttaqpj9w_27-4-rgb_front got to be aware of that when you are playing a
ea5ttaqpj9w_28-4-rgb_front if you are playing against a team that can shoot it well from outside is what you want to run
ea5ttaqpj9w_7-4-rgb_front now you have to have athletes in order to really run this defense
ea5ttaqpj9w_8-4-rgb_front it is really really important
ea5ttaqpj9w_9-4-rgb_front alright here is what i mean by that
ebc1o6yzcoq_0-5-rgb_front another reason that you would like to work on your horse and why your horse might like you to work on them is to help them feel more comfortable with their areas of structural imbalance
ebc1o6yzcoq_1-5-rgb_front most horses are not conformationally perfect
ebc1o6yzcoq_2-5-rgb_front if you have a horse that toes out a little bit for instance or toes in a little bit a horse that has a little bit of a sway back a horse that has a really heavy neck that is going to show up in other parts of their body
ebc1o6yzcoq_3-5-rgb_front if the horse toes out they are going to have some definite strains in this area
ebc1o6yzcoq_4-5-rgb_front their muscles are going to be tight
ebc1o6yzcoq_5-5-rgb_front or if the horse toes in any of those structural imbalances are going to cause issues
ebc1o6yzcoq_6-5-rgb_front if they have a very heavy neck or if their neck ties in in a specific way they are used to be used to carrying their body in a such a way as to perhaps protect the neck area to guard it a little bit
ebc1o6yzcoq_7-5-rgb_front or they are going to be used to balancing with their neck a great deal which is going to cause issues along the back area and in the hindquarters
ebmoqaca2te_0-8-rgb_front hi
ebmoqaca2te_1-8-rgb_front this is john stewart and this how to set up your ground tarp or your footprint for setting up your tent
ebmoqaca2te_10-8-rgb_front so with your ground cloths you always want to make sure you have them trimmed to the size of the bottom of your tent to where your tent sits right over the top of it
ebmoqaca2te_11-8-rgb_front this is how to set up a ground cloth or footprint for setting a tent
ebmoqaca2te_2-8-rgb_front most tents now days come with a footprint or a ground cloth
ebmoqaca2te_3-8-rgb_front these help for protecting the bottom of the tent from moisture sharp objects stumps roots and other things
ebmoqaca2te_4-8-rgb_front most footprints come fitted to the bottom of the tent so that there is no overhang on the outside of the tent when you set the tent on top of it
ebmoqaca2te_5-8-rgb_front these are real nice because you do not have to do any folding of the ground cloth or anything like that
ebmoqaca2te_6-8-rgb_front ground cloths can be tarps tyvec plastic sheeting anything like that that you can put on the ground to be a base layer to protect the bottom of your tent from moisture and other objects
ebmoqaca2te_7-8-rgb_front these things need to trimmed to the size of the bottom of your tent so that the water does not catch if it rains and flow up under your tent and pull up
ebmoqaca2te_8-8-rgb_front if the water pulls up underneath your tent
ebmoqaca2te_9-8-rgb_front it can saturate through and come into your tent in the middle of the night
ed008vqmdju_0-3-rgb_front ok
ed008vqmdju_1-3-rgb_front the next thing i want to talk to you about is silence
ed008vqmdju_10-3-rgb_front no i would rather be silent and punish you than tell you how i am really feeling or thinking
ed008vqmdju_11-3-rgb_front the silent treatment is a way in which we communicate
ed008vqmdju_12-3-rgb_front it communicates that we do not want to communicate
ed008vqmdju_13-3-rgb_front i cannot encourage you enough not to give people the silent treatment
ed008vqmdju_14-3-rgb_front and i have known a lot of people i have worked with a lot of people in my life that love the silent treatment
ed008vqmdju_15-3-rgb_front they love for you to have to figure out what it is that you are upset about
ed008vqmdju_16-3-rgb_front and that is really really bad in communication
ed008vqmdju_17-3-rgb_front it is one of the worst tools that you can pick up and use
ed008vqmdju_18-3-rgb_front so stop using the silent treatment and start encouraging yourself to use words which is verbal communication to communicate how you feel
ed008vqmdju_2-3-rgb_front yep that was silent
ed008vqmdju_3-3-rgb_front and what does that communicate
ed008vqmdju_4-3-rgb_front nothing
ed008vqmdju_5-3-rgb_front nothing
ed008vqmdju_6-3-rgb_front have you ever heard of or given or received the silent treatment
ed008vqmdju_7-3-rgb_front ah we see it in relationships a whole lot
ed008vqmdju_8-3-rgb_front and what the silent treatment is something like this
ed008vqmdju_9-3-rgb_front so do you want to talk about it
ed0ddlxjmfq_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we will talk a little bit more how to use our handkerchiefs
ed0ddlxjmfq_1-8-rgb_front you can use one or two
ed0ddlxjmfq_10-8-rgb_front and one two three one two three because the movement of the arms is continuous there is no rhythm in it
ed0ddlxjmfq_11-8-rgb_front one two three one two three one two three one two three
ed0ddlxjmfq_2-8-rgb_front it depends of the decision or the mood or the master technique also
ed0ddlxjmfq_3-8-rgb_front so the rotation again uses the same cycle of one two three one two three one two three
ed0ddlxjmfq_4-8-rgb_front going outward to concentric circles or inward one two three one two three one two three one two three
ed0ddlxjmfq_5-8-rgb_front or one two three one two three one two three
ed0ddlxjmfq_6-8-rgb_front again rising and falling
ed0ddlxjmfq_7-8-rgb_front one two three one two three one two three one two three
ed0ddlxjmfq_8-8-rgb_front it is very similar to the movement of the hands from rising up and one hand or two hands
ed0ddlxjmfq_9-8-rgb_front but it is a little bit difficult to combine the basic step with the movement of the arms
edx0bo4enhc_1-8-rgb_front what i am going to do now is place the window in the opening
edx0bo4enhc_2-8-rgb_front this is the right replacement
edx0bo4enhc_3-8-rgb_front since i have a top stop i just want to hold my window in it is a sloping ceil just set the window on the outer edge
edx0bo4enhc_4-8-rgb_front what that does it lowers my window and allows my window to drop in then i push my bottom in and now the window is held by the top stop and i can let go of it
edx0bo4enhc_5-8-rgb_front then what i do next is to take shim boards all the way to the far corner
edx0bo4enhc_6-8-rgb_front if you do not go to the far corner what is going to happen is that it is going to bow your ceil and that is a no no
edx0bo4enhc_7-8-rgb_front i go to the far side jack my window up and what this does is it brings my window all the way solid to the top
edx0bo4enhc_8-8-rgb_front now i can insulate my window
edwjk7w45lo_1-8-rgb_front and that would be the letter i
edwjk7w45lo_10-8-rgb_front i will just point out this one
edwjk7w45lo_11-8-rgb_front this is an i which is fairly plain
edwjk7w45lo_12-8-rgb_front it is unadorned
edwjk7w45lo_13-8-rgb_front it is particularly more confident when you have also the upper and lower bands on it and by contrast this one here would indicate a low if you are doing a little i meaning yourself
edwjk7w45lo_14-8-rgb_front and then all those other i is have different meanings too
edwjk7w45lo_15-8-rgb_front but you can basically from what you now know about handwriting you can figure out that things like the size and the form of the i whether it is very ornate whether it is very plain that all responds to the i as well
edwjk7w45lo_2-8-rgb_front because i represents your self image
edwjk7w45lo_3-8-rgb_front what do you think of yourself
edwjk7w45lo_4-8-rgb_front how big is your ego in other words
edwjk7w45lo_5-8-rgb_front ok so there are many different ways in which we can write that letter i and it indicates how we feel about ourselves
edwjk7w45lo_6-8-rgb_front so there are many representations of that letter i on this sheet
edwjk7w45lo_7-8-rgb_front as you can see there are various different types of ways in which you can writes that letter i
edwjk7w45lo_8-8-rgb_front see if you can find the way which you write the letter i on this sheet
edwjk7w45lo_9-8-rgb_front so i am not going to go over every single one
eemljp2s3sg_1-11-rgb_front once you rolled out your pie crust take a spatula and just kind of work it under it cause you do not want to tear it
eemljp2s3sg_10-11-rgb_front place it like this then it is not quite high enough just go ahead and take a little scrap piece and push it back in there
eemljp2s3sg_11-11-rgb_front it is really easy to add and take away pieces for one area into the other area just fine and once you done that just go ahead and trim it off like such
eemljp2s3sg_2-11-rgb_front if it is stuck anywhere from underneath non commercial surface and it would be hard to get off
eemljp2s3sg_3-11-rgb_front so obviously i can not go all the way to the middle but to move it to our pie pan
eemljp2s3sg_4-11-rgb_front we are just going to flop it this over anyway like a burrito
eemljp2s3sg_5-11-rgb_front so now we can get to the middle and we can roll it again this just makes it easier to transfer to our pie pan
eemljp2s3sg_6-11-rgb_front then transfer it and roll it gently back out the really good part about making pie crust is that pie crust taste really good raw and you always have little scrap pieces like this you can eat
eemljp2s3sg_7-11-rgb_front so take advantage of that do not let your kids see you do that my grandmother use to say you get worms if you do that
eemljp2s3sg_8-11-rgb_front anyway and there you go you just trim it and decorate it and then your ready to put your pie filling in
eemljp2s3sg_9-11-rgb_front to trim the edges you just take a regular pairing knife and just that really just works good if you go like that and it comes off just dandy
ef3ouyjt6pe_1-3-rgb_front and the dealer has his cards and your going to place your bet because a pair kings is a very good hand to have and you see the dealer also has a pair of kings so your thinking now what are we going to do cause everybody has a pair of kings were going to the card since you have a queen and the dealer has a you are the winner so your going to win your ante your going to win your bet and your also going to win your pair plus because you do have a pair of kings
ef3ouyjt6pe_2-3-rgb_front and we will talk about the amount you just won a little bit later
ef3ouyjt6pe_3-3-rgb_front thank you for watching
ef4dlnqkj3w_0-8-rgb_front so we are going to start with how to slip or dodge a punch
ef4dlnqkj3w_1-8-rgb_front as you know for fighting sparring any situation defending yourself
ef4dlnqkj3w_10-8-rgb_front o k
ef4dlnqkj3w_11-8-rgb_front if you look at the floor and you come up you do not know what is waiting for you as you come up
ef4dlnqkj3w_12-8-rgb_front so anytime somebody is throwing a punch at you
ef4dlnqkj3w_13-8-rgb_front and you are trying to get away from it
ef4dlnqkj3w_14-8-rgb_front you want to still keep your eyes on your opponent as you are going underneath that punch
ef4dlnqkj3w_15_16_17-8-rgb_front o k so pretend just straight punch is coming at you you want to go underneath it at the same time protect your face and your rib cage
ef4dlnqkj3w_18-8-rgb_front you just went from right to left
ef4dlnqkj3w_19-8-rgb_front and we just went underneath that punch making half a circle
ef4dlnqkj3w_2-8-rgb_front there maybe that the person is hitting you back
ef4dlnqkj3w_20-8-rgb_front so one more time step over and under
ef4dlnqkj3w_21-8-rgb_front and come up on the other side
ef4dlnqkj3w_22-8-rgb_front o k
ef4dlnqkj3w_23-8-rgb_front make sure you do not look at the floor this whole time
ef4dlnqkj3w_24-8-rgb_front and that your hands stay up
ef4dlnqkj3w_25-8-rgb_front keep your eyes on your opponent the whole time you are moving underneath that arm or that punch to make sure you know what is coming at you
ef4dlnqkj3w_26-8-rgb_front the second you get up from that slip
ef4dlnqkj3w_27-8-rgb_front now you can do two of them
ef4dlnqkj3w_29-8-rgb_front you can slip underneath
ef4dlnqkj3w_3-8-rgb_front so how do you get away from that
ef4dlnqkj3w_30-8-rgb_front if another punch is coming
ef4dlnqkj3w_31-8-rgb_front or moving back
ef4dlnqkj3w_32-8-rgb_front o k so that is two slips
ef4dlnqkj3w_33-8-rgb_front one and two
ef4dlnqkj3w_34-8-rgb_front get ready to throw a punch
ef4dlnqkj3w_35-8-rgb_front right after you come out of that slip
ef4dlnqkj3w_36-8-rgb_front next we are going to work on simple combinations starting with jab cross
ef4dlnqkj3w_4-8-rgb_front well you have got to learn how to slip
ef4dlnqkj3w_5-8-rgb_front so again you have to start with the staggered stance
ef4dlnqkj3w_6-8-rgb_front so you have balance
ef4dlnqkj3w_7-8-rgb_front make sure you have the hip width apart same position that you set up for a punch
ef4dlnqkj3w_8-8-rgb_front hands are always up
ef4dlnqkj3w_9-8-rgb_front the most common mistake people make slipping is they look at the floor as they go down
efaag-4wi58_0_1-2-rgb_front my name is windy st george and this is how to play uno uno is a card game similar to crazy eights
efaag-4wi58_10-2-rgb_front sometimes the person who is first out is not the one who wins
efaag-4wi58_11-2-rgb_front the strategy cards are worth more points than the regular numbered cards so once the cards have been dealt the first card on top of the draw pile is turned over and this one here is a and yellow so the person to the left of the dealer can play either a or a yellow card that they have in their hand or special cards
efaag-4wi58_12-2-rgb_front a wild card can be played on any card and any number
efaag-4wi58_13-2-rgb_front i have here a yellow card so this turn goes to the left and the player either plays specialty cards or a card that matches either a color or the number
efaag-4wi58_14-2-rgb_front if the player does not have a card that they can play or they have a card they do not want to play but they could play they instead draw a card and you do not want to draw too many cards because the goal is to get the cards out of your hands but it is sometimes strategic to draw another card
efaag-4wi58_15-2-rgb_front when people are playing and you get down to the last card in your hand and you have only one card left you must shout uno so that everyone is aware that the game is about to be over
efaag-4wi58_16-2-rgb_front if you do not remember to shout uno and you are caught with one card in your hand you must draw two cards and that is how you play uno
efaag-4wi58_2-2-rgb_front it plays two to ten players
efaag-4wi58_3-2-rgb_front one person will be the dealer and the dealer will deal out seven cards to each player
efaag-4wi58_4-2-rgb_front there are different kinds of cards in uno
efaag-4wi58_5-2-rgb_front there are regular number cards which is the basic card that you are going to have and then there are special cards that change the turn order
efaag-4wi58_6-2-rgb_front wild cards are allowed to play any time
efaag-4wi58_7-2-rgb_front there are draw two cards to play this and draw two cards instead of placing your card down
efaag-4wi58_8-2-rgb_front there is skip a turn which causes the next person to lose their turn and then there is reverse which causes the turn order to go counter clockwise
efaag-4wi58_9-2-rgb_front so the goal of uno is to be the first to have all your cards out of your hand and to have the most points afterwards
eguntffr99y_0-8-rgb_front hello my name is adrian arceo and now we are going to get into some first and third base coaching
eguntffr99y_1-8-rgb_front now do not think that just because you are not between those two white lines that you are not an important part of the offense because even the smartest base runners needs help getting around the bases
eguntffr99y_10-8-rgb_front so do not be fooled being a first and third base coach is actually very important
eguntffr99y_2-8-rgb_front now as a first base coach or a third base coach you have to be smart you have to have a lot of experience you have to make split second decisions and know the capabilities of not only the players on your team but the players on the other team
eguntffr99y_3-8-rgb_front now between the first and third base coaches there is actually a lot of communication going on but each individual coach has different responsibilities
eguntffr99y_4-8-rgb_front usually the first base coach is responsible for the runner between home and first base
eguntffr99y_5-8-rgb_front as soon as the runner starts heading out to second base the responsibility gets handed onto the third base coach
eguntffr99y_6-8-rgb_front now as a base coach you have to respond to differences in outs counts innings players situations and game intensity
eguntffr99y_7-8-rgb_front so there is a lot to go into when it comes to coaching third and first base
eguntffr99y_8-8-rgb_front and just as in a game when an umpire makes a bad call it can change the entire outcome of the game
eguntffr99y_9-8-rgb_front a bad decision or a bad call by the first or third base coaches can actually change the entire game completely
ei6dnhovn40_0-8-rgb_front so your snake is done it looks great so now where to display it
ei6dnhovn40_1-8-rgb_front you are probably pretty proud of your snake so it could go anywhere it could go on a table on a shelf but there are a couple of other places which would be kind of cool to display as well
ei6dnhovn40_2-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that your snake is really dry before you put it anywhere
ei6dnhovn40_3-8-rgb_front i am going to show you how you could actually hang your snake on the wall
ei6dnhovn40_4-8-rgb_front if you have got a few tacks what you can do is place your snake along this way and this snake is really dry otherwise we would not be putting it on the wall and you can push the tacks in and because this is newspaper you can either grab on to the newspaper or you can push it in where the bends are so actually it makes a great decoration in a kids room and you can see that there and it stays against the wall it is like a three dimensional piece of art
ei6dnhovn40_5-8-rgb_front if you do not want to put it on the wall on a shelf on a table you can also hang it
ei6dnhovn40_6-8-rgb_front you can hang it using string colorful string wire and hang it from the ceiling
eipx6dcsgfa_0-5-rgb_front now going to show you about dealing the cards going to always start from the left going to the right player
eipx6dcsgfa_1-5-rgb_front so here this is how it goes
eipx6dcsgfa_10-5-rgb_front again dealing up up up dealer card up up up up and in this case the next card i put is down or called the hole card and again slide into the table so nobody can see and put it under
eipx6dcsgfa_11-5-rgb_front just a slight difference but you might be able to do it that way too
eipx6dcsgfa_2-5-rgb_front put a few hands out one another two another three
eipx6dcsgfa_3-5-rgb_front now going to deal to myself going to put this card down to the dealer
eipx6dcsgfa_4-5-rgb_front the next card is up what i do is put it toward the right of the card why
eipx6dcsgfa_5-5-rgb_front because you can see both cards easily the numerical value easy to read for the dealer and the player
eipx6dcsgfa_6-5-rgb_front put the next card up the next card up and the card up
eipx6dcsgfa_7-5-rgb_front again dealing goes left to right and this order
eipx6dcsgfa_8-5-rgb_front and then i get my last card
eipx6dcsgfa_9-5-rgb_front another way you can do this just a simple slight difference would be this
elyvp7c91yu_1-8-rgb_front so as you can see our crab cakes mixture is all well blended and now we are going to form the crab cakes itself
elyvp7c91yu_2-8-rgb_front okay i like to take a table spoon and kind of gather the crab meat mixture in the spoon like that and just form it into a patty
elyvp7c91yu_3-8-rgb_front nice like that see basically the size of the crab cakes you just do that to the whole mixture here and then we are going to put it in the refrigerator and then go on to complete the receipt and do our crab sauce
elyvp7c91yu_4-8-rgb_front okay yes there we go and we like to make it pretty much the same size

eljazrkpx0s_8-5-rgb_front everywhere that you say that something is labeled red means that there is a function on this particular stroller
eljazrkpx0s_9-5-rgb_front this is about pounds in weight for this particular umbrella stroller
emi4hyw42fs_0-5-rgb_front now let is talk a little about middle activities or medium activities which are basically teaching a concept
emi4hyw42fs_1-5-rgb_front they are a little bit more than ice breaking activities although a lot of them could be ice breaking activities and they are not really so much testing activities
emi4hyw42fs_10-5-rgb_front why
emi4hyw42fs_11-5-rgb_front cause i am really happy today
emi4hyw42fs_12-5-rgb_front well i made an angry face because i am really mad that i missed the bus this morning or whatever it is
emi4hyw42fs_13-5-rgb_front so this is a wonderful way to teach emotions by letting the kids experience and show the emotions that they are feeling or the emotions that they wanted to express in that moment
emi4hyw42fs_2-5-rgb_front the first one i want to talk about it called pass the face
emi4hyw42fs_3-5-rgb_front you have everybody sit in a circle they are all sitting down and one person is going to make a face
emi4hyw42fs_4-5-rgb_front like a happy face or a sad face or an angry face and then everybody in the circle repeats that face
emi4hyw42fs_5-5-rgb_front so i make a sad face the sad face goes all the way around the room
emi4hyw42fs_6-5-rgb_front then the person next to me might make a funny face and it goes all around the circle and then the next person might make an angry face all the way around the circle everybody repeats the angry face
emi4hyw42fs_7-5-rgb_front so we go all around the circle with everyone getting to make a face we pass all the faces so everybody gets to do the faces and then we can talk about emotions
emi4hyw42fs_8-5-rgb_front what face did you make
emi4hyw42fs_9-5-rgb_front well i made a happy face
en-wlnmbpji_0-3-rgb_front welcome
en-wlnmbpji_1-3-rgb_front this section is called providing great customer service
en-wlnmbpji_10-3-rgb_front whatever you have that helps you utilize your expertise and communicate that knowledge to your customer is only going to help you assist them in a much much better manner
en-wlnmbpji_3-3-rgb_front the next step that we are going to talk about again in the basic elements of providing customer service is utilizing their expertise
en-wlnmbpji_4-3-rgb_front now this is easier than said or done but a lot of people who provide customer service do not really realize how many resources they have just at their hands so that they can go ahead and help the customers
en-wlnmbpji_5-3-rgb_front now as you continue with any business you are going to learn a lot more about that
en-wlnmbpji_6-3-rgb_front take your knowledge and share it with the customer
en-wlnmbpji_7-3-rgb_front any time you can educate your customer and we will speak about this a little bit more in detail later
en-wlnmbpji_8-3-rgb_front then you are helping that customer better communicate with you what their expectations may be in the future
en-wlnmbpji_9-3-rgb_front you also have a lot of tools available to you as well whether it may be a computer system maybe you may have data base that you can pull up different information on your customer maybe you have very specific tools of the trade whether it be a wrench or a hammer or your pen
enbcyrl4x3y_1-8-rgb_front let me show you what cilantro looks like here is cilantro and it is very aromatic and its on a stem
enbcyrl4x3y_2-8-rgb_front what i have done is i stemmed it now do not chop it because you want the whole leaf you rub this little bit between your fingers i wish you can smell that
enbcyrl4x3y_3-8-rgb_front add about a cup maybe three quarters of a cup of cilantro to the mix now what i am going to do next is i am going to mix this up
enbcyrl4x3y_4-8-rgb_front mix it as well as you can and then add just a little bit of juice
enbcyrl4x3y_5-8-rgb_front not to much and then mix everything up together
enbcyrl4x3y_6-8-rgb_front this is your first mix we have a second mix coming up
en_lv4gfl_a_0-8-rgb_front having inconsistent tense usage drives editors crazy
en_lv4gfl_a_1-8-rgb_front because as someone is cutting together video you hear someone saying something in the present tense like so i am going for a walk
en_lv4gfl_a_10-8-rgb_front now of course getting someone to speak in the present tense is harder than it sounds because people naturally fall into the past tense when they are telling a story
en_lv4gfl_a_11-8-rgb_front so the solution is to pause for a second say to someone hey can you say that one more time that sounded great but let is have you say that like this
en_lv4gfl_a_12-8-rgb_front and after a while your subject will get into the rhythm of speaking in the present tense
en_lv4gfl_a_2-8-rgb_front and then all of a sudden it cuts to them in past tense it was really tiring
en_lv4gfl_a_3-8-rgb_front now it may have made sense in the context of the conversation because someone was telling you a story and then later on they are talking about how they feel but when it is all cut together people are going to be slipping back and forth through different tenses
en_lv4gfl_a_4-8-rgb_front so you want to have a consistent tense usage
en_lv4gfl_a_5-8-rgb_front i prefer to always have people speak in the present tense
en_lv4gfl_a_6-8-rgb_front that just lends to more consistency because someone can tell a story in the present tense
en_lv4gfl_a_7-8-rgb_front jokes are usually told in the present tense
en_lv4gfl_a_8-8-rgb_front you say so a guy goes for a walk not guy was going for a walk and that way everything is more consistent overall
en_lv4gfl_a_9-8-rgb_front speaking in the present tense also helps draw the viewer into the story because if someone is speaking in the present tense then the viewer feels like it is happening as the story is told whereas if something is told in the past tense well then it is old news
eohrybleps4_0-11-rgb_front hi
eohrybleps4_1-11-rgb_front i am robin with com
eohrybleps4_10-11-rgb_front it might not be the proper way to hold a crochet hook but it works well for crocheting wire which is a lot different than crocheting yarn
eohrybleps4_11-11-rgb_front just always remember to keep the hook part towards you and to keep the crochet hook horizontal with the floor and you should not have any problems with holding your crochet hook
eohrybleps4_3-11-rgb_front we are crocheting wire to make a christmas bracelet
eohrybleps4_4-11-rgb_front on your crochet hook if you have never crocheted before you need to remember to hold the crochet hook parallel to your body horizontal to the floor
eohrybleps4_5-11-rgb_front the hook part is always towards you
eohrybleps4_6-11-rgb_front your thumb will go on the little part that is indented and your fingers just wrap around the crochet hook
eohrybleps4_7-11-rgb_front you just hold it just like this
eohrybleps4_8-11-rgb_front sort of like you might hold a spoon or a fork
eohrybleps4_9-11-rgb_front this is the way i do it
ep6wvtj7yjk_0-5-rgb_front in this segment we are going to learn a little bit about our bindings the things that hold your feet to your board
ep6wvtj7yjk_1-5-rgb_front they re pretty important
ep6wvtj7yjk_10-5-rgb_front if you strap them in too loose you re not going to have a good connection with your snowboard

ep6wvtj7yjk_5-5-rgb_front these are your ladders
ep6wvtj7yjk_6-5-rgb_front to strap in simply put your foot inside the binding
ep6wvtj7yjk_7-5-rgb_front connect the ratchet to the ladder and strap it down
ep6wvtj7yjk_8-5-rgb_front you want a good amount of pressure on both of them so they are really holding your binding your foot to the binding
ep6wvtj7yjk_9-5-rgb_front you do not want any loose movement

epaynv0nmqk_9-5-rgb_front the guy will love that
eq4tpcxpwsg_0-8-rgb_front depending on how soft the rubber is on your tire and and how much rubber you have on the sidewall your tires can wear out from anywhere from a thousand miles to two or three thousand miles
eq4tpcxpwsg_1-8-rgb_front you do not need to use an odometer and keep track of every mile that you ride
eq4tpcxpwsg_10-8-rgb_front but if we compare that to the tire that i have on the rear of my bike we are going to see a lot more prominent wear
eq4tpcxpwsg_11-8-rgb_front the first thing that i notice is the threads are starting to become apparent on the sidewall here
eq4tpcxpwsg_12-8-rgb_front and then when i sight the tire from the top i see that it is got some flat spots in it which is a good sign of wear
eq4tpcxpwsg_13-8-rgb_front and when a tire gets a flat spot like that it starts to steer a little bit oddly
eq4tpcxpwsg_14-8-rgb_front and then now when i look real closely at the tread i see that i have got a lot more rock drilling and thin spots on the rubber that i do on the other tire
eq4tpcxpwsg_2-8-rgb_front you can simply look at your tire
eq4tpcxpwsg_3-8-rgb_front the tire that i have here on the front of my bike that is in my left hand right now is still really usable
eq4tpcxpwsg_4-8-rgb_front if you hold it up and spin it you still that it is still nice and round across the top
eq4tpcxpwsg_5-8-rgb_front it doesn t have any flat spots or anything
eq4tpcxpwsg_6-8-rgb_front and when you get close and look at it again you see that it does not have any real big holes from rock drilling or anything like that
eq4tpcxpwsg_7-8-rgb_front and the other thing that you do is you check the sidewall
eq4tpcxpwsg_8-8-rgb_front and you want to make sure that you do not see any places where it is threadbare or the tube is poking out or anything like that
eq4tpcxpwsg_9-8-rgb_front you can see this tire has seen some use and has been nicked with some outdoor conditions because it is faded here on the hot patch
eqejh8_dxsk_0-3-rgb_front my name is anthony maddaloni i am a professional photographer from austin texas
eqejh8_dxsk_1-3-rgb_front i am going to talk about tripods
eqejh8_dxsk_10-3-rgb_front it is got three legs and folds down
eqejh8_dxsk_11-3-rgb_front here it extends and locks
eqejh8_dxsk_12-3-rgb_front i like tripods like this because they do not have the locks on them
eqejh8_dxsk_13-3-rgb_front i found that some tripods i have that have the locks they strip
eqejh8_dxsk_14-3-rgb_front this just screws in and locks
eqejh8_dxsk_15-3-rgb_front but that is me it is what i prefer
eqejh8_dxsk_16-3-rgb_front other people like the other kind
eqejh8_dxsk_17-3-rgb_front this is the head of the tripod
eqejh8_dxsk_18-3-rgb_front it tilts like this and like this
eqejh8_dxsk_19-3-rgb_front this is a very basic tripod
eqejh8_dxsk_2-3-rgb_front this is my tripod
eqejh8_dxsk_20-3-rgb_front a lot of tripods the more professional kinds have levels on them
eqejh8_dxsk_21-3-rgb_front so you would actually have a spirit level built into the tripod to make sure that you are level when you are focusing
eqejh8_dxsk_22-3-rgb_front this is a pretty important factor
eqejh8_dxsk_23-3-rgb_front i tend to use a level on my cameras
eqejh8_dxsk_24-3-rgb_front i have a small level that i put on
eqejh8_dxsk_25-3-rgb_front it is just easier for me to work that way
eqejh8_dxsk_26-3-rgb_front there is no better or worse
eqejh8_dxsk_27-3-rgb_front i do have tripods that have levels in them and they are when i am photographing architecture extremely necessary for me to have
eqejh8_dxsk_28-3-rgb_front right here is where your camera will screw into
eqejh8_dxsk_29-3-rgb_front and again you just want to place it
eqejh8_dxsk_3-3-rgb_front i have had it for many many years
eqejh8_dxsk_30-3-rgb_front you do not want to put your camera into a tripod too tight
eqejh8_dxsk_31-3-rgb_front i have seen people put them on so tight that it is really hard to get them off
eqejh8_dxsk_32-3-rgb_front so do not go crazy you just want to screw that in
eqejh8_dxsk_33-3-rgb_front some tripods also have what is called a speed mount meaning that you can put it on your tripod and take it off very quickly
eqejh8_dxsk_34-3-rgb_front this one does not but again i like it because it is just so simple and so easy for me to use
eqejh8_dxsk_35-3-rgb_front and this is a tripod
eqejh8_dxsk_4-3-rgb_front it is a very sturdy trusty tripod
eqejh8_dxsk_5-3-rgb_front one thing i like about it it is heavy and it is very very sturdy
eqejh8_dxsk_6-3-rgb_front and pretty easy to bring around with me
eqejh8_dxsk_7-3-rgb_front the first thing you can see when it is collapsed it is about two and a half feet in length
eqejh8_dxsk_8-3-rgb_front it is not really long and it is easy to carry
eqejh8_dxsk_9-3-rgb_front that is one thing that i do like about it
equ6docto2q_0-5-rgb_front while we are talking about mixing or singly that brings us to tip number three or design your own signature scents
equ6docto2q_1-5-rgb_front many brands nowadays most notable joe malone tend to sell their perfume in single scent notes or single scent oils
equ6docto2q_2-5-rgb_front the advantage to this kind of perfume over a simple regular perfume which is and often goes under a designer label is that with a single note scent you can mix up to seven of these scents on your body to determine your own personal signature scent
equ6docto2q_3-5-rgb_front your own opinion may change from day to day of what you like best so having the option to design your own gives you the greatest freedom and flexibility in choosing a perfume that is for you and you alone
equ6docto2q_4-5-rgb_front if you buy several of these scents you can mix them in different combinations on different days and for day and night and each time you will get a slightly different scent
equ6docto2q_5-5-rgb_front whereas if you buy a single designer scent you are always going to end up with the same scent
er9yieotaka_0-5-rgb_front so we have our yummy bacon i am taking it to our cast iron grill which is kind of smoking right now which is the way i want it
er9yieotaka_1-5-rgb_front this really brings me home because it is cast iron it is grandma is it is a variation on a traditional dish that i grew up with
er9yieotaka_10-5-rgb_front she had her own big garden chickens running around it was amazing
er9yieotaka_11-5-rgb_front it starting me on my culinary journey
er9yieotaka_12-5-rgb_front looking at this job takes me right back to it
er9yieotaka_13-5-rgb_front as you can see our bacon is starting to crisp up nicely it is going to give a lot of nice flavor to our meat
er9yieotaka_2-5-rgb_front i want to turn my flame down to about a medium flame you do not want the bacon to burn
er9yieotaka_3-5-rgb_front you do not want the pork fat to burn as my grandmother would say
er9yieotaka_4-5-rgb_front if this was my grandmother she would not be using bacon she would be using lard and fat back which is something that i use sometimes but bacon seems to be a lot more convenient
er9yieotaka_5-5-rgb_front it is got the nice smoky flavor
er9yieotaka_6-5-rgb_front my grandmother had a farm in wisconsin
er9yieotaka_7-5-rgb_front when ever she got bacon it was from the pig smoked there no preservatives no bad stuff in it
er9yieotaka_8-5-rgb_front all the meat was definitely big it was half the size of a cow
er9yieotaka_9-5-rgb_front i grew up really having a wonderful experience with food
erpbk4lejfi_0-8-rgb_front hi i am jason previous mac genius and today we are going to talk about how to switch users on a mac
erpbk4lejfi_1-8-rgb_front and what we need to do to start this is to add a user which is always a good idea for troubleshooting
erpbk4lejfi_10-8-rgb_front we are going to create this account and we are going to turn automatic log in off
erpbk4lejfi_11-8-rgb_front this does not really matter
erpbk4lejfi_12-8-rgb_front you can change this setting later
erpbk4lejfi_13-8-rgb_front i am going to turn it off
erpbk4lejfi_14-8-rgb_front and so now you can see here we have got tim and bing hough
erpbk4lejfi_15-8-rgb_front and if you want to switch between these two what we need to do is click on the log in options here and enable fast user switching
erpbk4lejfi_16-8-rgb_front you are going to get this warning this feature will allow other users to stay logged in and continue running software in the background while you are using this computer
erpbk4lejfi_17-8-rgb_front this is okay like it says here use this if you trust people family members things like that
erpbk4lejfi_18-8-rgb_front so i am going to say okay
erpbk4lejfi_19-8-rgb_front then you will notice up here we have got these two log in screens there
erpbk4lejfi_2-8-rgb_front a lot of geniuses will talk about this as a troubleshooting thing as well
erpbk4lejfi_20-8-rgb_front so i am going to switch to tim and it is going to ask us for tim is password which is tim and we are going to log in and you are going to get that beautifully revolving thing
erpbk4lejfi_21-8-rgb_front hopefully your screen catcher is still working and right now it is giving us basic systems for tim
erpbk4lejfi_22-8-rgb_front and i am going to go back up here and go back to my original
erpbk4lejfi_23-8-rgb_front we are going to go back into tim and what we need to do if we want to get rid of tim is account is we need to log him out
erpbk4lejfi_24-8-rgb_front so the switch is over here so here is tim is screen and it gives you basically every sets on your system preferences and everything like that for a new user
erpbk4lejfi_25-8-rgb_front and we are going to log tim out because we want to throw get rid of his account
erpbk4lejfi_26-8-rgb_front and so we are going to log in here
erpbk4lejfi_27-8-rgb_front okay
erpbk4lejfi_28-8-rgb_front now we can select tim and we can subtract him
erpbk4lejfi_29-8-rgb_front delete immediately
erpbk4lejfi_3-8-rgb_front so we are going to go on to our system preferences
erpbk4lejfi_30-8-rgb_front yes
erpbk4lejfi_31-8-rgb_front and you can set parameters and parental controls for each of the accounts you have as well so that is always a good thing to keep in mind if you have got younger children on the computer
erpbk4lejfi_32-8-rgb_front i am jason previous mac genius and i will speak with you later
erpbk4lejfi_33-8-rgb_front bye
erpbk4lejfi_4-8-rgb_front we are going to click on accounts to make changes right here
erpbk4lejfi_5-8-rgb_front so i am going to click on this and i am going to put in the system admin password and that is going to unlock us
erpbk4lejfi_6-8-rgb_front and i want to add a user so i am going to add tim
erpbk4lejfi_7-8-rgb_front it is going to come up with the short name automatically which you can change if you would like to
erpbk4lejfi_8-8-rgb_front we are going to leave that and we are going to change tim is password to tim
erpbk4lejfi_9-8-rgb_front verify that tim and then we will just say name and this can be anything you want
errylmfzezm_0-5-rgb_front there are two ways of removing paint before it dries
errylmfzezm_1-5-rgb_front one way is to go back with a brush and just remove paint in the brush because the brush will put paint down and it will also remove paint
errylmfzezm_2-5-rgb_front another way to remove paint is to have a paper towel ready and blot the paint out
errylmfzezm_3-5-rgb_front if you are working with small areas you will want to twist the paper towel and dab it in the areas you want to remove the paint from but you have to do this before it dries
errylmfzezm_4-5-rgb_front it only takes a few minutes to dry
errylmfzezm_5-5-rgb_front if the paint is already dry what you will have to do is wet the area like this
errylmfzezm_6-5-rgb_front then you may have to leave it for a few minutes so it will soak in and then you can blot it
errylmfzezm_7-5-rgb_front you see where i have blotted it is removed paint
errylmfzezm_8-5-rgb_front in a lot of cases you can not remove the paint entirely it is just impossible but you can get some of it out
esnx4yoy2m8_0_1_2-5-rgb_front hi i am harveywhittier i am the owner of perfect tan here in orem utah we are a full service tanning salon we have twenty different tanning beds and an automated spray tan system
esnx4yoy2m8_3-5-rgb_front i have been asked before does hair spray make you tan faster
esnx4yoy2m8_4-5-rgb_front and in reality yes you can use hairspray and it does help develop your tan but i would not recommend it
esnx4yoy2m8_5-5-rgb_front the possibility of outside using it you could but remember it does not have any sunscreen in it and the chances are you are going to get burned
esnx4yoy2m8_6-5-rgb_front secondly it is going to be very sticky
esnx4yoy2m8_7-5-rgb_front inside a tanning salon we have these acrylics that you lay on and it will damage the acrylics and so we do not allow anything into a tanning salon that is not been approved for indoor tanning
esnx4yoy2m8_8-5-rgb_front so it has to say approved for indoor tanning before we let any of our clients use any other kind of product
esnx4yoy2m8_9_10-5-rgb_front so hairspray definitely not i would not recommend it would it help possibility but definitely i do not know if i would recommend that as part of your tanning process
eux-pndmh-g_0-5-rgb_front hi i am ken kashabura personal trainer and free lance fitness writer and this is how to duck walk
eux-pndmh-g_1-5-rgb_front what you do whenever you are trying to do your duck walk is you want to start with your feet shoulder width apart
eux-pndmh-g_10-5-rgb_front but if you do not have any knee injuries duck walks are fine
eux-pndmh-g_11-5-rgb_front i am ken kashabura and that is how to duck walk
eux-pndmh-g_2-5-rgb_front with your feet shoulder width apart you are going to squat down nice and deep
eux-pndmh-g_3-5-rgb_front when you take your first step you are going to step forward and you want to get that front foot flat on the floor and your back foot is going to be on the toe
eux-pndmh-g_4-5-rgb_front and then you are going to continue from there one foot after the other with the front foot being flat on the floor
eux-pndmh-g_5-5-rgb_front now what you want to do as well with your arms is you want to take your arms and you want to get em from your ear to the side of your hip and keep em in tight
eux-pndmh-g_6-5-rgb_front and you are going each step the opposite arm is coming with you just like just like you are running
eux-pndmh-g_7-5-rgb_front so if you are running it is the same hand motion okay
eux-pndmh-g_8-5-rgb_front duck walks are good for sprinting to help with the flexibility in there and they are also good for wrestling if you are trying to do the shoot take your opponent down then you will be able to have the flexibility and still maintain strength during the flexibility while you are reaching for your shoot
eux-pndmh-g_9-5-rgb_front a lot of times people say that duck walking is bad for your knees and if you have knee injuries then yes you probably should not do duck walks
evxmvkdabuc_1-1-rgb_front we are creating gift baskets and this theme is about chocolate
evxmvkdabuc_10-1-rgb_front so let me put that in
evxmvkdabuc_11-1-rgb_front barney is always has a good selection of hot chocolate and flavors
evxmvkdabuc_12-1-rgb_front here is a french vanilla and gingerbread and they can go in
evxmvkdabuc_13-1-rgb_front and i think it is fun putting together things that compliment as well as just other things that you know the person would like for example here is an original maple syrup and that is good for somebody with a sweet tooth so we thought we would put that in
evxmvkdabuc_14-1-rgb_front here is another flavor that compliments chocolate really well and i found these key lime cookies in roth is as well
evxmvkdabuc_15-1-rgb_front sometimes in the stores in the keys in florida you will find these
evxmvkdabuc_16-1-rgb_front key lime goes really well with chocolate
evxmvkdabuc_17-1-rgb_front then i found one of these festive tins and that is really neat and they can be reused as well
evxmvkdabuc_18-1-rgb_front in here i put a lot of the lyndore chocolates and they are really good because they are already individually wrapped and there is a variety of flavors too white and milk and dark chocolate so that is neat and i put a lot of them in here and then as well i saved some out so that we can just toss them over at the end and that will look pretty
evxmvkdabuc_19-1-rgb_front then not only for kids but sometimes adults like little characters as well and here is another flavor that compliments chocolate as well peppermint
evxmvkdabuc_2-1-rgb_front i have put together a bunch of different items as we will call recipes to go into the basket
evxmvkdabuc_20-1-rgb_front so we will put her in there
evxmvkdabuc_21-1-rgb_front then we found of course cadbury is
evxmvkdabuc_22-1-rgb_front you could not have a chocolate basket without something from cadbury is
evxmvkdabuc_23-1-rgb_front we found another hot chocolate mix and we will put that in
evxmvkdabuc_24-1-rgb_front and of course we have got our festive mug to go put our hot chocolate in it is an elephant he is kind of cute
evxmvkdabuc_25-1-rgb_front and a piesta resistance is godiva liquor
evxmvkdabuc_26-1-rgb_front they have got different flavors as well milk chocolate dark chocolate and white
evxmvkdabuc_27-1-rgb_front i have chosen dark for this one
evxmvkdabuc_28-1-rgb_front so there we have different ideas of things you can put together for your chocolate theme
evxmvkdabuc_29-1-rgb_front we will get together in the next segment and we will see how to put them all together
evxmvkdabuc_3-1-rgb_front what we have done is we have put together things that have to do with chocolate or that will compliment chocolate
evxmvkdabuc_30-1-rgb_front catch up with you
evxmvkdabuc_4-1-rgb_front you do not always have to stick to everything chocolate
evxmvkdabuc_5-1-rgb_front but to start with we found a really neat chocolate lovers cookbook and we thought that would be a lot of fun because there will be all kinds of recipes in there to play with
evxmvkdabuc_6-1-rgb_front then we thought we would put together some hot chocolate ideas
evxmvkdabuc_7-1-rgb_front here is a group of three and this one is really neat
evxmvkdabuc_8-1-rgb_front peppermint as well as the other flavors and that is kind of different
evxmvkdabuc_9-1-rgb_front you will find that stores like roth is and tj maxx as well as a world market if you have one of those in your neighborhood they have usually got a lot of good selections of things from all over the world so you get some good ideas in there
ewkhufqm9gi_1-5-rgb_front today we will try to break a board
ewkhufqm9gi_10-5-rgb_front next step is positioning the body for it
ewkhufqm9gi_11-5-rgb_front our position for the next break which will be a fist one board fist is walking stance which is about shoulder with a distance from the board
ewkhufqm9gi_12-5-rgb_front you have to be able to to the board and you have to be able to strike in a smooth movement
ewkhufqm9gi_2-5-rgb_front our next move in board breaking to position the board properly and to be able to break with a clean cut
ewkhufqm9gi_3-5-rgb_front okay
ewkhufqm9gi_4-5-rgb_front our next move basically coming down and take a look at the board
ewkhufqm9gi_5-5-rgb_front okay
ewkhufqm9gi_6-5-rgb_front because it is a pine board we have grains going down on the board and if you try to have those grains line up in a way if you are doing a knife hand or you are doing a fist it is lined up horizontally compared to our fist
ewkhufqm9gi_7-5-rgb_front our next step should be make sure that the bricks are distanced proportionately
ewkhufqm9gi_8-5-rgb_front there should be about half an inch cover on that board
ewkhufqm9gi_9-5-rgb_front okay
ewv6xcewnvk_0-8-rgb_front so you are looking for a new hair style
ewv6xcewnvk_1-8-rgb_front your hair may be short or fine
ewv6xcewnvk_10-8-rgb_front and as you can see i have already attached it to the base hair extension that i am going to use
ewv6xcewnvk_11-8-rgb_front so now what i am going to do is place it right on the braid go under the braid and through the top of the hair extension here
ewv6xcewnvk_12-8-rgb_front go ahead and use your thread to create a knot pull your needle all the way through and boom you first attached your hair
ewv6xcewnvk_13-8-rgb_front so would simple create this all the way across the hair remembering to take your time
ewv6xcewnvk_14-8-rgb_front and remember this is something that may be time consuming so you will want to make sure that you have plenty of time to finish
ewv6xcewnvk_15-8-rgb_front it is something that is not the easiest to do yourself at home you may want to check with your local professional who can give you a beautiful sew in hair extension
ewv6xcewnvk_16-8-rgb_front my name is sylvia russell and this is how you can sew in hair extensions
ewv6xcewnvk_2-8-rgb_front and you want to sew in some hair extensions
ewv6xcewnvk_3-8-rgb_front well my name is sylvia russell and this is how you sew in hair extensions
ewv6xcewnvk_4-8-rgb_front so i have my hair i have picked it curly and dark so that you can see the contrast between the light and the dark
ewv6xcewnvk_5-8-rgb_front you can actually see how it is done
ewv6xcewnvk_6-8-rgb_front you have got to first put a braid at the back of your hair
ewv6xcewnvk_7-8-rgb_front this is the most conventional way to sew in hair extensions
ewv6xcewnvk_8-8-rgb_front once you have created your base of a braid you can begin your hair extensions
ewv6xcewnvk_9-8-rgb_front now you are going to use a needle and thread like i have here
eyehiz6y0fs_0-5-rgb_front so another neat thing about stained glass is that really all you are doing is sticking pieces of glass together the way that you want to
eyehiz6y0fs_1-5-rgb_front there is a lot of creativity that you can explore by using different kinds of glass
eyehiz6y0fs_2-5-rgb_front for example there is no reason you find an old mirror and cut it up into pieces that kind of get integrated into your design because a mirror is about the same thickness as the glass that we use in stained glass and you can prepare those pieces of mirror with lead cane or with copper foil and integrate little pieces of mirror into your design
eyehiz6y0fs_3-5-rgb_front you can even you can buy a type of glass that is called beveled glass this is generally a clear glass but it has a nice cut bevel to the edges so that is almost looks like little gems kind of like crystals or diamonds they have kind of a texture to them
eyehiz6y0fs_4-5-rgb_front i like using these glass kind of these melted glass marbles and you can get these in all kinds of craft stores
eyehiz6y0fs_5-5-rgb_front it is important that you do use glass and not plastic or some other material but these are cool i mean you can incorporate these into your designs as things like i know the centers of flowers or you can make eyeballs out of them or i like using them as kind of these soft white ones i have used them as bubbles in kind of a aquatic stained glass i did once with kind of a fish and so again if they are made out of glass anything that is made out of glass you know if you want to try to integrate it into a stained glass panel you usually can
eyew-9w4dri_1-3-rgb_front okay we have our pasta boiling we have our sauce we just added the mushrooms too together
eyew-9w4dri_10-3-rgb_front but these are just perfect for this so you just go ahead and grab it again take that top part off and just pull it right out
eyew-9w4dri_11-3-rgb_front see the legs and all of that come out be squeamish about this this is real easy and your reward is wonderful
eyew-9w4dri_12-3-rgb_front so and again want to rinse these once done but see how this just pulls right out just by grasping the tail sort of like a handle
eyew-9w4dri_13-3-rgb_front so what we want to do is probably about five or six of these per person at about this size this is probably about a what they call a to count shrimp which means there is to shrimp per pound
eyew-9w4dri_2-3-rgb_front and now going to show you how going to peel our beautiful shrimp
eyew-9w4dri_3-3-rgb_front now these are called gulf pink shrimp so they come from the gulf of mexico
eyew-9w4dri_4-3-rgb_front i prefer these over the ones from thailand tiger shrimp but just my own taste you can do it
eyew-9w4dri_5-3-rgb_front so what you want to do is you can see the shells on these are very very light
eyew-9w4dri_6-3-rgb_front so go ahead and take that first part off and just pull them right out just like that
eyew-9w4dri_7-3-rgb_front sometimes with these sizes of shrimp you really find a mud vein too much in the the back of them
eyew-9w4dri_8-3-rgb_front worry if you if you get the bigger shrimp sometimes they do
eyew-9w4dri_9-3-rgb_front all you need to do is just run the blade of the knife around the back and just pull it right out and just rinse it and be fine
eyfkrcetyy8_1-3-rgb_front today i would be talking about how to tack up a horse
eyfkrcetyy8_10-3-rgb_front so it is even on both sides of his back
eyfkrcetyy8_2-3-rgb_front next we would be putting on the saddle pad and the back pad
eyfkrcetyy8_3-3-rgb_front not everyone uses a back pad and we would start with just the saddle pad
eyfkrcetyy8_4-3-rgb_front so you know that the front is a front cause it has a strap for the girth to go through and a strap that attaches to the gullet of the saddle
eyfkrcetyy8_5-3-rgb_front so we are going to put this on and it should come up to half of his withers in the middle of his withers
eyfkrcetyy8_6-3-rgb_front there is a example of basic back pads it is just a fleece general supporting protecting pad
eyfkrcetyy8_7-3-rgb_front this is for raising up the back of your saddle to give it a better fit
eyfkrcetyy8_8-3-rgb_front so today we are just going to use this basic fleece back pad
eyfkrcetyy8_9-3-rgb_front you just want to line it up so that the back pad does not go any further then the saddle pad and that it is lined up evenly with this side
eza0r3knbyc_1-5-rgb_front one of the last things that you can do if you had a weekend thing you can go to church together this is a great time to go especially if it is the home church that the children grow up in and they can take there children and say hey this is where mom and dad grew up this is where i took communion
eza0r3knbyc_2-5-rgb_front a lot of times like in ours it was a small town so i took my children and we did a we sang those old hems that a lot of kids are not use to now because maybe they go to church with a contemporary christian music and they have the old legged cross and in the garden and all those amazing grace and all those old hems and that was great
eza0r3knbyc_3-5-rgb_front this year on our family reunion a lot of them where not going to be able to attend on sunday so we had a concert on friday night that my daughter did at the church and a lot of them went and heard her sing
eza0r3knbyc_4-5-rgb_front some have never heard her sing so that was a great idea
eza0r3knbyc_5-5-rgb_front so church is kind of a neat way to end up or you can have your own church service if you are out in the country
eza0r3knbyc_6-5-rgb_front if you go to church and do that it is made that usually you have somebody who is probably one of your spiritual people in your family can give it you can sing the hems together and that is a really neat thing also
eza2n6-oiec_0-5-rgb_front in this segment we are going to be talking about jump roping and how jump roping is effective for boxing and how boxing is affected by jump roping
eza2n6-oiec_1-5-rgb_front we are going to be talking about the different types of jump ropes
eza2n6-oiec_10-5-rgb_front so as we expand upon the different clips we are going to mention more detail on the jump roping
eza2n6-oiec_2-5-rgb_front we are going to talk about plastic speed ropes
eza2n6-oiec_3-5-rgb_front we are going to be talking about some heavier leather jump ropes with the way it handles
eza2n6-oiec_4-5-rgb_front we are going to be talking about how to determine the length of the jump rope that you would need
eza2n6-oiec_5-5-rgb_front we are going to cover a little bit about the actual proper footwear to wear for jump roping
eza2n6-oiec_6-5-rgb_front we are going to be talking about some basic moves for jump roping and we are going to have one of our boxing students show you the basic moves and also some of the more advanced moves
eza2n6-oiec_7-5-rgb_front some of the other things we are going to be covering are the different constructions of the jump ropes themselves and how to adjust them if you need to adjust them
eza2n6-oiec_8-5-rgb_front the place of the jump rope you should be jumping like on a jump rope mat for instance or in the mat in the ring
eza2n6-oiec_9-5-rgb_front you should try to stay off concrete for instance and things like that
ezdsbfrrqxm_0-4-rgb_front now i am going to show you how to give a prep beat for the ensemble to come in on beat four
ezdsbfrrqxm_1-4-rgb_front in this way you would show beat three that is the beat right before and they would come in on beat four
ezdsbfrrqxm_2-4-rgb_front so on a pattern beat three is right here
ezdsbfrrqxm_3-4-rgb_front four one two three four
ezdsbfrrqxm_4-4-rgb_front let us try that again
ezdsbfrrqxm_5-4-rgb_front four one two three four
e_ubba0cdh0_0-5-rgb_front so very often the clue is so vague that it could be several words and once you have got some letters in the word already then it narrows down the possibilities
e_ubba0cdh0_1-5-rgb_front or even just having a letter or two for a word will give you a hint as to what the word is
e_ubba0cdh0_2-5-rgb_front you will think oh
e_ubba0cdh0_3-5-rgb_front of course
e_ubba0cdh0_4-5-rgb_front i did not think of that but i already got say the t and the o in there and that will lead me to the next word
e_ubba0cdh0_5-5-rgb_front i might come to the down clues now since i already have a word in at one across i have got the beginning letters for four clues
e_ubba0cdh0_6-5-rgb_front and number one down kernel three letters beginning with n is of course a nut
e_ubba0cdh0_7-5-rgb_front number two down a four letter word magnets attracted
e_ubba0cdh0_8-5-rgb_front we see it begins with an i gives us a good clue that the word is going to be iron
eahg_9v_nec_0_1-8-rgb_front hi i am j k dooley and i am a professional artist and we are talking a little bit now about paper choices when you have your giclee reproduction printed you can always choose paper to print on
eahg_9v_nec_2-8-rgb_front one of the advantages of paper is it is pretty simple to work with most people are used to paper
eahg_9v_nec_3-8-rgb_front it is a little fragile sometimes like anything else you have to be careful
eahg_9v_nec_4-8-rgb_front sometimes it can be very susceptible to picking up oil from your fingers or anything like that so you have to take some care when you are working with paper as well
eaugmymh6rc_10-5-rgb_front so that is your breaking pliers and in the next clip i am going to talk about the other pliers which are used for grozing
eaugmymh6rc_2-5-rgb_front it just kind of scores the glass with a thin crack and then you have to break that glass in a controlled manner
eaugmymh6rc_3-5-rgb_front there is a few ways to do it you can do it with your hands you can do it on the table we will go through some of those methods
eaugmymh6rc_4-5-rgb_front one way to do it is with pliers now so one of the sets of pliers that you get should be a set of breaking glass breaking pliers and if you go to a stained glass supply store you will be able to find some
eaugmymh6rc_5-5-rgb_front what they the thing that makes them breaking pliers is if you look at tip see how the tip comes together at an angle
eaugmymh6rc_6-5-rgb_front right the tip is not the two sides of the pliers do not come together parallel or come together flat they come together at an angle
eaugmymh6rc_7-5-rgb_front furthermore this particular set of pliers i like has kind of this sort of rubber kind of shoe this kind of protective rubber kind of on top of the metal which allows you to get a firm grip but it still provides a little bit of kind of protection of digging into that glass or maybe cracking that glass even more
eaugmymh6rc_8-5-rgb_front so you do not need to have those that sort of rubber housing on the tips but i like it
eaugmymh6rc_9-5-rgb_front and in this particular set of breaking pliers it also has a stop screw here where depending on where you set it you can so if i have it in all the way you see it kind of goes kind of through there now my pliers will not close any more than that so that can be helpful if you are working with glass of different thickness you just sort of put your glass in there and then turn this until it tightens up so no matter how much you squeeze you are not going to be putting any more pressure on the glass but you can imagine if i have the glass scored and you know i have it in like this i do not need a lot of pressure all i really need to do is just kind of bend down and if there is any kind of a score line there my glass will break and we are going to go through that technique so do not worry about it just yet
ebgnmos4d4u_0-8-rgb_front one typical problem i see with plants is that a lot of people come and water their water
ebgnmos4d4u_1-8-rgb_front they water on top and they get the leaves all wet and they think that the plant is happy
ebgnmos4d4u_10-8-rgb_front so we could turn this plant around and give it some good treatment
ebgnmos4d4u_11-8-rgb_front we stop wetting its leaves so if this were my plant i would really try hard to water from the side and not get the leaves wet so that would be the best method
ebgnmos4d4u_12-8-rgb_front you are not doing any favors by getting the whole plant wet
ebgnmos4d4u_2-8-rgb_front you can see that this plant is really not happy
ebgnmos4d4u_3-8-rgb_front i think a couple of things are happening in here
ebgnmos4d4u_4-8-rgb_front it could be over watered but these burn marks this is from watering and the water sits on the leaf for a long time and it acts as a magnifying glass in it
ebgnmos4d4u_5-8-rgb_front it burns the leaves
ebgnmos4d4u_6-8-rgb_front if i take off these leaves you know the plant would probably be okay but it is not pretty like that so we will try to encourage some new growth
ebgnmos4d4u_7-8-rgb_front what i would suggest to do is water the plant in the morning because that gives the plant plenty of time to dry out the leaves before the sun comes out at noon between noon and so this would not happen
ebgnmos4d4u_8-8-rgb_front also i see with this plant another thing you could do is dis bud all these flowers because the more you pull these off the more you are going to encourage it to bloom
ebgnmos4d4u_9-8-rgb_front this is a streptocarpella by the way that looks pretty terrible but it is really quite beautiful
ec9kthfkxxi_0-8-rgb_front hi
ec9kthfkxxi_1-8-rgb_front this lindsay colbus from lindsay colbus accessories
ec9kthfkxxi_10-8-rgb_front not only are we going to look at examples of how to dress for a hot saturday night date or a hot friday night date

edjgtx0ifee_0-5-rgb_front once again in this clip we are going to be hooping in the opposite direction a very challenging thing to do
edjgtx0ifee_1-5-rgb_front make sure that you give yourself some extra good energy when trying this
edjgtx0ifee_10-5-rgb_front bend your knees and start rocking slightly back and forth
edjgtx0ifee_11-5-rgb_front close your eyes and really feel the hoop moving around your body
edjgtx0ifee_12-5-rgb_front notice when it presses into your front right hip and into your back
edjgtx0ifee_13-5-rgb_front when the hoop presses against the right hip slowly start to turn to your right
edjgtx0ifee_14-5-rgb_front then you can either pivot on one foot or you can step with both feet
edjgtx0ifee_15-5-rgb_front kind of back and forth
edjgtx0ifee_16-5-rgb_front as you can see i am shifting the weight from right to left
edjgtx0ifee_17-5-rgb_front if the hoop starts to fall really give it a kick with that right hip to keep it going
edjgtx0ifee_18-5-rgb_front once again turning
edjgtx0ifee_19-5-rgb_front you can shift your weight
edjgtx0ifee_2-5-rgb_front i hoop to the left so now i am going to try it to the right
edjgtx0ifee_20-5-rgb_front make sure you are conscious of your arms
edjgtx0ifee_21-5-rgb_front it is real easy to do funny things with your arms in the hoop
edjgtx0ifee_22-5-rgb_front as you are turning pushing into the hoop let is try turning in the opposite direction
edjgtx0ifee_23-5-rgb_front hopefully i can do this
edjgtx0ifee_24-5-rgb_front it might be kind of funny
edjgtx0ifee_25-5-rgb_front once again if it starts to fall really give it that kick
edjgtx0ifee_26-5-rgb_front keep it going again
edjgtx0ifee_27-5-rgb_front alright let is try that one more time
edjgtx0ifee_28-5-rgb_front hooping in the opposite
edjgtx0ifee_29-5-rgb_front actually turning in the opposite direction
edjgtx0ifee_3-5-rgb_front spin the hoop to the left and off to the right
edjgtx0ifee_30-5-rgb_front like i said it is going to feel like you are in a blender
edjgtx0ifee_31-5-rgb_front be a little bit easier
edjgtx0ifee_32-5-rgb_front flowing with the hoop
edjgtx0ifee_33-5-rgb_front it if starts to fall give it that nice kick to keep it going
edjgtx0ifee_34-5-rgb_front turning away from the hoop and turning with the hoop
edjgtx0ifee_35-5-rgb_front the faster you turn the more the hoop will float
edjgtx0ifee_36-5-rgb_front the slower you turn the more you can guide it with the hips
edjgtx0ifee_37-5-rgb_front once again try lifting up onto the toes
edjgtx0ifee_38-5-rgb_front lifting up lifting up coming down
edjgtx0ifee_39-5-rgb_front this side is going to be a little strange
edjgtx0ifee_4-5-rgb_front here we go
edjgtx0ifee_40-5-rgb_front take your time
edjgtx0ifee_41-5-rgb_front have fun with it
edjgtx0ifee_42-5-rgb_front be patient with yourself
edjgtx0ifee_43-5-rgb_front you can do it
edjgtx0ifee_5-5-rgb_front when hannah was doing it one foot was in front of the other kind of rocking back and forth
edjgtx0ifee_6-5-rgb_front that is a great way to get the momentum of the hoop going but now we want to make it look a little bit cooler
edjgtx0ifee_7-5-rgb_front let is take the feet hip width distance apart
edjgtx0ifee_8-5-rgb_front actually my hips are not that wide
edjgtx0ifee_9-5-rgb_front a little bit further apart than hip width
eevxp0hn3qy_0-5-rgb_front hi i am kerri and i am at zebra in berkeley
eevxp0hn3qy_1-5-rgb_front i am here to talk about treating a tongue piercing infection
eevxp0hn3qy_2-5-rgb_front tongue piercing infections are rare
eevxp0hn3qy_3-5-rgb_front tongue piercings are the piercing in your body because it is the most important to your body
eevxp0hn3qy_4-5-rgb_front when they do get infected it is bad
eevxp0hn3qy_5-5-rgb_front really bad
eevxp0hn3qy_6-5-rgb_front the signs of a tongue infection is extreme discoloration and coating of the tongue sometimes in a yellow or greenish color
eevxp0hn3qy_7-5-rgb_front you will also see pus coming out of the entry and exit holes of the tongue
eevxp0hn3qy_8-5-rgb_front tongue piercings are very dangerous when they do get infected and so i am not even going to give any other option except for to go see a doctor
eevxp0hn3qy_9-5-rgb_front if you are not sure if your piercing is infected or not please visit your local professional body piercer and they will be able to tell you if it is truly infected or just going through the normal healing process
eeg85jitlz0_0-3-rgb_front another material that we use quite often when mono is likely to fail is wire leader straight single stranded wire leader
eeg85jitlz0_1-3-rgb_front now this is used primarily when you are catching mackerel or king fish or toothy critters that are going to chew through the filament
eeg85jitlz0_2-3-rgb_front it is vital at this point to have the wire leader
eeg85jitlz0_3-3-rgb_front now a lot of the wire leaders we use when we are trolling for king fish using spoons or live bait in conjunction with treble hooks you have got to have the wire leader because all they have got to do is just nip at it and it breaks
eeg85jitlz0_4-3-rgb_front now the wire leader needs to be actually twisted
eeg85jitlz0_5-3-rgb_front you can not use sleeves or any type of connection basically just twist it and make what is known as a hay wire twist and put our hook or spoon on and make this hay wire twist almost like an electrician is twist and we follow it up with a barrel twist and then we make a little handle and go back and forth until we break the little tab end off and you are in business
efhyeua7x_w_0-8-rgb_front when i teach people how to taste wine i approach the step of wine aromas by asking them t pick up the glass very quickly bring it up to their nose putting their nose down into it taking a nice deep inhale putting the glass down and thinking about what they smelled kind of like this
efhyeua7x_w_1-8-rgb_front usually people look confused and i have to draw it out of them
efhyeua7x_w_2-8-rgb_front i say what do you smell what do you smell
efhyeua7x_w_3-8-rgb_front sometimes they say well miss jane i smell alcohol or i smell wood or i smell fruit or spice and i say okay thank you very much but what do you really want to say
efhyeua7x_w_4-8-rgb_front eventually somebody will say miss jane i am sorry but it smells like wine and i say thank you very much and i give that person a round of applause because they are right
efhyeua7x_w_5-8-rgb_front what i asked them to do by just picking up the glass and putting their nose in it and smelling was just to get the initial impression of the smell of a wine or the wine is primary or first aroma and a wine is primary or first aroma will be smells like wine
efhyeua7x_w_6-8-rgb_front they do not pay us sommeliers to walk around saying smells like wine so we made up a word for that and the word for a wine is primary aroma smells like wine is vinosity
efhyeua7x_w_7-8-rgb_front it has vinosity or it is vinos smells like wine that is the way it should be
efhyeua7x_w_8-8-rgb_front after that you can use some more intensified wine smelling techniques to bring out all the other aromas and bouquets in a wine but the first smell will always be smells like wine
eh4czxdmmc8_10-8-rgb_front and also you incorporate air inside that flour and that air gives it space therefore it will mix much better inside the dough that you are trying to prepare
eh4czxdmmc8_11-8-rgb_front so we just just pour the flour in there
eh4czxdmmc8_12-8-rgb_front now because this flour is arrogated and it is sitting on top of the big chunk of butter and sugar well it has a tendency to just come out and be thrown out a bit
eh4czxdmmc8_13-8-rgb_front so expect a cloud there
eh4czxdmmc8_14-8-rgb_front because of that we turn off and on the oven i mean the mixer
eh4czxdmmc8_15-8-rgb_front we turn the mixer off and on constantly until the flour is kind of mixed in there so it will then be thrown all over the place
eh4czxdmmc8_16-8-rgb_front this is the most important and most critical point of cookie making
eh4czxdmmc8_17-8-rgb_front as soon as the flour is incorporated the minute the flour gets inside of that mixture that you had in there you want to stop the mixing process
eh4czxdmmc8_18-8-rgb_front you want to stop the mixing process otherwise you have
eh4czxdmmc8_19-8-rgb_front and if you this step took only two minutes
eh4czxdmmc8_20-8-rgb_front maybe minute and a half two minutes
eh4czxdmmc8_21-8-rgb_front if you as i mentioned before you are going to incorporate air into your cookie dough and the cookie dough will run all over the place
eh4czxdmmc8_22-8-rgb_front so as some of the flour is inside your mixture of butter and your sugar and your eggs you are ready to put your mixer on the off position and get the other ingredients which is chocolate chips inside your dough
eh4czxdmmc8_7-8-rgb_front you do not want to throw a flour that is caked in there because it will not mix properly
eh4czxdmmc8_8-8-rgb_front so we sift it to get all of the hard stuff out of it if if there is any hard stuff
eh4czxdmmc8_9-8-rgb_front normally there is none
eh697lcfjtw_0-3-rgb_front hi
eh697lcfjtw_1-3-rgb_front i am kelli
eh697lcfjtw_10-3-rgb_front some of the other foundations out there which i do not have with me today
eh697lcfjtw_11-3-rgb_front you can choose like a cream to powder foundation or even a mineral foundation works really well for all skins and all people
eh697lcfjtw_12-3-rgb_front it depends on what kind of coverage you want what your skin is like what kind of feel or what kind of texture you like on your face
eh697lcfjtw_13-3-rgb_front whether you are wanting more of a natural product such as a mineral makeup or you really like the liquid foundation or what you are more comfortable with
eh697lcfjtw_14-3-rgb_front those are some different options you have when you are trying to choose the foundation that is right for you
eh697lcfjtw_3-3-rgb_front when you are choosing a foundation you of course want to choose a type of foundation that you are going to be the most comfortable with
eh697lcfjtw_4-3-rgb_front be it a powder foundation
eh697lcfjtw_5-3-rgb_front these usually will work well for people who first of all want a quick application
eh697lcfjtw_6-3-rgb_front second of all if you are a little more on the oily side sometimes these work a little bit better for you than say a dry skin person
eh697lcfjtw_7-3-rgb_front you can also choose from a liquid foundation
eh697lcfjtw_8-3-rgb_front there is many different types of liquid foundations based on whether you are dry or you are oily or what kind of coverage you like
eh697lcfjtw_9-3-rgb_front there is a very wide variety of things that you can choose from
ehrydxh3otc_10-8-rgb_front i like to do it whenever i get a chance basically once a month i like to come out and put the gauge on there visually check them
ehrydxh3otc_11-8-rgb_front i give it a once over every day just walk by make sure the profile of the tire looks good it is not down on air ready to ride
ehrydxh3otc_12-8-rgb_front this is your ms marking on your tire for mud and snow and all season
ehrydxh3otc_13-8-rgb_front it is a radial tire
ehrydxh3otc_9-8-rgb_front we will do that on all four tires
ehkioccpxgw_1-5-rgb_front today we would be talking about table coverings in particular a table runner
ehkioccpxgw_10-5-rgb_front other table coverings that you might use might be a pleated tablecloth that might have pleats in the corners or one simple pleat in the side
ehkioccpxgw_11-5-rgb_front many different choses but the one that we would be working on today is a simple table runner with fringe on the edges
ehkioccpxgw_2-5-rgb_front there is a number of table coverings that you might like to make for decorative purpose
ehkioccpxgw_3-5-rgb_front a table such this large table here in front of me you might chose to just make a table cloth and trim the edge with fringe or just simple turn the edges under
ehkioccpxgw_4-5-rgb_front you can use a tablecloth as well as a table runner like the one that we would be making today
ehkioccpxgw_5-5-rgb_front there is a number of good patterns ideas that you can get from your local fabric store
ehkioccpxgw_6-5-rgb_front they have many ideas and suggestions on how to make table runners
ehkioccpxgw_7-5-rgb_front but this one was a good one that gave me some ideas for the one that i would be doing today
ehkioccpxgw_8-5-rgb_front i would be using some coordinated fabric different patterns but similar color schemes an other options that you might want to consider are gingham floral many different colors that work well together
ehkioccpxgw_9-5-rgb_front different types of trim that would also make a beautiful runner
eijtspdvqoo_0-4-rgb_front hi my name is lauren and i am here to discuss how to make your hair grow straight
eijtspdvqoo_1-4-rgb_front unfortunately there is no way to actually make your hair grow out of your scalp straight
eijtspdvqoo_2-4-rgb_front if you have naturally curly or wavy hair what that is is due to the protein bonds that your hair is actually made out of
eijtspdvqoo_3-4-rgb_front curly hair or wavy hair has more of a disulfide bond which is the way that the proteins are actually bonded together
eijtspdvqoo_4-4-rgb_front it creates that natural wave or curl within your hair
eijtspdvqoo_5-4-rgb_front there is nothing that you can actually do internally and make your hair not curly and have it grow out straight
eicynoertki_0-1-rgb_front going to talk about companionship during ice fishing
eicynoertki_1-1-rgb_front whether it is your first time ice fishing or your fiftieth time ice fishing it is always good to fish with someone
eicynoertki_2-1-rgb_front not only for companionship or if it is your first time fishing to kind of show you the ropes but when you are ice fishing you are typically hauling a lot of gear you have got to cut holes in the ice you have got to bait tip ups you have got hopefully clean fish at the end of the day so there is a lot of work that goes into it
eicynoertki_3-1-rgb_front having someone with you is great because it allows extra hands to help with all the work it is also very important from a safety aspect
eicynoertki_4-1-rgb_front as i mentioned safety is one of the most important things about ice fishing
eicynoertki_5-1-rgb_front when you are ice fishing and you are drilling holes with augers such as this that have very sharp blades does not always happen but you have to be careful if you were to cut your finger or your leg on these slip on one and fall on very glare ice conditions like we have here today fall through the ice anything like that very important to have someone fishing with you
ek_sdhcum7u_0-8-rgb_front lands are the foundation of your deck
ek_sdhcum7u_1-8-rgb_front they provide all of the manna or most of the manna that you use to cast spells to win
ek_sdhcum7u_10-8-rgb_front instead of saying tap add one green to your manna pool it only has the green manna symbol
ek_sdhcum7u_11-8-rgb_front it is understood that this can be tapped to add a green manna to your manna pool
ek_sdhcum7u_12-8-rgb_front this is far more simpler still
ek_sdhcum7u_13-8-rgb_front it just says forest and has a picture that takes up nearly the entire forest nearly the entire card
ek_sdhcum7u_14-8-rgb_front all three of these cards are identical in terms of game play value
ek_sdhcum7u_15-8-rgb_front the same would be true with any other of the five types
ek_sdhcum7u_2-8-rgb_front these three cards are all forests indicated by the forest at the top of the card
ek_sdhcum7u_3-8-rgb_front the name of the card is forest and that implies certain things about it
ek_sdhcum7u_4-8-rgb_front this is an old revised edition of forest
ek_sdhcum7u_5-8-rgb_front this is land halfway between the picture and the text box and it has a t tilted and a colon add one green manna to your manna pool
ek_sdhcum7u_6-8-rgb_front this is a much more recent forest from the lorwyn expansion set
ek_sdhcum7u_7-8-rgb_front and it says basic land dash forest which is like saying that it is a land with the name forest
ek_sdhcum7u_8-8-rgb_front but it is much more specific
ek_sdhcum7u_9-8-rgb_front as the sets have progressed the way the cards are templated has become much more refined
elklut10fcq_0-8-rgb_front in this series there is going to be clips involving working the heavy bag
elklut10fcq_1-8-rgb_front as part of the introduction what i want to stress is to actually wear a lot of protection
elklut10fcq_10-8-rgb_front then come back again to the heavy bag this time concentrate on speed
elklut10fcq_11-8-rgb_front do not worry about your power do not worry about getting everything perfect just snap off a lot of punches
elklut10fcq_12-8-rgb_front maybe wear the punch mitts and actually get a good count on a number of punches
elklut10fcq_13-8-rgb_front so a little bit later we are going to be discussing all the different moves on a heavy bag and exactly what we need to do
elklut10fcq_2-8-rgb_front you should always wrap your hands first there is also little covers you can wear if you do not want to do the actual wrapping
elklut10fcq_3-8-rgb_front and then a good pair of bag gloves also
elklut10fcq_4-8-rgb_front the other thing i want to stress is do not think you need to spend ten or fifteen minutes at a time on one bag just hitting that same bag over and over again
elklut10fcq_5-8-rgb_front what i like to see is approximately nine rounds per night on the heavy bag
elklut10fcq_6-8-rgb_front but what i like to see is have the boxer do three rounds with a normal speed and power and then go do something else speed bag or something and then come back to the heavy bag again
elklut10fcq_7-8-rgb_front this time concentrating on power maybe using a heavier bag
elklut10fcq_8-8-rgb_front do not worry about the speed part just on power
elklut10fcq_9-8-rgb_front and then go do something else bag maybe
elw15zj0fse_0-8-rgb_front another more natural option for your easter basket grass is to get a paper product grass
elw15zj0fse_1-8-rgb_front basically what this is is a paper product usually a very thin paper which then is sliced up and you can see you have a type of grass
elw15zj0fse_10-8-rgb_front any which way you have this you slice it up with a scissors and then that is very easy to do
elw15zj0fse_11-8-rgb_front you have your natural easter grass
elw15zj0fse_2-8-rgb_front now this is not real grass but you are getting closer to the real thing than plastic grass certainly
elw15zj0fse_3-8-rgb_front so this is a more natural environmental option for your easter basket
elw15zj0fse_4-8-rgb_front but keep in mind just because it looks a little more nature friendly and some of these things you can certainly recycle not necessarily always the best thing for the environment still
elw15zj0fse_5-8-rgb_front and what do i mean by this
elw15zj0fse_6-8-rgb_front i mean that oftentimes there is processing and dyes and all sorts of things
elw15zj0fse_7-8-rgb_front they can still go into this grass so if you are really worried and you want to help out the environment the easiest way to do it is make your own grass
elw15zj0fse_8-8-rgb_front have like a basic piece of paper a white piece of paper no problem at all
elw15zj0fse_9-8-rgb_front you can also get like a dyed construction paper if you want to
emjxmcutzz0_0-5-rgb_front shanay norvell jabs and punches are great because they immediately engage your upper body
emjxmcutzz0_1-5-rgb_front it is going to be shoulders chest triceps and biceps
emjxmcutzz0_10-5-rgb_front and let is take it to the other side and
emjxmcutzz0_11-5-rgb_front one final combination it will be a punch and a jab a punch and a jab two more and one
emjxmcutzz0_12-5-rgb_front then the other side a jab a punch jab punch two more and one
emjxmcutzz0_13-5-rgb_front those are jabs and punch
emjxmcutzz0_2-5-rgb_front we are going to up the indiscernible on that by adding in weights
emjxmcutzz0_3-5-rgb_front i am going to grab fives because this is going to be a cardiovascular workout as well as a strengthening workout
emjxmcutzz0_4-5-rgb_front let is go into a squat position so soften your knees put your hips back arms are up you are going to go cross the body front in a jab position
emjxmcutzz0_5-5-rgb_front you do not want to stretch your arms to a hundred percent straight just about
emjxmcutzz0_6-5-rgb_front so you going to keep that going exhale as you push out inhale as you come in
emjxmcutzz0_7-5-rgb_front pause and then take a punch which is going to go across your body turning the knee right and left exhale every time you go out
emjxmcutzz0_8-5-rgb_front and now we are going to change it and hold and just jab to one side so the other arm is up as if you were blocking your face
emjxmcutzz0_9-5-rgb_front about five more and
emmuwocugxs_0-8-rgb_front my name is anthony maddaloni and i am going to be talking about how to start a photography business
emmuwocugxs_1-8-rgb_front now one thing about starting a photography business is that you want to really seriously consider what you are doing
emmuwocugxs_10-8-rgb_front but if there is a way that you can make them minimal such as buying equipment that maybe has been used or equipment that is on sale because newer technologies have come out but you could still use that type of equipment for the genre of photography business that you start
emmuwocugxs_11-8-rgb_front so those are some aspects that you want to look at it
emmuwocugxs_12-8-rgb_front i really frown upon going out and spending a large amount of money on the biggest and the best new equipment to start a business that you have never done before
emmuwocugxs_13-8-rgb_front i can i can not think of a bigger mistake a person can potentially make
emmuwocugxs_14-8-rgb_front so really start out extremely small take on photography jobs that are really making you a profit of you know not so much at first just enough to almost break even and then start building upon that and building upon your client base
emmuwocugxs_15-8-rgb_front and this goes for any type of photography
emmuwocugxs_16-8-rgb_front the more specific you are the chances of you making are it are better
emmuwocugxs_17-8-rgb_front if you start a photography business specifically aimed at a certain clientele or a certain demographic your chances are better than just starting a photography business where you do everything from weddings to bar mitzvahs to baseball to soccer when you are all over the place there is nothing you can really concentrate on to being the best at that in your area
emmuwocugxs_18-8-rgb_front people are going to go to you when you are the only person that does certain type of events or photographs let is say it is dancing
emmuwocugxs_19-8-rgb_front i do not know i am just thinking off the top of my head let is say it is kids dancing
emmuwocugxs_2-8-rgb_front most people start out in photography as a hobby or something they really enjoy
emmuwocugxs_20-8-rgb_front you are the best kid photographer in town that does that
emmuwocugxs_21-8-rgb_front you are going to get all that business
emmuwocugxs_22-8-rgb_front so those are just some ways that i would start a small photography business
emmuwocugxs_3-8-rgb_front now this is sort of i do not know being a little you know you really want to look at it
emmuwocugxs_4-8-rgb_front do i want to start doing something i really enjoy as a pass time and start it in to a business because you might not really enjoy doing it so much anymore where it becomes a business
emmuwocugxs_5-8-rgb_front but on the other hand you might actually enjoy doing it more because you are getting paid to do something you enjoy
emmuwocugxs_6-8-rgb_front i mean i am trying to kind of make it a little bit comical but to be really honest with you it really gets to be that way sometimes for some photographers
emmuwocugxs_7-8-rgb_front where as they started out doing something they love and ended up actually hating it and just doing it for money and in the end i think sometimes that really shows
emmuwocugxs_8-8-rgb_front so it is really something you want to think about even before you begin doing anything
emmuwocugxs_9-8-rgb_front one thing about a photography business is that photography is extremely expensive so your start up fees are going to be very high
emxarfgokd0_0-8-rgb_front some illnesses that you may come across with your leopard gecko include tail loss
emxarfgokd0_1-8-rgb_front now tail loss is one of the most feared illnesses by a leopard gecko owner simply because especially if they are used for breeding or for show purposes because the tail that is lost they can regrow their tail but what regrows is not the same
emxarfgokd0_10-8-rgb_front in any sick reptile raise the temperatures it always helps
emxarfgokd0_11-8-rgb_front you also want to make sure they have plenty off food plenty of fresh water and a nice warm area but also a nice cool area to
emxarfgokd0_12-8-rgb_front now another health issue is shedding
emxarfgokd0_13-8-rgb_front a lot of times leopard geckos cannot properly shed
emxarfgokd0_14-8-rgb_front this is for several different reasons
emxarfgokd0_15-8-rgb_front sometimes the temperatures are too low
emxarfgokd0_16-8-rgb_front sometimes they lack vitamin a which is not something that is taken in in large amounts but it is something that is found in most reptile supplements
emxarfgokd0_17-8-rgb_front even in low dosages you just want to make sure that your leopard geckos is able to have at least a little bit once a week or so of a vitamin a mix
emxarfgokd0_18-8-rgb_front now another reason your leopard gecko may not be able to shed is the humidity may be too low
emxarfgokd0_19-8-rgb_front another reason would be parasites external parasites such as mites or ticks
emxarfgokd0_2-8-rgb_front it comes out in the shape more like its head
emxarfgokd0_20-8-rgb_front leopard geckos do not get this very often but it is something that can cause your leopard gecko to have trouble shedding
emxarfgokd0_21-8-rgb_front so carefully examine the body and make sure you do not see any little bugs
emxarfgokd0_22-8-rgb_front look carefully between the toes and in the folds of the skin
emxarfgokd0_23-8-rgb_front now also you would want to make sure that you have a humid shelter available
emxarfgokd0_24-8-rgb_front if you have this shelter available at all times you will not have a problem with shedding almost guaranteed
emxarfgokd0_25-8-rgb_front now this inability to shed and if it is not treated and taken care of it will cause the leopard gecko to become ill it will cause it to lose weight and it will become a little bit listless
emxarfgokd0_26-8-rgb_front now addition to becoming inactive and losing weigh if your leopard gecko is unable to shed it may also develop eye problems
emxarfgokd0_27-8-rgb_front it can cause infections on the digits especially in those little small areas like the fingers and toes and maybe even the tip of its tail
emxarfgokd0_28-8-rgb_front if skin is kept on there for an extended period of time it can cause an infection which can cause loss of the toes
emxarfgokd0_29-8-rgb_front now if you are having trouble helping your leopard gecko to shed you might want to try using a cotton swab with some peroxide that may help remove the skin
emxarfgokd0_3-8-rgb_front this is actually meant to be able to fool its predators because they are able to drop their tail they want to be able to distract their predator from their head and use their tail as a decoy which they can drop and escape at that point
emxarfgokd0_30-8-rgb_front you can also try lubricating it with like a eye lubrication
emxarfgokd0_31-8-rgb_front not necessarily the type that gets the redness out of your eyes but you want to make sure you get specifically eye lubricant
emxarfgokd0_32-8-rgb_front this is often a useful tool in removing attached shed from your leopard gecko
emxarfgokd0_4-8-rgb_front now what does grow back is also not colorful
emxarfgokd0_5-8-rgb_front it is most likely going to be white
emxarfgokd0_6-8-rgb_front not very pretty not for show
emxarfgokd0_7-8-rgb_front this can also compromise the health of your leopard gecko
emxarfgokd0_8-8-rgb_front a leopard gecko that is lost it is tail is going to be weak it is going to be stressed and your going to need to take special measure to make sure that your leopard gecko is going to make it through the loss of its tail
emxarfgokd0_9-8-rgb_front now a couple things you can do is you can quarantine it into a separate cage and you definitely want to raise the temperatures
entdoclhyyo_0-5-rgb_front hello
entdoclhyyo_2-5-rgb_front the first step to a room is to consider your largest spaces and the first space is your floor
entdoclhyyo_3-5-rgb_front what i have done in this room is select a rug that was purchased in dallas at rug shop
entdoclhyyo_4-5-rgb_front like to show you how to center that rug in your space
entdoclhyyo_5-5-rgb_front what i have done is measure this room and made a determination that i wanted this space pretty much open around the rug
entdoclhyyo_6-5-rgb_front so selected a rug that just pretty much sits in the center of the room
entdoclhyyo_7-5-rgb_front centering the medallion with the fireplace which is my focal point
entdoclhyyo_8-5-rgb_front now like to show you how to center that and easily install that rug
eodknzod2-o_0-8-rgb_front on preservation of your fence you might want to think of painting your fence every three years depending upon your environment
eodknzod2-o_1-8-rgb_front now touch up as needed
eodknzod2-o_10-8-rgb_front now we used a soft wood here which is pine
eodknzod2-o_11-8-rgb_front if you use a harder wood maybe one coat of primer one coat of paint will suffice
eodknzod2-o_12-8-rgb_front being the fact that this is a softer wood we put on one coat of primer and two coats of paint
eodknzod2-o_2-8-rgb_front make sure that you save a sample of the original paint
eodknzod2-o_3-8-rgb_front when you do your touch up the paint will match and it will look very lovely
eodknzod2-o_4-8-rgb_front now if you find that your fence is looking a little dingy in between your paintings you can easily get a pressure washer and pressure wash your fence to return it to your condition
eodknzod2-o_5-8-rgb_front another helpful tip in preserving your picket fence is to remove the dirt or any wet debris at the bottom of your fence
eodknzod2-o_6-8-rgb_front you wanna keep your bottom of your picket fence as dry as you possibly can in order to prevent rot
eodknzod2-o_7-8-rgb_front when you paint a fence it has two primary functions
eodknzod2-o_8-8-rgb_front the first is that it looks good
eodknzod2-o_9-8-rgb_front but the second is that it helps to preserve the wood to keep the outside from coming in
eqjqwybeupq_0-8-rgb_front alright when having a business dinner the business portion of the dinner does not actually start until after the entree is served
eqjqwybeupq_1-8-rgb_front and for lunches that would i mean basically you are not talking about several courses but the business portion would not start until the meal has been on the table
eqjqwybeupq_2-8-rgb_front so it is very very important that prior to that time you are not talking about business
eqjqwybeupq_3-8-rgb_front and this is proper etiquette you are talking about other things
eqjqwybeupq_4-8-rgb_front now you might be talking about things that are but you do not bring up the portion of business that this meeting is about until after the entree or the lunch has been served which means all the business papers that you have whether they are in a briefcase whether they are in a folder whether they are loosely brought about you must leave your business papers under the table until it is time to talk business
eqjqwybeupq_5-8-rgb_front you do not want them sitting on the table next to you you do not want them in your lap
eqjqwybeupq_6-8-rgb_front completely keep them out of sight until it is time to talk business
erf4ixbjcqy_0-9-rgb_front hello my name is scott and i am the owner of climb on
erf4ixbjcqy_1-9-rgb_front indoor rock climbing gym in wilmington north carolina

es5vtk3iov0_0-5-rgb_front hi i am james with jnc home repair
es5vtk3iov0_1-5-rgb_front today i am going to show you how to choose the right nail
es5vtk3iov0_15-5-rgb_front if you use these type of nails in a fence they are actually going to rust and they are not going to hold the pickets on there very well for a long term
es5vtk3iov0_16-5-rgb_front this is basically just another variety of a ring shank nail
es5vtk3iov0_17-5-rgb_front this is one that you would just hammer in using a hammer you would not really use a nail gun to apply these
es5vtk3iov0_18-5-rgb_front and then this is basically a little finish nail
es5vtk3iov0_19-5-rgb_front these are used more like for cabinets trim type things that you can actually see that the head is real real small and you will actually need a center punch to actually sink these in all the way and then you will actually be able to put wood filler over them and you will not ever ever be able to see the head of the nail

etbvdm_pty0_0-5-rgb_front hi i am tim gipson with some tips on bathroom plumbing
etbvdm_pty0_1-5-rgb_front now bathroom plumbing has three basic components
etbvdm_pty0_10-5-rgb_front what that trap does is actually it just traps some water in there
etbvdm_pty0_11-5-rgb_front and what this allows is it allows to cut any kind of waste odor that may come out of your sinks
etbvdm_pty0_12-5-rgb_front so if you have some strange odors coming out of either your shower drain or tub drain or your lavatory drains then you might want to check and make sure that you have a trap installed
etbvdm_pty0_13-5-rgb_front because that water just makes a barrier
etbvdm_pty0_14-5-rgb_front and that is the basic components
etbvdm_pty0_15-5-rgb_front then you look at your faucets
etbvdm_pty0_16-5-rgb_front you have different type of faucets
etbvdm_pty0_17-5-rgb_front in this case we have a single handle faucet you can have dual faucets and there are variant type of faucets that you can get
etbvdm_pty0_18-5-rgb_front and that can add a different type of style to your bathroom
etbvdm_pty0_19-5-rgb_front so i am tim gipson with some tips on bathroom plumbing
etbvdm_pty0_2-5-rgb_front you have your hot and cold water supply you have your drain and your vent system
etbvdm_pty0_3-5-rgb_front now with the drain and the vent system those work together
etbvdm_pty0_4-5-rgb_front and the drain lines actually go from your lavatories your shower drain tub drain and your toilet
etbvdm_pty0_5-5-rgb_front and go down to the sewer lines
etbvdm_pty0_6-5-rgb_front but with those drain lines are actually vent lines that are connected and go up through your walls out through your ceiling and to a roof vent
etbvdm_pty0_7-5-rgb_front without those vent lines the water when it would try to drain would actually create a suction and you would not be able to get any drain at all
etbvdm_pty0_8-5-rgb_front now with your drain lines when those are installed we have what we call a trap
etbvdm_pty0_9-5-rgb_front and what this is it is a one hundred and eighty degree shaped fitting that attaches the drain line and stands between it and your wall
evs51qz56a0_0-8-rgb_front i told you he was a frantic fool

evs51qz56a0_17-8-rgb_front for musicals for instance you may very well be ask to bring a prepared song pay attention to how many bars they ask you to sing sixteen or thirty two because if you sing too much they are going to cut you off before you get to your big finish
evs51qz56a0_18-8-rgb_front are you going to need to be prepared to dance
evs51qz56a0_19-8-rgb_front if so make sure that you have the right clothing to do that
evs51qz56a0_2-8-rgb_front well i guess i better figure out what that means before the audition
evs51qz56a0_20-8-rgb_front sometimes they will ask for a one minute monologue
evs51qz56a0_21-8-rgb_front that is just you reciting some speech from shakespeare for instance
evs51qz56a0_22-8-rgb_front where you are going to have to show that you can act all by yourself
evs51qz56a0_23-8-rgb_front then they will probably ask you to do some cold readings too to see how you work with other actors

f0clgejv5_k_2-5-rgb_front now this hair is pretty nice and it is nice and soft and it does not have any damage to it
f0clgejv5_k_3-5-rgb_front but damaged hair would usually look frizzy it would have the split ends on it
f0clgejv5_k_4-5-rgb_front you can see it a mile away
f0clgejv5_k_5-5-rgb_front it does not have anything to it it is just really hair that looks like it is hurting
f0clgejv5_k_6-5-rgb_front and the way you want to condition that hair is you might want to use something that moisturizes the hair a moisturizing mask
f0clgejv5_k_7-5-rgb_front do it once a week

f0cu-uaar8i_10-8-rgb_front all these chicken breast are all so juicy these are great and all we are going to do now is i am going to break up that rice a little bit
f0cu-uaar8i_11-8-rgb_front this would be great maybe if you had leftover white rice from chinese takeout not the fried rice but you can do stuff with that
f0cu-uaar8i_12-8-rgb_front but if you had leftover rice from that how easy is that you did not even have to cook it and all we are going to do with our soup is just pour it on top and kind of let it all mesh together
f0cu-uaar8i_2-8-rgb_front which we will do in the oven it is the baking part
f0cu-uaar8i_3-8-rgb_front let is just assemble i am going to spray down my dish just because it makes me sleep better at night just knowing that it is not going to stick
f0cu-uaar8i_4-8-rgb_front just hold it away from you and give it a good once over and i want to start with the rice let is put the rice in first
f0cu-uaar8i_5-8-rgb_front if you want to put in your chicken first i am not going to stop you whatever floats your boat like my dad will say
f0cu-uaar8i_6-8-rgb_front just piling on our rice put all of it why not the size of this dish it all depends on if i had more or less rice cooked in this or i have three chicken breast today
f0cu-uaar8i_7-8-rgb_front i could of had six or maybe where i had one and i am just cooking for myself i could of made this a much much smaller pan

f0cu-uaar8i_9-8-rgb_front let is get our chicken in next i am just going to put in there we will add in one more chicken breast shove it down in there like a little bed
f0ece9z6enc_1-8-rgb_front ok so first things first leather
f0ece9z6enc_10-8-rgb_front wipe a little color protector your wipe on there to make sure the bag is not really dark brown compared to the light brown everywhere else
f0ece9z6enc_11-8-rgb_front you also maybe maybe want some rain protection on every other bag that you have at home or anything else
f0ece9z6enc_12-8-rgb_front like this bag here or your fabrics
f0ece9z6enc_13-8-rgb_front fabrics are very important you can also store your bags in the thing that they came in so that you can zip it up save it up and just put it away
f0ece9z6enc_14-8-rgb_front that way its stored nice and neat bring it out of the bag still smells fresh
f0ece9z6enc_15-8-rgb_front its very important

f0ece9z6enc_7-8-rgb_front so if your going to try to protect your bag
f0ece9z6enc_8-8-rgb_front you do not want any discolor in any relative bag
f0ece9z6enc_9-8-rgb_front so you want to open it up somewhere where people normally do not see

f1495o0hage_1-8-rgb_front if you hoop towards the left your first hand is going to be your right hand
f1495o0hage_10-8-rgb_front once you are in lasso you want to try to actually grab the hoop and release
f1495o0hage_11-8-rgb_front this is going to give you a lot of control and it is going to make sure that you do not toss the hoop across the room
f1495o0hage_12_13-8-rgb_front let is try it again at your hip turning toward the direction you hoop in bringing the hoop up the hoop rolls across the thumb and into the palm of the hand
f1495o0hage_14-8-rgb_front then continuously rolls between the palm and the back of your hand in lasso
f1495o0hage_15-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that you are swinging your hoop on a nice horizontal plane keeping it over your head
f1495o0hage_16-8-rgb_front that looks great
f1495o0hage_17-8-rgb_front nice
f1495o0hage_2-8-rgb_front if you hoop towards the right your first hand will be your left hand
f1495o0hage_3-8-rgb_front since i hoop to the left i will start with my right hand hold the hoop at your hip
f1495o0hage_4-8-rgb_front you are going to slowly start to turn in the direction you hoop as as you bring the hoop up and in towards the chest and over the head
f1495o0hage_5-8-rgb_front now i will do it
f1495o0hage_6-8-rgb_front turn towards the left bring the hip in towards your chest over the head into lasso
f1495o0hage_7-8-rgb_front let me describe that a little bit more now
f1495o0hage_8-8-rgb_front again starting at the hip turn in the direction you hoop as bring the hand in towards the heart center over the head
f1495o0hage_9-8-rgb_front what happens with our hand up here is when we turn the hoop rolled across the thumb and into the palm of the hand into lasso

f2p-lvoavoi_6-5-rgb_front always stand up when addressing the judge and when your standing up let your arms flow naturally to your side as opposed to waiving your hands around and talking in an animated fashion
f2p-lvoavoi_7-5-rgb_front remember to be polite and always remember to make eye contact with the judge so the judge knows that you are speaking to him or her
f2p-lvoavoi_8-5-rgb_front that is how you address a judge in court

f4vlousky4c_16_17_18_19_20-8-rgb_front big drive sarah lets shoot for about four more good pace four three two one and back slow so basically from your hips up there is a lot of movement or a lot of core that is being engaged plus the large muscles of the back
f4vlousky4c_2-8-rgb_front sarah is going to demonstrate one of the many moves used to helping increase strength and muscle mass if that is what you are looking to do for volleyball specific
f4vlousky4c_21-8-rgb_front all of the small muscles that is encompass the shoulder and chest
f4vlousky4c_22-8-rgb_front this is greg with fitness for life and this concludes our weight training for volleyball
f56xdidatve_0-5-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson and what we are talking about right now is the way to make a proper pass in the offense
f56xdidatve_1-5-rgb_front one of the best passes you can use and one of the most effective passes is a chest pass
f56xdidatve_10-5-rgb_front now there is a couple mechanical things behind the chest pass
f56xdidatve_11-5-rgb_front one obviously first we are going to fake the ball
f56xdidatve_12-5-rgb_front so you always want to fake the pass off then make the pass
f56xdidatve_13-5-rgb_front whenever you make a pass you want to try to keep your defender as far away as possible
f56xdidatve_14-5-rgb_front if i am defending the ball and kyle is trying to throw the ball to that direction we do not want him to throw with his right hand because he is going to come through the defense
f56xdidatve_15-5-rgb_front instead we want him to throw his pass with the outside hand away from his defender
f56xdidatve_16-5-rgb_front same thing on the reverse side
f56xdidatve_17-5-rgb_front so you are going to throw strong hand pass or weak hand pass
f56xdidatve_18-5-rgb_front the other important thing is you are going to step when you pass it
f56xdidatve_19-5-rgb_front so you are going to fake and you are going to step with your pass
f56xdidatve_2-5-rgb_front now it is called a chest pass for a reason
f56xdidatve_20-5-rgb_front you are going to pop it off with your fingers just almost like you were making a shot
f56xdidatve_21-5-rgb_front you are going to pop the pass
f56xdidatve_22-5-rgb_front you are not going to throw it and float the pass
f56xdidatve_23-5-rgb_front you are probably going to have to take one more step back
f56xdidatve_24_25_26_27-5-rgb_front we are going to show you at full speed here how to do some chest passes go all right you are good good
f56xdidatve_28-5-rgb_front all right so that is the proper way to make a chest pass
f56xdidatve_29-5-rgb_front step with it pop the ball and when you catch it catch the ball in here in the chest area
f56xdidatve_3-5-rgb_front you do not throw it at their head and you do not throw it at their feet
f56xdidatve_30-5-rgb_front that is a chest pass
f56xdidatve_4-5-rgb_front instead you are throwing it at their chest
f56xdidatve_5-5-rgb_front the reason you want to throw it in the chest area is because of the fact that that is where your hands most typically go
f56xdidatve_6-5-rgb_front that is also where you want to catch to shoot
f56xdidatve_7-5-rgb_front that is where you want to catch to pass
f56xdidatve_8-5-rgb_front everything works out of this base area
f56xdidatve_9-5-rgb_front so whenever you make a pass you usually want to try to get it in the chest area
f5aacx9r5k0_0-5-rgb_front okay now we are going to do the rim of the toilet which is the only thing we have not done
f5aacx9r5k0_1-5-rgb_front the inside is all nice and clean we are just going to do the top rim
f5aacx9r5k0_10-5-rgb_front again you want to do this two or three times with a different paper cloths
f5aacx9r5k0_11-5-rgb_front do not ever reuse the paper cloth
f5aacx9r5k0_12-5-rgb_front you are not going down into the basin you are just doing the lip right here
f5aacx9r5k0_13-5-rgb_front okay
f5aacx9r5k0_14-5-rgb_front and another reason why i do not use cloth for this is because the cloth would you know you will drop a corner of it will go down into the toilet and get and it is just more difficult
f5aacx9r5k0_15-5-rgb_front so also do not forget to get the back part right here
f5aacx9r5k0_17-5-rgb_front because we have not done that at all
f5aacx9r5k0_18-5-rgb_front we have done the hinges back here but we have not actually done the part that links the toilet to this piece here
f5aacx9r5k0_19-5-rgb_front so just clean that up
f5aacx9r5k0_2-5-rgb_front this is where we want to use the paper because again this is one of the dirtier parts of the toilet
f5aacx9r5k0_20-5-rgb_front and that is it your toilet is cleaned
f5aacx9r5k0_21-5-rgb_front but just make sure you go over this area a couple with two or three different pieces of toilet paper kitchen paper and then put it in your plastic bag cause that is not it is harmful to flush that down the toilet
f5aacx9r5k0_3-5-rgb_front so you just want to get a little bit of disinfectant on your cloth
f5aacx9r5k0_4-5-rgb_front again even though we are using this water over and over it is got disinfectant in it
f5aacx9r5k0_5-5-rgb_front so do not worry about contaminating that water
f5aacx9r5k0_6-5-rgb_front all right
f5aacx9r5k0_7-5-rgb_front so then let is go ahead with our disinfectant cloth and you are going to wipe the top of your basin here
f5aacx9r5k0_8-5-rgb_front now this is where you are going to see you know yellow urine that is been sitting there
f5aacx9r5k0_9-5-rgb_front so you want to wipe that really well
f5ziuqnrwnc_0-5-rgb_front dixon gillette in three two one
f5ziuqnrwnc_1-5-rgb_front okay
f5ziuqnrwnc_10-5-rgb_front once you are satisfied with its length again and as you can see you have just completed parallel track building
f5ziuqnrwnc_11-5-rgb_front now from there we can build a switch
f5ziuqnrwnc_12-5-rgb_front to build a switch we are going to want to push our single track icon or t on the keyboard and we are going to want to drag our mouse pointer over the edge of our parallel track
f5ziuqnrwnc_13-5-rgb_front now you are going to want to click once there and drag this to an interior portion of your other track
f5ziuqnrwnc_14-5-rgb_front now as you can see you have a yellow indicator there and that is telling you essentially that you are building on an interior portion of your track
f5ziuqnrwnc_15-5-rgb_front so what we are going to do is once we are happy with each position we are going to again and it will build the switch
f5ziuqnrwnc_16-5-rgb_front and now as you see in its place there is now a signal so now trains can utilize both of these tracks and your routing will become all the more efficient
f5ziuqnrwnc_2-5-rgb_front now we are going to talk about laying parallel track and building switches
f5ziuqnrwnc_3-5-rgb_front most of the time you are going to need to build parallel track because you are just going to be having too many operations being conducted at your city depot centers
f5ziuqnrwnc_4-5-rgb_front so to lay parallel track we are going to select our double track icon here or push d on the keyboard
f5ziuqnrwnc_5-5-rgb_front again you can see it highlights the track that you currently own
f5ziuqnrwnc_6-5-rgb_front again you are going to see your mouse pointer change into your circle colors depending on the type of operation that you are performing
f5ziuqnrwnc_7-5-rgb_front so to begin laying parallel track you are going to want to bring your mouse pointer directly beside the track that you want to lay and we will just zoom it a little bit here
f5ziuqnrwnc_8-5-rgb_front and as you can see here we now have a green chevron
f5ziuqnrwnc_9-5-rgb_front now to begin laying the track on your mouse once to begin the start point and then simply drag your track alongside the other track
f8eqi8e-6q4_0-5-rgb_front in this section we are going to discuss some methods you can use in dealing with tough customers
f8eqi8e-6q4_10-5-rgb_front that crosses a completely different line so you have to stay calm stay professional most times just by doing that and using the proper professional tone you can defuse a situation and you will calm a customer down
f8eqi8e-6q4_2-5-rgb_front a very important thing to remember when you are dealing with a tough customer and this is a very difficult thing to do stay calm
f8eqi8e-6q4_3-5-rgb_front the customer comes at you with a very upset loud tone do not match the customers tone
f8eqi8e-6q4_4-5-rgb_front the customer is yelling at you
f8eqi8e-6q4_5-5-rgb_front maintain a regular tone of professionalism just general conversation much like i am doing right now
f8eqi8e-6q4_6-5-rgb_front in my experience people will bring their tone down to match the others persons tone rather than trying to escalate it
f8eqi8e-6q4_7-5-rgb_front if you stay calm you can help that customer stay calm
f8eqi8e-6q4_8-5-rgb_front the worst thing that i can do is to become angry right along with them
f8eqi8e-6q4_9-5-rgb_front then this does not become just an issue about what the customer wants you to solve or question that the customer has then it becomes a very personal argument
f9ulog0q9jk_0-9-rgb_front now we are going to talk about the grapevine
f9ulog0q9jk_1-9-rgb_front the grapevine is a traveling step
f9ulog0q9jk_10-9-rgb_front if you wanted to do the grapevine in place you can also do right to left so you can step to the side cross back side cross front step side cross back side cross front side cross back side cross front side cross back side cross front
f9ulog0q9jk_2-9-rgb_front you can use it to travel side to side or you can use it to travel diagonally forward or diagonally back
f9ulog0q9jk_3-9-rgb_front so starting with your right foot you are going to step to the side
f9ulog0q9jk_4-9-rgb_front then you are going to cross back
f9ulog0q9jk_5-9-rgb_front then you are going to open out to the side and then you are going to cross front
f9ulog0q9jk_6-9-rgb_front then you are going to open out to the side cross back and repeat
f9ulog0q9jk_7-9-rgb_front step out cross back step out cross front
f9ulog0q9jk_8-9-rgb_front now we are going to try the grapevine a little bit faster
f9ulog0q9jk_9-9-rgb_front out back out front
fbso2ja6xpe_0-5-rgb_front we are talking about boots
fbso2ja6xpe_1-5-rgb_front boots are probably the most important thing you want to choose as far as snowboarding goes i think because your feet is what connects to the board
fbso2ja6xpe_2-5-rgb_front when you go to a shop you should go and by a package so that you get fitted best your board boots and bindings but the boots are very very touchy because people like you have to try them out pretty much and they take time to break in there is all types of different kinds pretty much there is soft medium and hard and there are different lacing systems now
fc1l5gtpmku_0-8-rgb_front i wanted to take some time in this series of videos to talk about controlling ones caffeine intake
fc1l5gtpmku_1-8-rgb_front and the concept of refined sugar is actually being a drug in itself
fc1l5gtpmku_10-8-rgb_front but for somebody who chooses to go drug free or chooses to go off adhd medication caffeine can quickly become a disruptive force
fc1l5gtpmku_11-8-rgb_front it can make you too speedy
fc1l5gtpmku_12-8-rgb_front it can cause you to go beyond a point where you are focused due to the stimulation of the caffeine
fc1l5gtpmku_13-8-rgb_front and head into a point where you are plain stimulated
fc1l5gtpmku_14-8-rgb_front refined sugar can also have this effect on somebody with adhd
fc1l5gtpmku_15-8-rgb_front and it can cause complications for somebody who is trying to manage adhd without the use of medication
fc1l5gtpmku_16_17_18-8-rgb_front refined sugar is also in it is own way a stimulant and can be over stimulating to a person with adhd thereby exacerbating negative symptoms
fc1l5gtpmku_2-8-rgb_front caffeine is not only a popular drug with the population as a whole especially is
fc1l5gtpmku_3-8-rgb_front we here in america become more and more over worked and get less and less sleep
fc1l5gtpmku_4-8-rgb_front and have so many more things to cram in at the course of the day
fc1l5gtpmku_5-8-rgb_front caffeine becomes a fall back just as refined sugar does
fc1l5gtpmku_6-8-rgb_front caffeine is a drug even though it is present in everything from coffee and soda
fc1l5gtpmku_7-8-rgb_front all the way to coffee ice cream coffee flavored yogurt caffeinated water energy drinks
fc1l5gtpmku_8-8-rgb_front caffeine can be a point for somebody with adhd to fall back on
fc1l5gtpmku_9-8-rgb_front and indeed there is benefit in caffeine helping to focus somebody helping to sort of eliminate some of the not eliminate but control some of the negative symptoms of adhd

fdweetaw9sc_2-1-rgb_front he is caught it he secured it
fdweetaw9sc_3-1-rgb_front chris is coming down field he knows to execute the stiff arm move and once he gets upfield he is got to draw a direct line to the end zone
fdweetaw9sc_4-1-rgb_front now once he gets here we will emulate that the cone is maybe another defender
fdweetaw9sc_5-1-rgb_front he is got to take another path but once he gets clear of that man he gets straight back up
fdweetaw9sc_6-1-rgb_front if there is another man he clears that as well and then he draws his line straight back to the end zone
fdweetaw9sc_7-1-rgb_front if he continues to run from sideline to sideline the defenders will be able to either cut off his pattern cut him off in the backfield wherever he may be running or just end up tackling him
ffwwrrhqste_0-5-rgb_front now i am going to show you how to prepare your stones

ffwwrrhqste_8-5-rgb_front any of these corners would get in to any corner on type of stone that you have
ffwwrrhqste_9-5-rgb_front then you would just simply rinse it with warm water

fgruen1-v4u_2-5-rgb_front now if you have a project or component of your project where you have end grain that needs to be plane on the block plane is probably the best tool to use for this
fgruen1-v4u_3-5-rgb_front now if i were just to come in here with my block plane and just start planing i would blow out this end of my project and it would just chip off and splinter and it would look real bad
fgruen1-v4u_4-5-rgb_front what we are going to do is we are going to use our block plane and we are going to plane this way about to where we reach half way point and then we are going to come around the other side and plane the other way
fgruen1-v4u_5-5-rgb_front this is going to ensure that we do not blow out the end of our project
fgruen1-v4u_6-5-rgb_front now planing end grains can be a bit more time consuming and a bit more aggravating but if you take your time you will get a real nice end result

flmh3vqitb0_0-5-rgb_front hi i am tim gipson and i am going to talk to you about how to use a clothes dryer
flmh3vqitb0_1-5-rgb_front now before we put our clothes in the dryer the first thing we want to do is we want to get the lint trap out and we want to run our fingers or this surface and you want to make sure that you remove any lint
flmh3vqitb0_2-5-rgb_front it is very important to do this every time otherwise air will not flow properly through your dryer and your clothes will not get dry
flmh3vqitb0_3-5-rgb_front or it is going to take a lot more energy to dry your clothes
flmh3vqitb0_4-5-rgb_front so we can replace that lint trap
flmh3vqitb0_5-5-rgb_front we can put our clothes in and also you want to think you want to be mindful of the capacity of your dryer
flmh3vqitb0_6-5-rgb_front dryers can come in a regular capacity a heavy duty capacity or an extra heavy duty
flmh3vqitb0_7-5-rgb_front and that will determine how many clothes you can actually load in there and properly dry in a cycle
flmh3vqitb0_8-5-rgb_front so once we get our clothes loaded in there and close the door man you want to make sure that you choose your right temperature
flmh3vqitb0_9-5-rgb_front a lot of your dryers will come with the temperatures that you can put on low heat for delicates to a medium heat for knits or permanent press all the way up to high heat for your cotton products that are a lot in your regular clothes

fohno-685bw_1-5-rgb_front of course you can buy a hoop
fohno-685bw_10-5-rgb_front you may even want to straighten that out a bit using your pliers
fohno-685bw_11-5-rgb_front now to make it in a curve shape you can either curve it around something that is round if you have issues with the shape or you can just kind of grab your wire and keep twisting to make that circular shape
fohno-685bw_12-5-rgb_front when you are finished you will have a hoop shape much like this
fohno-685bw_2-5-rgb_front they sell them in craft stores and they look very similar to this
fohno-685bw_3-5-rgb_front as you can see the form is very simple and we can do it on our own for free
fohno-685bw_4-5-rgb_front we are going to take a inch and a half to inches piece of wire
fohno-685bw_5-5-rgb_front it is got to be a strong wire
fohno-685bw_6-5-rgb_front not one that is going to bend really easily
fohno-685bw_7-5-rgb_front you are going to grab the piece of wire at the very end
fohno-685bw_8-5-rgb_front this time you are probably going to make a medium size loop
fohno-685bw_9-5-rgb_front using that same wrist turning method you are going to bring the wire just till the end touches your main part of the wire
fprycdeavvk_0-8-rgb_front to buy you time to make the assailant is eyes tear up we or just you know run away breaking the nose is a very effective womens self defense move
fprycdeavvk_1-8-rgb_front to break the nose most people think you come straight in but that is the way the nose is built to take an impact it is straight in it is a triangle so you do not really want to come straight in rather you want to go side to side
fprycdeavvk_2-8-rgb_front so from the side of the nose strike here or the other side strike here boom boom
fprycdeavvk_3-8-rgb_front this will cause their eyes to tear up momentarily blinding them which will allow you to run away or follow up with another move
fprycdeavvk_4-8-rgb_front once again side to side side to side

fqqii37hcq0_0-5-rgb_front the reason for which you need to buy a mostly customers buy the aftermarket unit is for simple reasons
fqqii37hcq0_1-5-rgb_front sometimes they do want to upgrade their systems and especially if you want to add an ipod to the stock radios
fqqii37hcq0_2-5-rgb_front they usually the stock radios do not have these features available
fqqii37hcq0_3-5-rgb_front on when you buy and after market radio a like i told you before they are equip already there
fqqii37hcq0_4-5-rgb_front also when you want to do a big system like on add a two woofers you want more base in your system
fqqii37hcq0_5-5-rgb_front it is kind of hard to do it when you have a stock radio because they do not usually have a the features for them like a radio like this they already have it
fqqii37hcq0_6-5-rgb_front if you look at it like i said again they have the inputs for it so that make it easier for us to be able to hook a big system to them
fqqii37hcq0_7-5-rgb_front also the sound quality it is a lot better than just having a stock radio
fqqii37hcq0_8-5-rgb_front if stock radio is the radio that come from the manufacture from the dealer so the basically what they have they only have the am fm and cd player
fqqii37hcq0_9-5-rgb_front that is all it is they do not have any type of a features that you can add to them so if you want to upgrade this radio you actually need to the dealer and the dealer charge so much that a customer instead of a spending that much money on that they can actually save a lot of money and get something that is probably is going to do a lot better job with a lot less money
fqslcgxoreu_0-5-rgb_front okay in this segment going to look at good holes to play in and what makes a good hole for freestyler kayaking
fqslcgxoreu_1_2-5-rgb_front looking at this hole just behind me this is a nice hole for freestyle kayaking it has a pretty foam pile which means that going to be a nice deep hole
fqslcgxoreu_3-5-rgb_front i also look at the upstream face of the water so the water dropping down toward that foam should have a pretty low angle to it
fqslcgxoreu_4-5-rgb_front with a nice low angle i can have less edge on my kayak to be stable
fqslcgxoreu_5-5-rgb_front what else looking for is that there is a continuation of current through the foam pile
fqslcgxoreu_6-5-rgb_front if i have a big sticky foam pile going to keep me too much in that hole going to make it hard to get to the top of it
fqslcgxoreu_7-5-rgb_front but if i have some current flowing through the foam pile going to allow me to do a lot of freestyle moves
fqslcgxoreu_8-5-rgb_front looking for the downstream corners of the hole as well the downstream corners are each end of the hole so right about here would be one downstream corner and downstream of the middle part that allows me to get out of the hole and also spin back into the hole pretty easily
fqslcgxoreu_9-5-rgb_front if those are upstream getting more into a bad hole it
fsebzzjzg0a_0-5-rgb_front hello i am sifu mallon with the clearwater kung fu center
fsebzzjzg0a_1-5-rgb_front this is kung fu for health
fsebzzjzg0a_10-5-rgb_front again when your jump kicking you are goal is to get your kicks head or above that is the reason you are jumping to kick higher
fsebzzjzg0a_11-5-rgb_front okay going into the combination for you quick
fsebzzjzg0a_12-5-rgb_front i step one double
fsebzzjzg0a_13-5-rgb_front again i step one double
fsebzzjzg0a_14-5-rgb_front different angle for you
fsebzzjzg0a_15-5-rgb_front i step one heel kick step down double jump heel kick
fsebzzjzg0a_16-5-rgb_front this is heel kick double jump heel kick
fsebzzjzg0a_2-5-rgb_front this how to is on jump kick this is called heel kick double jump heel kick
fsebzzjzg0a_3-5-rgb_front okay so the heel kick just demonstrating it for you is a hinging kick
fsebzzjzg0a_4-5-rgb_front this is where your knee lifts and pushes out
fsebzzjzg0a_5-5-rgb_front okay now we are using this kick on three different actions
fsebzzjzg0a_6-5-rgb_front the first kick is just kind of like a set up for your timing
fsebzzjzg0a_7-5-rgb_front so to start it right you just keep your hands on by your side you step heel kick
fsebzzjzg0a_8-5-rgb_front step down now your left knee is going to lift then instead of just tucking your leg like this okay for a normal jump you are going to throw your left foot out and heel kick
fsebzzjzg0a_9-5-rgb_front as soon as you feel your left foot at the height of its action you are going to jump and heel kick with your right foot land
fsfyt1i8xq0_0-3-rgb_front hi
fsfyt1i8xq0_2-3-rgb_front this game is called i need a savior
fsfyt1i8xq0_3-3-rgb_front one person will be the devil and another person will be jesus
fsfyt1i8xq0_4-3-rgb_front the devil goes around tagging other people
fsfyt1i8xq0_5-3-rgb_front when someone get tagged by the devil in order to be unfrozen they need to call on jesus so they say i need a savior
fsfyt1i8xq0_6-3-rgb_front i need a savior

fstkscmbx00_0-4-rgb_front gina kennedy another pose to transition to from your halfway or lunge is a lunge twist
fstkscmbx00_1-4-rgb_front we are going to have faith demonstrate that for us right now
fstkscmbx00_11-4-rgb_front beautiful
fstkscmbx00_12-4-rgb_front now she wants to keep her hips square and keep this knee from flaring out so drawing the knee in
fstkscmbx00_13-4-rgb_front good
fstkscmbx00_14-4-rgb_front then she presses into that block and reaches up through her fingertips and opens up through her heart and comes into that twist just a little bit deeper
fstkscmbx00_15-4-rgb_front good
fstkscmbx00_16-4-rgb_front the whole time engaging this back leg and pressing through her heel
fstkscmbx00_17-4-rgb_front good
fstkscmbx00_18-4-rgb_front lengthening through the crown of her head
fstkscmbx00_19-4-rgb_front good
fstkscmbx00_2-4-rgb_front so she is going to come into her halfway lunge
fstkscmbx00_20-4-rgb_front and then when she is ready lowering her hand back down to her block and bringing her knee back down
fstkscmbx00_3-4-rgb_front we are going to have her use her blocks extending her to make the floor just a little bit more accessible
fstkscmbx00_4-4-rgb_front good
fstkscmbx00_5-4-rgb_front so she is going to curl her back toes under and lift up through her back knee
fstkscmbx00_6-4-rgb_front good
fstkscmbx00_7-4-rgb_front pressing into her heel and squeezing though her thigh
fstkscmbx00_8-4-rgb_front good
fstkscmbx00_9-4-rgb_front she is going to press into her left hand inhale and rotate her torso towards her knee and reach her right arm up to the sky
ftutlrq7014_0-8-rgb_front today we have been talking about how to measure your bra size
ftutlrq7014_1-8-rgb_front the reason a bra size is so important is because it keeps the breast tissue from breaking down too quickly
ftutlrq7014_10-8-rgb_front for a bigger cup size i do recommend an underwire
ftutlrq7014_11-8-rgb_front it is going to hold you in place better and it is going to keep your whole body in better condition
ftutlrq7014_12-8-rgb_front if the weight of your front is moving around too much your back is going to start hurting
ftutlrq7014_13-8-rgb_front so you want an underwire to lift you hold you into that place and have a firm material that is not going to let you move
ftutlrq7014_2-8-rgb_front on that note you need a sports bra
ftutlrq7014_3-8-rgb_front what a sports bra does is it holds you in place so it does not force your breast tissue to break down faster while you are doing high endurance activity and it also keeps the sweat away from your body instead of breaking down your everyday bras with excess moisture
ftutlrq7014_4-8-rgb_front so to find a sports bra for you first you need to start with the kind of activity you are doing
ftutlrq7014_5-8-rgb_front if you are doing low impact walking golfing there is a great donna karan bra it is called the golf bra
ftutlrq7014_6-8-rgb_front it is underwire and it runs in cup and band size
ftutlrq7014_7-8-rgb_front i would always recommend that until you start getting into jogging running tennis anything that is high endurance and you are going to be moving around a lot more
ftutlrq7014_8-8-rgb_front for a smaller cup size you can get away with using just a regular sports bra that pulls over your head as long as the band is snug
ftutlrq7014_9-8-rgb_front if it is too loose on the bottom you might as well not be wearing it
fu_eliq7e8e_0-4-rgb_front ok let is look at how to change the battery in an in the ear hearing aid
fu_eliq7e8e_1-4-rgb_front each hearing aid will have what we call a battery door
fu_eliq7e8e_10-4-rgb_front some hearing aid battery doors have it marked in color and some it is just etched into the battery door
fu_eliq7e8e_11-4-rgb_front for this hearing aid the battery door helps determine the orientation of the hearing aid
fu_eliq7e8e_12-4-rgb_front if you look at this battery door there is a small ridge on the bottom of the battery door that ridge is designed to accommodate the ring that is on the bottom of the battery
fu_eliq7e8e_13-4-rgb_front so that helps me know that the ring slides into that ridge
fu_eliq7e8e_14-4-rgb_front then you close the door and you need to make sure the door is closed securely because that will generally activate the hearing aid
fu_eliq7e8e_2-4-rgb_front you can see the battery door here on the surface of this hearing aid and its got a little lever
fu_eliq7e8e_3-4-rgb_front put your fingernail under that lever and use that to open the battery door
fu_eliq7e8e_4_5-4-rgb_front once you have the battery door open to remove the battery you can just lift it out for some people who have larger fingers or may have arthritis the hearing aids can be a little tricky to work with because they are very tiny and sometimes people you can get little devices that have a magnet on the end of them and that just lifts the hearing aid battery out for you
fu_eliq7e8e_6-4-rgb_front now to put the hearing aid battery in the hearing aid you need to get the battery in the correct orientation
fu_eliq7e8e_7-4-rgb_front all hearing aid batteries are pill shaped and if you look at one side of the battery you will see a plus sign
fu_eliq7e8e_8-4-rgb_front on the other side of the battery you will see a ring
fu_eliq7e8e_9-4-rgb_front if you look on the battery door you will see a plus sign etched in the battery door
fw1gcmu_joc_1-5-rgb_front the lemon sugar is one step in the process of making sure that your henna develops nicely and you get a good rich color
fw1gcmu_joc_2-5-rgb_front the main purpose of the lemon sugar is to seal the henna on and to have this stick on as long as you possibly can have it there
fw1gcmu_joc_3-5-rgb_front the longer the henna stays on the skin the darker it will eventually be and the longer it will last
fw1gcmu_joc_4-5-rgb_front the other things you can do to keep it is if you rub a little oil over your skin before you go swimming or go in a chlorinated pool or do dishes anything where you are going to be emerged in water for a long time
fw1gcmu_joc_5-5-rgb_front just put a little bit of olive oil tea tree oil also works
fw1gcmu_joc_6-5-rgb_front the other main thing to know is that anti bacterial hand jells will actually make the henna fad faster as i have learned from experience
fwoqpbc3kyy_6-5-rgb_front so the weight of the line bends the rod the rod slings the line out and your cast
fwoqpbc3kyy_7-5-rgb_front we call this the part cast pick up back cast pause forward cast and presentation
fwoqpbc3kyy_8-5-rgb_front the part cast

fwi7va17ouq_0-9-rgb_front hello my name is tom brintzenhofe a certified master mechanic from reading pennsylvania
fwi7va17ouq_1-9-rgb_front today we are going to talk about how to know when you replace a fan thermostat
fwi7va17ouq_18-9-rgb_front pull it out
fwi7va17ouq_19-9-rgb_front take your new one screw it right back in put your connector back on
fwi7va17ouq_2-9-rgb_front just for clarity there is no fan thermostat
fwi7va17ouq_20-9-rgb_front fill it back up with coolant
fwi7va17ouq_21-9-rgb_front run it to about a hundred and ninety five degrees
fwi7va17ouq_22-9-rgb_front about two hundred and ten degrees if it is an electric fan it will turn on
fwi7va17ouq_23-9-rgb_front under that it will not turn on til that point but just make sure that you keep your hands away from the fan
fwi7va17ouq_24-9-rgb_front you do not want to sit in there and try and turn it thinking it does not work cause it it turns on on it is own
fwi7va17ouq_25-9-rgb_front and that can cause a bad day
fwi7va17ouq_26-9-rgb_front the other fans you have you have a clutch fan that is that is also a spring
fwi7va17ouq_3-9-rgb_front there is either a thermostat that controls the flow of coolant through the engine or there is a thermostat that will i mean a coolant sensor that will turn on an electric fan
fwi7va17ouq_4-9-rgb_front but no fan thermostat
fwi7va17ouq_5-9-rgb_front if you need to replace your thermostat it is usually in the thermostat right behind the thermostat housing
fwi7va17ouq_6-9-rgb_front a couple of bolts two or three hoses not real hard to change
fwxpecaj2ma_1-5-rgb_front so let is begin with the basics
fwxpecaj2ma_10-5-rgb_front as you can see the milk has expanded a lot
fwxpecaj2ma_11-5-rgb_front there are a few bubbles here that you want to get rid of
fwxpecaj2ma_12-5-rgb_front the best way to do that is to tap the milk a little bit down on your table
fwxpecaj2ma_13-5-rgb_front there you go
fwxpecaj2ma_14-5-rgb_front the milk should always look very tight without any bubbles and firm
fwxpecaj2ma_2-5-rgb_front in order to make a great tasting cappuccino you have to make sure that you steam the milk properly
fwxpecaj2ma_3-5-rgb_front we are just going to fill up the pitcher through because it is going to expand in the steaming process
fwxpecaj2ma_4-5-rgb_front before you start steaming it is very important to open the valve to the steam wand because there is going to be residue water in the steam wand
fwxpecaj2ma_5-5-rgb_front then you place the steam wand a little bit beneath the surface of the milk to heat up the milk
fwxpecaj2ma_6-5-rgb_front then you want to let a little bit of air in and you want to make sure that the milk is swirling and you are slowly moving the pitcher down
fwxpecaj2ma_7-5-rgb_front do not let too much air in
fwxpecaj2ma_8-5-rgb_front otherwise it will tend to bubble
fwxpecaj2ma_9-5-rgb_front and the moment it starts feeling warm on your hand that is when you should stop
fxytx1euyoy_3-8-rgb_front and you need to know which is which
fxytx1euyoy_4-8-rgb_front you need to know your horse again and know what your horse prefers and what your horse prefers that you not do and take it from there
f_ozd0p0ysk_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to talk about advanced encaustic painting
f_ozd0p0ysk_2-5-rgb_front let is take a look at this painting that incorporates some of the things we talked about so far
f_ozd0p0ysk_3-5-rgb_front for instance you can see the fact that i have put kleenex again into the wax and painted around the wax with some of that iridescent paint used some of the round stylus points in here
f_ozd0p0ysk_4-5-rgb_front but there is actually another product down here i wanted you to see
f_ozd0p0ysk_5-5-rgb_front and that is these sections that have raised wax areas here and these are called wax sheets
f_ozd0p0ysk_6-5-rgb_front these wax sheets come in different sizes different dimensions and i think craft people use these to decorate candles
f_ozd0p0ysk_7-5-rgb_front i think that is one of the purposes of these
f_ozd0p0ysk_8-5-rgb_front but i found that i like to put these into the wax paintings because it adds some different dimension and it is let is say if i am working on something i might take a wax stick like this to stick them in place so they do not move around while i am trying to do something with them
f_ozd0p0ysk_9-5-rgb_front and a lot of times i will just take a tool and melt it through and make a pattern on top of the sheet
fadsfhcblhi_1-8-rgb_front a twice burnt match
fadsfhcblhi_10-8-rgb_front now it looks like you are just going to cool it down but in reality you are just going to throw it down between your legs onto the floor
fadsfhcblhi_2-8-rgb_front for this you need a match you need a knife and you need a marker
fadsfhcblhi_3-8-rgb_front this is a really old staple of restaurant magic usually it is done with paper matches
fadsfhcblhi_4-8-rgb_front i took it a kind of step further and carved up a wooden match so it resembles a burnt match because as the match burns it eats away at the wood
fadsfhcblhi_5-8-rgb_front so we want to emulate that by carving the corners of the matchstick away so starting at the head of the match just carve downwards about a quarter away down the matchstick until you have a kind of a shape that looks like a burnt match
fadsfhcblhi_6-8-rgb_front then take the marker and color the head of the matchstick and most of what you carved
fadsfhcblhi_7-8-rgb_front see because it is now rough and uneven the color is not going straight down it is kind of just grabbing corners and edges of the stick
fadsfhcblhi_8-8-rgb_front when you are done with that you take your pretend burnt match put it in the crutch of your thumb like this
fadsfhcblhi_9-8-rgb_front hold another match strike the first match make sure you get at least a quarter of it burnt blow it out
fatbgdrp9ni_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about black tea the most commonly consumed tea in the world
fatbgdrp9ni_1-8-rgb_front black tea you find that in your iced teas at restaurants
fatbgdrp9ni_10-8-rgb_front so one of the ways around that was to oxidize the tea which took out almost all of the moisture leaving about three percent in the tea
fatbgdrp9ni_11-8-rgb_front this resulted in a product that was easy to transport and still very tasty once it got back to the mainland of europe
fatbgdrp9ni_12-8-rgb_front so that is why traditionally today in europe most people drink black tea
fatbgdrp9ni_13-8-rgb_front black tea is most commonly produced in india and sri lanka
fatbgdrp9ni_14-8-rgb_front sri lanka exports more black tea than any other country in the world and it goes primarily into the middle east and into russia
fatbgdrp9ni_15-8-rgb_front the indians drink a lot of black tea and they produce a lot of black tea
fatbgdrp9ni_16-8-rgb_front but they do not export as much because they like to drink it as well
fatbgdrp9ni_17-8-rgb_front it is been said that if the indians each drank one extra cup of black tea a day they would become a net importer of teas over time
fatbgdrp9ni_18-8-rgb_front now let is go ahead and taste this tea it looks like it is ready
fatbgdrp9ni_19-8-rgb_front i am going to pour it out
fatbgdrp9ni_20-8-rgb_front you will see right from the start you will see that is a very dark red cup
fatbgdrp9ni_21-8-rgb_front the chinese actually even call black tea red tea because they think the color is more reddish than black
fatbgdrp9ni_22-8-rgb_front this is what most people know in the united states as tea
fatbgdrp9ni_23-8-rgb_front when we do classes on tea this is what people say oh finally we are getting to the tea tea
fatbgdrp9ni_24-8-rgb_front so here it is let is taste it
fatbgdrp9ni_25-8-rgb_front it is got nice strong notes
fatbgdrp9ni_26-8-rgb_front very tannic taste it is got a good mouth feel to it it is something that kind of lingers in your mouth for a long period of time due to the essential oils
fatbgdrp9ni_27-8-rgb_front it is really what people think of when they think of tea
fatbgdrp9ni_8-8-rgb_front so black teas came into being when the british east indies company and the dutch east indies company were trying to get tea out of china and into europe
fatbgdrp9ni_9-8-rgb_front they found that the green teas tended to spoil during the long voyage
fadlsynd2tk_0-5-rgb_front ok i am going to give gary in this segment a lob serve a series of lob serves
fadlsynd2tk_1-5-rgb_front now the lob serve is much tougher to return if it is executed well cause the ball is coming at a very steep angle
fadlsynd2tk_10-5-rgb_front so you see how gary has to be very patient cause it is very hard to hit a kill shot off this serve
fadlsynd2tk_2-5-rgb_front so it is much harder to hit a ball coming like that then it is one coming like that
fadlsynd2tk_3-5-rgb_front so watch what he does how he handles this ball
fadlsynd2tk_4-5-rgb_front it is going to take a lot more he is got to use his ears he is got to hear how solidly it is hitting the wall and he is also got to determine if it is going to come off the back wall cause if it is not going to come off the back wall you got to get it while it is in the air so let is see how he does
fadlsynd2tk_5-5-rgb_front ok he is taking my fine lob serve as if it is nothing
fadlsynd2tk_6-5-rgb_front that is pretty good
fadlsynd2tk_7-5-rgb_front but the beauty of a good lob serve for the server is i am going to have time to get over there to cover his shot
fadlsynd2tk_8-5-rgb_front that is pretty good
fadlsynd2tk_9-5-rgb_front good that is very good
fcagblf6__s_0-5-rgb_front alright now let is talk about eye contact
fcagblf6__s_1-5-rgb_front now when you have conversations with people most people make eye contact with the person that they are talking to
fcagblf6__s_2-5-rgb_front some people do not
fcagblf6__s_3-5-rgb_front it drives me crazy but some people do not
fcagblf6__s_4-5-rgb_front but in order to achieve a conversational style you need to make eye contact with your audience because that is how you build a relationship with your audience
fcagblf6__s_5-5-rgb_front but there are some things that are real important about eye contact
fcagblf6__s_6-5-rgb_front the thing of it is is that you have to do it but you have to do it to everyone
fcagblf6__s_7-5-rgb_front i have to look around at my entire audience
fcagblf6__s_8-5-rgb_front i cannot just focus on one particular section of my audience or one particular person maybe my mom is in the audience so i want to look at her or maybe one particular person is giving me really positive feedback so i want to talk to them
fcwlry8-xws_0-8-rgb_front okay so we are getting really close to changing the oil
fcwlry8-xws_1-8-rgb_front i just want to add one thing which is if your car is been sitting for a while your oil is more than likely the old oil
fcwlry8-xws_10-8-rgb_front so first step we are going to do towards changing the oil is we are going to remove the oil cap on top of the engine
fcwlry8-xws_11-8-rgb_front now these can be you know any place on the car
fcwlry8-xws_12-8-rgb_front not any place but more than likely closest to the engine
fcwlry8-xws_13-8-rgb_front but like i said before with the dipstick the engine oil for this car has a little graphic on it and also says engine oil which makes it a lot easier
fcwlry8-xws_14-8-rgb_front so make sure you get the right cap that you screw off
fcwlry8-xws_15-8-rgb_front but take this off and that is going to help your oil flow a little bit smoother as you are taking it out of your car as well
fcwlry8-xws_2-8-rgb_front that is more than likely kind of cold kind of depends on the weather
fcwlry8-xws_3-8-rgb_front but one thing you can do before you change the oil is you can go ahead and start your car up for a couple of minutes
fcwlry8-xws_4-8-rgb_front be careful with this though because if you start your car and leave it for too long your car gets too hot
fcwlry8-xws_5-8-rgb_front it is going to be really hot underneath when you are taking the oil out and when you are replacing the oil filter
fcwlry8-xws_6-8-rgb_front so you want to be really careful with that because you do not want to get burned on any of those hot parts underneath the car
fcwlry8-xws_7-8-rgb_front so just a tip
fcwlry8-xws_8-8-rgb_front you can go ahead and get that oil warmed up just a little bit
fcwlry8-xws_9-8-rgb_front and it is going to help your oil the old oil flow out of the car a lot smoother and get rid of more of the gunk and stuff that is in there
fc_c-h8ld3e_0-5-rgb_front this is the under side of the deck
fc_c-h8ld3e_1-5-rgb_front most decks are not coated underneath
fc_c-h8ld3e_10-5-rgb_front they were using the charcoal colored stain on the top and i believe it would cover these boards up in one coat really good
fc_c-h8ld3e_11-5-rgb_front so that leaves you something to think about if you want to coat the bottom of your deck or not
fc_c-h8ld3e_12-5-rgb_front also you do not think it is that much area maybe as much as the top of the deck but with all these joists so you almost have to double what you think you are going to need to paint the bottom of a deck
fc_c-h8ld3e_13-5-rgb_front it will go very very quickly
fc_c-h8ld3e_14-5-rgb_front now when i do the underside of a deck i use my air sprayer
fc_c-h8ld3e_15-5-rgb_front i have it turned up a little bit higher
fc_c-h8ld3e_16-5-rgb_front i shoot it and i leave it
fc_c-h8ld3e_17-5-rgb_front i do not try to get in there with a pad and pad it out and everything
fc_c-h8ld3e_18-5-rgb_front i just hit it as best i can with one good coat and make sure there are not any drips or runs in it and let it set and that should take care of it
fc_c-h8ld3e_2-5-rgb_front some people say that the wood should breathe
fc_c-h8ld3e_3-5-rgb_front others think it should be sealed tight
fc_c-h8ld3e_4-5-rgb_front i personally do not lean one way or the other
fc_c-h8ld3e_5-5-rgb_front if you have your deck over a patio or your driveway or carport you probably want to have it painted
fc_c-h8ld3e_6-5-rgb_front so this is raw wood
fc_c-h8ld3e_7-5-rgb_front it has been here years
fc_c-h8ld3e_8-5-rgb_front it has just grayed from the tannins in the redwood and everything
fc_c-h8ld3e_9-5-rgb_front where there are water marks on the deck if you paint this a light color you will have to coat it times to get rid of water marks because they just bleed through and bleed through
fe3fhjm12gc_0-5-rgb_front the first thing we want to do is get our drum ready for decorating and we are going to do that by applying a base paint over it so it covers up any markings and any decorations that are already on the can
fe3fhjm12gc_1-5-rgb_front now keep in mind that the base paint is only meant to cover up the colors and the writing that would show through if we were to put just a regular coat of paint directly onto the can
fe3fhjm12gc_2-5-rgb_front this basically makes it so that when we apply the colored paint we do not have any colors showing through
fe3fhjm12gc_3-5-rgb_front we apply this base paint over the entire image but just know that you will still see some of the colors but it will be less accentuated
fe5w2gfeiri_0-5-rgb_front so the next thing we are going to do after our skipping move it is kind of a rhythmic cut and we are going to drop down to the floor so like what we did in one of the earlier series we lifted our leg like this one of those little horse things and it is going to be kind of a shimmy and you want to fall to the floor so again like with those horse kicks that we did in badun bai our arms are going to be going in the opposite direction as our leg and then you want to drop to the floor
feixgq4f1xy_10-9-rgb_front sometimes it requires you to kick it with the heels of your boot or reach ahead of the snow hook bridle which is lying that is attached to the snow of your dog team and jerk it back a few times
feixgq4f1xy_11-9-rgb_front it will sort of free it from the hard packed snow
feixgq4f1xy_6-9-rgb_front just before you come to a stop you sink your snow hook in
feixgq4f1xy_7-9-rgb_front the tips are shaped with some down suction just like a plow share so that as you put the snow hook into the snow if it is shaped correctly the force of the sled or the pull going forward will actually drive that snow hook further into the snow and hopefully give you a good hold and keep your dogs stopped
feixgq4f1xy_8-9-rgb_front most of the time it will pull out without too much trouble but if you are in really good hard pack snow that has had a lot of traffic on it and its pretty packed almost ice
feixgq4f1xy_9-9-rgb_front you can have a hard time getting the snow hook out of it
fggpmfw4vvk_6-5-rgb_front it is a seven millimeter magnum it has a timed release bullet which i talked about before for depending on how much penetration you want before it mushrooms out
fggpmfw4vvk_7-5-rgb_front but having a high quality casing for whatever type of gun you are shooting is extremely important as casings that are overly can cause jams and it can also fail on you in the field
fgy0htudhsw_0-5-rgb_front next let is talk about socks
fgy0htudhsw_1-5-rgb_front socks for fencing are high
fgy0htudhsw_14-5-rgb_front but you are actually going to have a sock that comes up very high and protects this entire part of your leg so that where the shoe leaves off protecting you the sock picks up and then of course the pants pick up again after that
fgy0htudhsw_2-5-rgb_front they have to cover your entire shin
fgy0htudhsw_3-5-rgb_front they are for protection
fgy0htudhsw_8-5-rgb_front any sock is permissible
fgy0htudhsw_9-5-rgb_front and you want to select a sock that is thick enough to offer you a little bit of protection
fi7ewz_ncjw_0-5-rgb_front welcome back i am mike
fi7ewz_ncjw_1-5-rgb_front hopefully you have been following my first series of videos on how to get started to airbrush

fi7ewz_ncjw_3-5-rgb_front go to any of your local clothing store find a blank
fi7ewz_ncjw_4-5-rgb_front start off with a white or a light gray something like because when you get into the darker colors it makes it a little harder and there is a lot more advanced steps to go to to be able to airbrush on those colors
fi7ewz_ncjw_5-5-rgb_front with the you are going to need something to put the on
fi7ewz_ncjw_6-5-rgb_front you can not just hold it up here and try to paint it at the same time you need something that will hold your shirt for you

fi7ewz_ncjw_8-5-rgb_front if you go into the lingerie section or the underwear section you can get packages of two or three
fii1yomjewq_0-9-rgb_front i am going to tell you about bubble finesse
fii1yomjewq_1-9-rgb_front i think bubble finesse is a really cute word
fii1yomjewq_10-9-rgb_front and i call that straight streams bouncing behaving bubbles or bubbles at behave
fii1yomjewq_11-9-rgb_front also when you taste a glass of sparkling wine the bubbles should be so many and so small lets try it that they form like a creamy texture
fii1yomjewq_12-9-rgb_front in other words that even though this wine is very tart and very acidic and refreshing it should be smooth and soft because the bubbles kind of melt into one another and make like a cashmere blanket over your tongue
fii1yomjewq_13-9-rgb_front so the more bubbles the smaller the bubbles
fii1yomjewq_14-9-rgb_front bubbles that form trains
fii1yomjewq_15-9-rgb_front bubbles that behave
fii1yomjewq_16-9-rgb_front bubbles that start at the bottom come to the top and explode
fii1yomjewq_17-9-rgb_front bubbles that form a nice smooth cashmere kind of blanket over your tongue
fii1yomjewq_18-9-rgb_front these are all good things in sparkling wine and they are called bubble finesse
fii1yomjewq_2-9-rgb_front and it actually is a technical wine tasting term use for the quality of the bubble display and texture in a sparkling wine
fii1yomjewq_3-9-rgb_front if a sparkling wine has excellent bubble finesse it has lots and lots of bubbles
fii1yomjewq_4-9-rgb_front the more the better
fii1yomjewq_5-9-rgb_front it also has very small bubbles
fii1yomjewq_6-9-rgb_front the smaller the better
fii1yomjewq_7-9-rgb_front also the bubbles will form this beautiful straight little trains or streams
fii1yomjewq_8-9-rgb_front they will not bounce all over the place they just rise from bottom of the glass or wherever the bubble start and they go straight up to the top
fii1yomjewq_9-9-rgb_front this is actually called the point of bubble nucleation at the bottom of the glass
fkxtd89z44o_0-5-rgb_front hi i am casey i am with elements university
fkxtd89z44o_2-5-rgb_front in this segment i am going to show a tip on how to get your sideburns even
fkxtd89z44o_3-5-rgb_front so we all had people when they come into our salon that normally we would go ahead and judge the sideburns kind of on the same areas where we did on the ears
fkxtd89z44o_4-5-rgb_front for example if i had my client and i lined it up with the top of his ears i would go ahead and i would do the same on the other side
fkxtd89z44o_5-5-rgb_front in most cases the case our clients ears could be off things like that the best thing that i learned actually put your fingers where the sideburns are and that way you can actually tell where your off
fkxtd89z44o_6-5-rgb_front as you can tell on the right side i am definitely off as far as how even i am so all i am going to do is i am going to move my finger up in line with my other one
fkxtd89z44o_7-5-rgb_front come across remember we are making where the ear was and we are making that sideburns right off
fkxtd89z44o_8-5-rgb_front go ahead and put your fingers back and when they line up perfect then that is when you know they are even
fkxtd89z44o_9-5-rgb_front stay tune for our next segment which i am going to give you a tip on how to taper in the neck line
fl0hb3ckr6k_0-5-rgb_front so there is different types of coats on long coated breeds
fl0hb3ckr6k_1-5-rgb_front you can have a harsh course coat and you can also have a dog or a dog breed that has a finer softer silkier coat
fl0hb3ckr6k_10-5-rgb_front again with any breeds that are supposed to have one coat type you might have individuals or groups of individuals with another coat type
fl0hb3ckr6k_11-5-rgb_front it is much easier to maintain a harsh coated long haired dog than a finer coated dog and so if that is within your breed standard you want to make sure that that dog the dog that you get has that kind of harsh coat
fl0hb3ckr6k_12-5-rgb_front you can tell the individual hairs are thicker you can tell by rasping the hair between your fingers and you can tell just by touching the overall coat and looking at the adults and seeing how easy it is to brush through the adults
fl0hb3ckr6k_13-5-rgb_front the difference between a course harsh coat and a soft fine coat and for breeds with a soft finer coat is appropriate that is fine to get individuals of that coat type
fl0hb3ckr6k_14-5-rgb_front you just want to make sure that the grooming requirements are not going to be over what they would be for a normal dog within that breed standard
fl0hb3ckr6k_2-5-rgb_front the individual dogs are the breeds that have a finer softer long coat are going to require a lot more maintenance
fl0hb3ckr6k_3-5-rgb_front it is going to be more difficult to keep them brushed out because that fine coat is going to mat a little bit more
fl0hb3ckr6k_4-5-rgb_front an individual dog or a breed with a harsher courser coat is going to be a little bit easier to manage easier to keep brushed out
flxsdkwnhlm_10-8-rgb_front once you have done that go ahead and apply your lip liner making sure to apply it right underneath the lip line
flxsdkwnhlm_11-8-rgb_front this is going to help the feathering
flxsdkwnhlm_12-8-rgb_front it is going to help your liner to stay on longer and when you apply your lipstick it is going to also help your lipstick to stay on as well
flxsdkwnhlm_13-8-rgb_front you can color it in a little bit with your pencil and this just kind of creates a base for your lipstick
flxsdkwnhlm_14-8-rgb_front once you have done that you can go ahead and pick your lipstick color
flxsdkwnhlm_15-8-rgb_front once you pick your lipstick color make sure that you use a brush because it helps that you don t put on too much lipstick
flxsdkwnhlm_16-8-rgb_front when you put on too much lipstick it will run or bleed as your body temperature warms up
flxsdkwnhlm_17-8-rgb_front so once you have done this believe me you would not have anymore feathering or bleeding of your lipstick
flxsdkwnhlm_18-8-rgb_front go back one more time
flxsdkwnhlm_19-8-rgb_front dot the lip line and the lip area withe the same foundation that you used
flxsdkwnhlm_20-8-rgb_front go over it one more time with your brush and reapply your lipstick
flxsdkwnhlm_21-8-rgb_front if you do this carefully you will have a beautiful lip
flxsdkwnhlm_22-8-rgb_front my name is sylvia russell and this is how you can prevent your lipstick from bleeding
flxsdkwnhlm_3-8-rgb_front now if you are having this problem and you tried everything now is your opportunity to try this new trick
flxsdkwnhlm_4-8-rgb_front take your foundation like so
flxsdkwnhlm_5-8-rgb_front apply it directly to the top and bottom lip
flxsdkwnhlm_6-8-rgb_front make sure that the color is very natural and close to your skin tone because what we are doing we are creating a base to prevent the lip bleeding
flxsdkwnhlm_7-8-rgb_front once you do this you are well on your way to stop the bleeding
flxsdkwnhlm_8-8-rgb_front once you secure your foundation on top of the lip like so go ahead and take some translucent powder and apply it to the top of the powder of the foundation that you applied on your lip
flxsdkwnhlm_9-8-rgb_front this is going to set your foundation
fm3gufeh5lm_10-8-rgb_front that is the whirlpool

fm8dqo2a6py_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is lincoln ward
fm8dqo2a6py_1-5-rgb_front i am the director of the austin tennis center here in austin texas as well as a uspta certified teaching pro
fm8dqo2a6py_2-5-rgb_front today we are going to talk about how to your tennis racket
fm8dqo2a6py_3-5-rgb_front generally there are two different ways to your racket
fm8dqo2a6py_4-5-rgb_front you can replace the existing grip or you can add an over grip
fm8dqo2a6py_5-5-rgb_front the replacement grip is generally a little bit more expensive its the same as an over grip it just has an extra layer of cushion
fm8dqo2a6py_6-5-rgb_front if you are grip is if you are cushion is fine then i would recommend using an over grip and wrapping around the top of your original grip
fmlw7w6y35a_7-8-rgb_front i am sure they will be happy to appraise it for you and let you know what the wholesale value of that car is
fmlw7w6y35a_8-8-rgb_front that is a great way of making sure that you are getting the most car and not spending more money than you have to for it
fnlcl8tuvja_0-8-rgb_front andre boulay so next i want to show you how to actually throw an off string yoyo
fnlcl8tuvja_1-8-rgb_front the traditional throw is actually from a forward pass which we touched on in both the string trick and looping sections
fnlcl8tuvja_17-8-rgb_front i learned how to do it outside
fnlcl8tuvja_18-8-rgb_front i highly recommend doing that because it can definitely fly off
fnlcl8tuvja_19-8-rgb_front even you are good at it and every now and then you get a bad throw and it might shoot up into the air
fnlcl8tuvja_2-8-rgb_front so if you did not learn to forward pass yet go take a look at that section
fnlcl8tuvja_20-8-rgb_front so it is just like that
fnlcl8tuvja_21-8-rgb_front you throw release it lands onto the string
fnlcl8tuvja_22-8-rgb_front the second part is called the bind
fnlcl8tuvja_23-8-rgb_front if you have not learn how to bind i definitely recommend going to the single a section but basically what you are doing is you are taking the string up here in my hand pointer here
fnlcl8tuvja_24-8-rgb_front and i am taking it and point it down over the yoyo
fnlcl8tuvja_25-8-rgb_front it is actually going to grab the yoyo and return it back
fnlcl8tuvja_26-8-rgb_front let me just grab my yoyo here
fnlcl8tuvja_27-8-rgb_front i will show you really quick what that looks like
fnlcl8tuvja_28-8-rgb_front so if the yoyo was on the string spinning i would pull the string down over it almost as if you are actually going to wind it
fnlcl8tuvja_29-8-rgb_front and what happens is because it is spinning it is going to shoot that yoyo right back up to your hand
fnlcl8tuvja_3-8-rgb_front it is really important in order to do off string tricks
fnlcl8tuvja_30-8-rgb_front the reason i did not grab before was i did not pull quite fast enough cause i was trying to show you guys what it looks like
fnlcl8tuvja_4-8-rgb_front so you got your yoyo
fnlcl8tuvja_5-8-rgb_front i want you to wind it up and what you are going to do is you are going to hold it as if you are doing a forward pass
fobg3xio2r0_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to talk about an off side ferry an off side ferry is ferry to the side away from which i am paddling so if i am paddling to the right hand side of the boat an off side ferry would be a ferry to my left
fobg3xio2r0_1-8-rgb_front be coming from the other shore toward this eddy the basic principles of an off side ferry are the exactly the same as an on side ferry but there are some settle differences that can make all the difference in the success or failure on this move
fobg3xio2r0_7-8-rgb_front so for an off side ferry more conservative angle keep that angle a little more conservative all the way across until you get close to the eddy on the other side and then increase the angle and make a nice smooth exit from the current
foij4mtiw18_0-9-rgb_front my name is ryan parker with parker home renovations in new braunfels texas and i am going to teach you how to install or replace a door hinge
foij4mtiw18_1-9-rgb_front if you have a squeaky door hinge or one that is rusted shut and you simply need to replace it you can go down to the hardware store and find one that is the same type of hinge
foij4mtiw18_2-9-rgb_front they have different types the rounded edge hinge and they have the square hinge
foij4mtiw18_3-9-rgb_front make sure you look at the one that you had and try to get one that is comparable to that one
foij4mtiw18_4-9-rgb_front now as far as designs and colors you have many to choose from
foij4mtiw18_5-9-rgb_front you can go from anything from a white hinge to a black hinge to chrome whatever your preference is
foij4mtiw18_6-9-rgb_front after you pick out your hinges at your local hardware store bring them back home with you and then what you will have to do is you will have to open up your door try to get somebody to help you to hold up the outside of the door as it is open and then you can pop the screws off of the door frame side on all the hinges take the door completely off the door frame and then what you are going to want to do is where the hinge connects to the door do the same thing
foij4mtiw18_7-9-rgb_front take all the screws off the hinge on the door side and remove that hinge altogether
foij4mtiw18_8-9-rgb_front then you get your new hinge and you mount them back on the door the same way you took the other ones off set them in the mortise section screw the screws back into the holes and then you will have to hold your door back up and screw it back to the door frame and then you can shut the door and you have replaced your hinges
fp15jjgifka_0-5-rgb_front so now its important to choose the right record that will actually work together when you are trying to beat match
fp15jjgifka_1-5-rgb_front the first thing to rule out if you want to do any extensive beat matching is to pick records that stay the same speed throughout the entire record
fp15jjgifka_10-5-rgb_front its not really going to be possible because this is just so much slower than this
fp15jjgifka_11-5-rgb_front we have got this playing this speed this is a lot slower
fp15jjgifka_12-5-rgb_front you are never going to be able to get this record and this record to be the same speed because they are so far apart
fp15jjgifka_2-5-rgb_front a lot of older records a lot of rock records and especially a lot of pretty much records that came out before the eighties
fp15jjgifka_3-5-rgb_front a lot of them do not stay the same speed throughout the whole record and that will get you into horrible trouble because you match it and then it comes off
fp15jjgifka_4-5-rgb_front and its just going to be really difficult to match it
fp15jjgifka_5-5-rgb_front you are going to wonder what your problem
fp15jjgifka_6-5-rgb_front your problem is these records do not stay the same speed
fp15jjgifka_7-5-rgb_front also you need to pick records that are even close enough in speed that they can be matched
fp15jjgifka_8-5-rgb_front i was showing you with the pitch shifter that there is a finite range of how slow or how fast any particular record can get
fp15jjgifka_9-5-rgb_front if we wanted to match these two records i will show you real quick
fqtry8rja7e_0-3-rgb_front you know baroness is about making combinations of thirteen
fqtry8rja7e_1-3-rgb_front aces are worth one kings are worth thirteen and we are doing math with all the values in between
fqtry8rja7e_10-3-rgb_front this game can make very nice runs
fqtry8rja7e_11-3-rgb_front you can actually move six or seven cards off in one turn
fqtry8rja7e_2-3-rgb_front now for this board the only combination of thirteen that is available is this three plus one of the tens
fqtry8rja7e_3-3-rgb_front so i am going to take the three plus this ten that is thirteen
fqtry8rja7e_4-3-rgb_front and now i am looking for other combinations that add up to thirteen
fqtry8rja7e_5-3-rgb_front well a ten needs a three
fqtry8rja7e_6-3-rgb_front a two needs a jack because jacks are worth eleven
fqtry8rja7e_7-3-rgb_front an ace is worth one it needs a queen which is worth twelve
fqtry8rja7e_8-3-rgb_front so i have nothing that i can play
fqtry8rja7e_9-3-rgb_front but do not be disheartened
fr3a_kbbnoi_5-5-rgb_front so you want to immediately put them onto cooling racks some kind of cooling rack that will circulate the air underneath and above
fs7cjqyjfay_4-8-rgb_front research that car and get out there and enjoy everything that that car has to offer
fs7cjqyjfay_5-8-rgb_front forget to find out about the gas mileage any reviews that anyone has written about that car any other thing that will help you make an educated purchase on that vehicle
fuy84v7zanq_16-8-rgb_front get it at the smallest one you can
fuy84v7zanq_17-8-rgb_front there you go nice job nice clean job
fuy84v7zanq_18-8-rgb_front and you really really want to use wire strippers because it just gets a little too frustrating if you do not have this
fuy84v7zanq_19-8-rgb_front because it gets a little bit hard to strip the wire
fuy84v7zanq_20-8-rgb_front there you have it
fuy84v7zanq_21-8-rgb_front and all your wire is stripped
fuy84v7zanq_22-8-rgb_front just about an inch on each side because do not forget that the rubber that is around this wire insulates this
fuy84v7zanq_23-8-rgb_front so you have to have this open to charge and this is why you go ahead and strip the ends of it
fuy84v7zanq_24-8-rgb_front but you do not want to strip it here because you want to keep it insulated
fuy84v7zanq_25-8-rgb_front but you can still let the flow of electrons go through so you can make your telegraph
fw2dnp8_qo8_1-8-rgb_front today we are talking about how to put on a wig and what works and what does not
fw2dnp8_qo8_10-8-rgb_front once you do that you are going to do steps one that we have showed your previously before
fw2dnp8_qo8_2-8-rgb_front if you have really long hair down to here the best way to do that some people are afraid and they are like oh no i have way too much hair or my hair is way to long
fw2dnp8_qo8_3-8-rgb_front i can not possibly wear a wig
fw2dnp8_qo8_4-8-rgb_front but they are so much fun and you really should
fw2dnp8_qo8_5-8-rgb_front you can just braid your hair you know take a shower braid your hair all the way down then just flip it and put your cap on
fw2dnp8_qo8_6-8-rgb_front so you know once you have braided your hair completely just put your cap on on top of your braid and it would hold it down
fw2dnp8_qo8_7-8-rgb_front it does not matter how long or how thick your hair is
fw2dnp8_qo8_8-8-rgb_front i have seen women with their hair down to their knees and they have worn wigs we just condense it down
fw2dnp8_qo8_9-8-rgb_front braided it and just put it inside the cap and very neatly in here
fw5oybjjmsi_0-5-rgb_front now in this segment i am gonna tell you what kind of tools are needed
fw5oybjjmsi_1-5-rgb_front at least the kind that i use and i think most artists of mosaic use
fw5oybjjmsi_10-5-rgb_front i also use a marking pen to mark my glass how i and where i want to cut it
fw5oybjjmsi_11-5-rgb_front and this is the glue i use it is called lexall and it sticks to well it says it sticks to just about anything
fw5oybjjmsi_12-5-rgb_front and i find it nice cause it is clear and its easy to use
fw5oybjjmsi_13-5-rgb_front you need a glass grinder and that is what this is
fw5oybjjmsi_14-5-rgb_front and this you put water inside of here and then you can grind glass with it
fw5oybjjmsi_15-5-rgb_front and finally you are going to need some grout to put in it at the end
fw5oybjjmsi_16-5-rgb_front and also a sealer in a finish to put on the grout when you are all done with it after its dried up for a couple of days
fw5oybjjmsi_17-5-rgb_front it is very important to wear goggles in this kind or some kind when you are cutting glass because you do not want that stuff to kind of go up and land in you eye for sure
fw5oybjjmsi_18-5-rgb_front so always wear goggles when you are working with glass
fw5oybjjmsi_2-5-rgb_front you need a cutter a glass cutter
fw5oybjjmsi_3-5-rgb_front and one that you can put oil on the top is preferable because it slides easily along the glass and cuts it
fw5oybjjmsi_4-5-rgb_front i mean it is not something you can skimp on as far as i can see
fw5oybjjmsi_5-5-rgb_front you get the best you can and they are not terribly costly
fw5oybjjmsi_6-5-rgb_front then you need this is a cutting nipper
fw5oybjjmsi_7-5-rgb_front you cut into the glass and you squeeze this on to the line where you have made the cut and it breaks the glass
fw5oybjjmsi_8-5-rgb_front and then this is another pliers you can use to cut glass off of pieces
fw5oybjjmsi_9-5-rgb_front and these are a nipper if you want to get a lot of little pieces you use this nip along them
fwdg09u5wqq_0-1-rgb_front alright so let is talk about safety a little bit
fwdg09u5wqq_1-1-rgb_front first i want to talk about glass
fwdg09u5wqq_10-1-rgb_front i mean on a piece like this straight out of the store or from the glass factory these edges are not going to be tremendously sharp because they are kind of squared off
fwdg09u5wqq_11-1-rgb_front but you can still cut yourself on these edges so you want to be careful
fwdg09u5wqq_12-1-rgb_front but i guess the main thing is and i have already mentioned this but anytime you are cutting glass breaking glass or grinding glass you should probably be wearing your safety goggles because you can sometimes just have very very small pieces of glass fly up
fwdg09u5wqq_13-1-rgb_front and if they get in your eye they can cause a problem obviously
fwdg09u5wqq_14-1-rgb_front but just be kind of always aware where the edges are
fwdg09u5wqq_15-1-rgb_front if you are careful and do things in a controlled manner sometimes you will have glass breaking when you do not want it to but most of the time you will be able to control what it is doing
fwdg09u5wqq_16-1-rgb_front i guess what i am saying is you want to develop a certain confidence of working with glass so that you are comfortable cutting it and breaking it and you are not afraid all the time that you are going to cut yourself or end up in some disaster
fwdg09u5wqq_17-1-rgb_front because to a certain degree confidence is part of safety being confident in what you are doing
fwdg09u5wqq_18-1-rgb_front but at the same time you do not want to be so over confident that you forget where the sharp edges are or you forget to wear your safety glasses
fwdg09u5wqq_19-1-rgb_front so just kind of think about that when you are working with the glass
fwdg09u5wqq_2-1-rgb_front one of the things about glass is because it is glass is pretty strong but it is brittle okay
fwdg09u5wqq_3-1-rgb_front so what that means is you should not be afraid to work with glass
fwdg09u5wqq_4-1-rgb_front you should not be afraid that it is just going to be breaking all the time but you do have to be careful with it okay
fwdg09u5wqq_5-1-rgb_front so a lot of the techniques in stained glass require you to actively break a piece of glass with your hands or with the pliers and you should not be afraid of that because it is part of the technique
fwdg09u5wqq_6-1-rgb_front but because it is brittle a lot of times it can break when you do not want it to so we want to talk about that a little bit
fwdg09u5wqq_7-1-rgb_front but also obviously broken glass can be very sharp right
fwdg09u5wqq_8-1-rgb_front i do not like really working with gloves because i feel like when you are doing artistic things it is nice to have your tactile senses to their maximum so i personally would not work with gloves and i do not think many stained glass workers do
fwdg09u5wqq_9-1-rgb_front so you just kind of learn how to work with glass kind of knowing where the sharp edges are
fwzmvomhm8q_0-8-rgb_front the next step is the hair analysis to decide which technique for dreadlocks we are going to use on ashley
fwzmvomhm8q_1-8-rgb_front and ashley actually has very good hair and the reason i chose her is we can all of the techniques on ashley
fwzmvomhm8q_3-8-rgb_front most black hair is very curly
fwzmvomhm8q_4-8-rgb_front if you notice she has a relaxed on her end but if you look at the part that is not relaxed it is very curly very small little curls
_-adcxjm1r4_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to paint our board for our decoupage mirror
_-adcxjm1r4_1-8-rgb_front before you paint you want to make to rub off with a rag any of the dust from the sanding
_0-jkwz9o4q_10-5-rgb_front now you can get all three on your first roll
_0-jkwz9o4q_11-5-rgb_front but if your first roll does not include a six and a five than it will not matter if you got a four
_0-jkwz9o4q_12-5-rgb_front because you can not have crew unless there is a captain to hire them and you can not have a captain who does not have a ship
_0-jkwz9o4q_5-5-rgb_front ah this two and this one
_0-jkwz9o4q_6-5-rgb_front so it is ship captain crew cargo
_0-jkwz9o4q_7-5-rgb_front but i guess that would be too long a name for a game
_0-jkwz9o4q_8-5-rgb_front so it is just called ship captain and crew
_0-jkwz9o4q_9-5-rgb_front but remember that i cannot use a four until i first have a six and then a five and than a four
_0fo5etswyg_0-5-rgb_front you have used waterproof mascara now how do you remove it

_15cdiexndm_0-5-rgb_front hi
_15cdiexndm_10-5-rgb_front let it drip off a little bit put it on a cookie grate over a plate so that the chocolate drips on it
_15cdiexndm_2-5-rgb_front they are a great treat especially for kids but actually everybody likes it especially chocolate lovers
_15cdiexndm_3-5-rgb_front these are the chocolate chip cookies that i make that are in my book
_15cdiexndm_4-5-rgb_front it is a very simple recipe
_15cdiexndm_5-5-rgb_front chunk chocolate
_15cdiexndm_6-5-rgb_front but if you want to add more chocolate for your chocolate lovers the ganache comes in great for that
_15cdiexndm_7-5-rgb_front with the warm ganache what i am going to do is i am just going to take the cookies
_15cdiexndm_8-5-rgb_front now these are nice and firm because i had them in the refridgerator and i am going to dip them half way into the chocolate
_15cdiexndm_9-5-rgb_front okay
_20g7mg8k1u_0-8-rgb_front we want to talk to you a little bit about a inspection or a walk around we like to call it
_20g7mg8k1u_1-8-rgb_front it is very important any time you are going to use your tractor do not assume that it is in the same condition that you left it in
_20g7mg8k1u_10-8-rgb_front we are good it is full to the top
_20g7mg8k1u_11-8-rgb_front we want to get it back on there nice and snug
_20g7mg8k1u_12-8-rgb_front so we are good on radiator fluid checking your battery your leads are tight there and we will just continue walking around the tractor
_20g7mg8k1u_13-8-rgb_front check the same thing on this side
_20g7mg8k1u_14-8-rgb_front we would check the tire pressure again on both sides
_20g7mg8k1u_15-8-rgb_front again looking for any loose nuts and bolts these frame bolts can be important
_20g7mg8k1u_16-8-rgb_front tractors vibrate they tend to much more so than an automobile so these things can loosen up on you
_20g7mg8k1u_17-8-rgb_front we want to check our fluid level
_20g7mg8k1u_18-8-rgb_front you have got oil fill here it may be different on your tractor and for the interest of time we will keep moving but your oil fill
_20g7mg8k1u_19-8-rgb_front your fuel level we do not have much fuel here but that is enough for an hour or two of operation
_20g7mg8k1u_2-8-rgb_front things can vibrate loose tires can lose air pressure and all those can create potential safety problems
_20g7mg8k1u_20-8-rgb_front be aware of that because running out of fuel can be a pain
_20g7mg8k1u_21-8-rgb_front continuing on around the tractor we are checking for loose fittings loose nuts and bolts
_20g7mg8k1u_22-8-rgb_front coming back to the back with any implement that you have on the back of the tractor it is important to keep these stabilizer chains adjusted
_20g7mg8k1u_23-8-rgb_front you want these to be nice and snug that is what keeps the implement from swinging side to side and making contact with your tires which is a potential way to break things
_20g7mg8k1u_24-8-rgb_front we have completed our walk around we have done three hundred and sixty degrees we do not see any major problems we are ready to run it
_20g7mg8k1u_3-8-rgb_front we are going to talk around the tractor show you the things that you can do in just a couple of minutes to make sure you are going to have a safe experience every time you run your tractor
_20g7mg8k1u_4-8-rgb_front on our walk around as the name implies we want to walk around the tractor and look for anything that might create a potential safety problem
_20g7mg8k1u_5-8-rgb_front you are wheel lugs look good we do not see any leaks on the fuel line
_20g7mg8k1u_6-8-rgb_front we will go ahead and up the hood up on this one make sure your filter and everything is tight there
_20g7mg8k1u_7-8-rgb_front on your cooling system you have got an overflow bottle here with a full and a low mark but it is always a good idea when the tractor is cold of course which this one is to check in the radiator as well
_20g7mg8k1u_8-8-rgb_front i made a little bit of a mess there but that is not a big deal we can wipe that up
_20g7mg8k1u_9-8-rgb_front the reason is there is a hose here that allows this fluid to be drawn back into the radiator as the system cools down and if that hose becomes obstructed or comes loose inside of there this fluid will not return back to the radiator so you want to check that
_2u0mkrqpja_0-5-rgb_front now the first type of method of delivery is impromptu and impromptu is where you and the topic meet for the first time and you have zero preparation time to speak about the particular topic
_2u0mkrqpja_1-5-rgb_front now there are actually lots of ways that you speak impromptu already
_2u0mkrqpja_2-5-rgb_front sometimes maybe in class or at work or when you wherever it is that you go that you live that you exist in the world when you are asked questions and you have to answer them right on the spot
_2u0mkrqpja_3-5-rgb_front of course i thought about school immediately because let is say you have been given a chapter to read or a book to read and the teacher asks you a question about that chapter or book you are going to answer and that is impromptu
_2u0mkrqpja_4-5-rgb_front so it is also a speaking method but it is something that you actually do in real life
_2u0mkrqpja_5-5-rgb_front now in uil competitions there is sometimes impromptu speaking
_2u0mkrqpja_6-5-rgb_front sometimes in a business setting or a personal setting you might have to give an impromptu speech it is a birthday party and no one planned a speaker no one planned a special occasion speech so in that moment you are asked can you give a quick speech about jim
_2u0mkrqpja_7-5-rgb_front well you do not have time to prepare so you are going to give an impromptu speech
_45auond_so_0-5-rgb_front shanay norvell for bench dips you may want to use a bench press machine or a flat bench as long as you have plenty of room for your legs
_4pbd_wix_a_0-5-rgb_front a great variation of the hurricane is the hurricane out
_4pbd_wix_a_1-5-rgb_front basically it is the same trick that you get into only now once you are in the hurricane or feeble position you are going to keep traveling and come back down forward
_4pbd_wix_a_2-5-rgb_front the hurricane out is a very fun trick to do because you go all the way around get into the feeble grind or the hurricane and then you come back down forward
_4pbd_wix_a_3-5-rgb_front so in a way it is almost like a trick
_4pbd_wix_a_4-5-rgb_front so what you are going to want to do is set up in your feet a rolling fakie position going up the ramp backwards and just before you get to the top you generate enough momentum to turn all the way around and get into this feeble position
_5lwgjy_by8_0-5-rgb_front lust is a many splendored thing or is it
_5lwgjy_by8_1-5-rgb_front how to overcome lust
_5lwgjy_by8_10-5-rgb_front and i would say that if it begins to affect your life then you may want to put the controls on it and the way you control it is to satisfy the desire with someone who is meaningful
_5lwgjy_by8_2-5-rgb_front this is doctor paul author of boomer girls a boomer woman is guide to men and dating and host of ask doctor paul
_5lwgjy_by8_3-5-rgb_front lust by definition is connected with empty sex
_5lwgjy_by8_4-5-rgb_front if you choose to be a lustful person or whatever thing you lust for not necessarily sex but maybe it is for a hot car maybe it is for lusting for a career lusting for a clothing there are many ways of defining lust but let is look at this focus on lusting sexually
_5lwgjy_by8_5-5-rgb_front how to overcome lust
_5lwgjy_by8_6-5-rgb_front first you must define what you are term lust is
_5lwgjy_by8_7-5-rgb_front lust may be a very temporary thing
_5lwgjy_by8_8-5-rgb_front it may be a permanent thing but typically it is a temporary thing
_5lwgjy_by8_9-5-rgb_front it is not a longterm situation normally it is a short term satisfied item that really is not going to affect your life
_5kejzsmth0_0-5-rgb_front all right
_5kejzsmth0_1-5-rgb_front now that we have kind of felt out where things are going to go on the head we want to kind of get things in proportion
_5kejzsmth0_2-5-rgb_front so like i was saying in the last class the eyes are actually pretty low here so i want to bring the eyebrows down a little bit so the eyes are in proportion with the size of the head
_5kejzsmth0_3-5-rgb_front so i m just bringing these the bone of the skull down a little bit to where the eyes set more in proportion
_93xgbe3nga_1-5-rgb_front i have my white rice here i cooked from the night before
_93xgbe3nga_10-5-rgb_front if you do not want to eat the white rice because it is a little bit unhealthy for you you can do brown rice
_93xgbe3nga_11-5-rgb_front my mom in her old age is having this whole thing about no white rice
_93xgbe3nga_12-5-rgb_front she is very cuban and she makes a delicious brown rice and she goes ahead and puts the picadillo over it
_93xgbe3nga_2-5-rgb_front delicious fluffy white rice
_93xgbe3nga_3-5-rgb_front this is what we traditionally put our picadillo with
_93xgbe3nga_4-5-rgb_front the white rice and picadillo go hand in hand they go together
_93xgbe3nga_5-5-rgb_front you place it on the plate
_93xgbe3nga_6-5-rgb_front well actually you can also put on the side like in spanish restaurants
_93xgbe3nga_7-5-rgb_front they will put the rice in here and picadillo here
_93xgbe3nga_8-5-rgb_front i am going to do it this way
_93xgbe3nga_9-5-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and put the rice here
_boj9cypre4_12-8-rgb_front woman i already took it out of the ground
_boj9cypre4_13-8-rgb_front man ugh woman it is already man but no i will fix it
_boj9cypre4_14-8-rgb_front i can fix it
_boj9cypre4_15-8-rgb_front ok now over here we have the squash cantaloupes okay
_boj9cypre4_16-8-rgb_front this is a new thing
_boj9cypre4_17-8-rgb_front my cousin just made it
_boj9cypre4_18-8-rgb_front woman oh hi
_boj9cypre4_19-8-rgb_front look guys lets go play squash ball
_boj9cypre4_20-8-rgb_front woman yeah yeah ok alright right here
_boj9cypre4_21-8-rgb_front man yeah see
_boj9cypre4_22-8-rgb_front alright laughs
_clrzy5kkkk_10-5-rgb_front it is not the fur that people are allergic to but the proteins and they shed the same proteins that all cats have
_clrzy5kkkk_11-5-rgb_front that enzyme that people respond to as an allergen
_clrzy5kkkk_12-5-rgb_front so when your looking into whether or not you are allergic to this kind of cat you want to make sure to spend some time with him
_clrzy5kkkk_13-5-rgb_front the truth is all other cats shed
_clrzy5kkkk_14-5-rgb_front the shedding is a natural part of being a cat and in fact it is an important part of being a cat if our cat is not shedding that tells you that something is going on with your cat that is not right
_clrzy5kkkk_15-5-rgb_front they maybe ill and they may need some medical attention
_clrzy5kkkk_16-5-rgb_front for cats that do have fur there are lots of tools that can help you reduce the shedding
_clrzy5kkkk_17-5-rgb_front there are plenty of products like this that claim to help reduce shedding
_clrzy5kkkk_18-5-rgb_front usually it is a matter if they have a lot of vitamins and omega three fatty acids
_clrzy5kkkk_19-5-rgb_front basically they are supplements that help maintain a high quality of skin care for the cat which helps reduce the dander because the less dry skin which helps reduce shedding
_clrzy5kkkk_20-5-rgb_front the other thing that is really important for your cat especially if you have a medium to long haired cat is to groom the cat properly
_clrzy5kkkk_21-5-rgb_front this is a great tool
_clrzy5kkkk_22-5-rgb_front this is a rake you just rake it over the back of the cat is fur and you would be amazed how much fur you can pull out of the coat
_clrzy5kkkk_23-5-rgb_front i usually like to follow that up with this is a greyhound comb has the tines that are closer together then further apart so you can use the tines that are further apart across the coat first and then switch over to the tines that are closer together as you pull out more fur
_clrzy5kkkk_24-5-rgb_front if you end up with a mat this is a mat splitter that you can use to to gently lift the mat out
_clrzy5kkkk_25-5-rgb_front you just want to be careful not to hurt the cat
_clrzy5kkkk_26-5-rgb_front and then of course there is the ever important flea comb
_clrzy5kkkk_27-5-rgb_front there is other tools like there is all kinds of gloves like this that you can use to help just pull that fur out pull that fur out and just expose of it
_dlmidc-b8w_11-8-rgb_front you might be able for example to have fun backgrounds
_dlmidc-b8w_12-8-rgb_front you might be able to attach interesting surrounds to it
_dlmidc-b8w_13-8-rgb_front and of course you should always be able to upgrade the camera
_dlmidc-b8w_14-8-rgb_front so start with a cheap camera
_dlmidc-b8w_15-8-rgb_front and then you can always upgrade later
_dlmidc-b8w_16-8-rgb_front durability is also a big feature for kids
_dlmidc-b8w_17-8-rgb_front so go check reviews and choose a camera which is going to stand up to some hard use
_dlmidc-b8w_18-8-rgb_front at the beginning of course it is probably best to choose a very simple point and shoot camera
_dlmidc-b8w_19-8-rgb_front however later on you can always upgrade to a camera which has facilities such as an optical or digital zoom
_dlmidc-b8w_20-8-rgb_front which will have anti red eye facility
_dlmidc-b8w_21-8-rgb_front and perhaps is got a built in macro attachment on it
_dlmidc-b8w_22-8-rgb_front if you really have the money you might even be able to afford image stabilization
_dlmidc-b8w_23-8-rgb_front lastly do not worry too much about mega pixels
_dlmidc-b8w_24-8-rgb_front try to find a camera that is easier to use
_dlmidc-b8w_25-8-rgb_front the easier it is to use the better your child will like it
_dlmidc-b8w_26-8-rgb_front and remember lastly do not buy a camera that you like
_dlmidc-b8w_27-8-rgb_front because they will probably hate it
_dh512gx6d8_0-8-rgb_front before i apply the wax to the face i want to test the temperature of it
_dh512gx6d8_1-8-rgb_front if you burn the skin on the face if the wax is too hot it will burn and it will scab and it will take several days to heal and sometimes scar so you do not want to do that
_dh512gx6d8_10-8-rgb_front what you are actually looking for is the wax to be thick enough see to not drip off the stick
_dh512gx6d8_11-8-rgb_front that is the thickness that you are looking for
_dh512gx6d8_12-8-rgb_front if it runs off it is too hot sometimes the edges are a little thicker if it does not run off that is ready to go that wax is the right temperature to put on your face
_dh512gx6d8_13-8-rgb_front again if you are not sure test the wax on the inside of your wrist and i would recommend doing a test a heat test until you are familiar with what is not too hot
_dh512gx6d8_14-8-rgb_front you definitely do not want to burn yourself
_dh512gx6d8_15-8-rgb_front so test your temperature of your wax before you touch your face
_dh512gx6d8_2-8-rgb_front so take the time to test the temperature of the wax
_dh512gx6d8_3-8-rgb_front start by dipping your stick in and if the wax pours straight off i am going to do this a couple of times so you can see if the wax pours straight off that is way too hot to go on the face
_dh512gx6d8_4-8-rgb_front there is no wax staying on the stick so i can not use that wax
_dh512gx6d8_5-8-rgb_front another way to do that is remember how you used to test some people remember how you test a baby is bottle
_dh512gx6d8_6-8-rgb_front you touch it to the inside of your wrist
_dh512gx6d8_7-8-rgb_front that is too hot you do not put that on the face
_dh512gx6d8_8-8-rgb_front your face is more sensitive than any other area and the only other area that is even close to that is right here to the inside of your wrist
_dh512gx6d8_9-8-rgb_front so if that is too warm for there then it is definitely too warm for your face
_ewasdevpay_10-5-rgb_front and what we are going to do
_ewasdevpay_11-5-rgb_front we are going to squat down hold it and jump up
_ewasdevpay_13-5-rgb_front squat and jump
_ewasdevpay_14-5-rgb_front squat jump
_ewasdevpay_15-5-rgb_front be sure to breathe
_ewasdevpay_16-5-rgb_front you really get deep on that squat
_ewasdevpay_17-5-rgb_front feel it in the legs
_ewasdevpay_18-5-rgb_front keep your arms up
_ewasdevpay_19-5-rgb_front you keep your arms nice and out so they get strengthened this really gives you a cardiovascular exercise because of the jump
_ewasdevpay_20-5-rgb_front and it also strengthens the legs like crazy
_ewasdevpay_21-5-rgb_front also the arms are nice and strong and getting stronger from holding them out with resistance
_ewasdevpay_22-5-rgb_front so those are squat jumps
_ewasdevpay_3-5-rgb_front so we are going to do squat jumps next
_ewasdevpay_4-5-rgb_front and we are going to use our resistance bands to keep ourselves steady and balanced using each other
_ewasdevpay_5-5-rgb_front also strengthening the arms while doing it
_ewasdevpay_6-5-rgb_front so i am going to demonstrate
_ewasdevpay_7-5-rgb_front grace and i are going to demonstrate how to do squat jumps using your resistance bands
_ewasdevpay_8-5-rgb_front so our arms are nice and straight and out
_ewasdevpay_9-5-rgb_front our elbows are locked
_en4sumr1s8_7-8-rgb_front so you want to keep your speed up too
_en4sumr1s8_8-8-rgb_front so if you see a lot of deep powder and you need to ride through it or you want to go out riding in deep powder try to plan your track way ahead so that that way you can keep your speed up cause otherwise you could sink down and then you will be digging your sled out
_fs9zbji8qe_0-8-rgb_front hi
_fs9zbji8qe_10-8-rgb_front sometimes if you just apply lip liner you can just apply gloss throughout the day and it is going to keep that shape on the lips
_fs9zbji8qe_11-8-rgb_front for brides a lot of times i will actually use the lip liner as lip stick
_fs9zbji8qe_12-8-rgb_front because it is so long wearing or a little bit dryer on the lips it deposits that pigment very deep
_fs9zbji8qe_13-8-rgb_front our first step is to of course choose our pigment
_fs9zbji8qe_14-8-rgb_front because we went with a little bit more smokey eye we are going to go with a little bit subtle lip
_fs9zbji8qe_15-8-rgb_front i am actually going to start on the corner here and i am going to work my way up just sort of feathering in
_fs9zbji8qe_16-8-rgb_front now just doing a very dramatic line up again you are going to lose that intergrity of the lip and then follow that lower line just to create a little bit of definition
_fs9zbji8qe_17-8-rgb_front again if you were creating that long wearing effect at this point you could go ahead and apply all over the lip
_fs9zbji8qe_18-8-rgb_front watch our next segment on applying lip color
_fs9zbji8qe_2-8-rgb_front on our next segment i am going to be showing lip liner application
_fs9zbji8qe_3-8-rgb_front when applying lip liner our clients tend to make the same mistake
_fs9zbji8qe_4-8-rgb_front that mistake is to actually start our application from here and go down
_fs9zbji8qe_5-8-rgb_front what that is going to do is it is going to cut off the lips
_fs9zbji8qe_6-8-rgb_front if we were to start from the corner and go up we almost always never give up the integrity of the shape
_fs9zbji8qe_7-8-rgb_front that is the technique we are going to follow today
_fs9zbji8qe_8-8-rgb_front a lot of time lip liner gets left far behind but the amazing part about lip liner is that it is long wearing
_fs9zbji8qe_9-8-rgb_front it also creates a definition that is going to last all day
_fttczoobhg_0-8-rgb_front i will show you in this segment how to repair a torn painting
_fttczoobhg_1-8-rgb_front take a look at this beautiful painting this beautiful work of art is from the nineteen twenties
_fttczoobhg_10-8-rgb_front obviously if from the front you have got no damage you have no visible damage the repair has been adequately
_fttczoobhg_11-8-rgb_front let me give you an example
_fttczoobhg_2-8-rgb_front from first glance as a connoisseur of art and as a person who loves art you really can not tell there is anything wrong with it
_fttczoobhg_3-8-rgb_front the only way to be in a museum and know if a painting has had any damage is not to look at it from the front because sometimes the front has been repaired so well that you can not tell
_fttczoobhg_4-8-rgb_front there are two ways to do it
_fttczoobhg_5-8-rgb_front number one you use a light a blue light and black light the painting and then what happens is you can tell if there is been any in painting done in the painting
_fttczoobhg_6-8-rgb_front if there is in painting that will show up
_fttczoobhg_7-8-rgb_front almost like something fluorescent
_fttczoobhg_8-8-rgb_front the other which is what they do not want you to see for the most part is the back of a painting
_fttczoobhg_9-8-rgb_front because from the back of the painting you know if there is been any repairs and if the repairs have been done well
_ci1iebsgvw_0-8-rgb_front in this clip i want to talk to you about when to scrub your skin
_ci1iebsgvw_1-8-rgb_front people often ask me do i scrub my skin in the morning
_ci1iebsgvw_10-8-rgb_front again for oily skin you can go four to seven times a week
_ci1iebsgvw_11-8-rgb_front for mature skin every day with a gentle scrub
_ci1iebsgvw_12-8-rgb_front for sensitive skin you want to do it like once two times a week
_ci1iebsgvw_2-8-rgb_front do i scrub my skin at night
_ci1iebsgvw_3-8-rgb_front i like to do it at night because you really have the time to dedicate to your skin
_ci1iebsgvw_4-8-rgb_front in the morning everyone s getting ready for work
_ci1iebsgvw_5-8-rgb_front they do not have time
_ci1iebsgvw_6-8-rgb_front they are rushing
_ci1iebsgvw_7-8-rgb_front in the night time you really have time to focus and give yourself a thorough massage and really get those dead skin cells off
_ci1iebsgvw_8-8-rgb_front also throughout the day especially living in a city you have an accumulation of dead skin cells and dirt on your skin so we want to make sure that you remove that in the evening before you go to bed and scrubbing is really a great way to do so as opposed to just using a cleanser
_ci1iebsgvw_9-8-rgb_front so definitely i want to reiterate nighttime and you are going to want to scrub depending on your skin type one to seven times a week
_dezy_nbd4g_0-8-rgb_front this is richard goms we are here in murray utah and we are talking about basic car care
_dezy_nbd4g_1-8-rgb_front i would like to show you or discuss the difference between synthetic oil and regular oil
_dezy_nbd4g_2-8-rgb_front now we have a bottle of regular oil here and we have a bottle of synthetic oil internally they look the same but as far as how they work they work differently
_dwcuskvdiu_10-8-rgb_front if you were at a restaurant for example
_dwcuskvdiu_11-8-rgb_front the hearing aid will pick up sounds in front of the listener better than what is going on behind or beside the listener
_dwcuskvdiu_12-8-rgb_front if you are sitting across the table from someone in a restaurant you are going to hear the voice of the person you are talking to loudest then the noise that is happening beside or behind you
_dwcuskvdiu_5-8-rgb_front one of the biggest challenges that people wear hearing aids have is hearing in noise
_dwcuskvdiu_6-8-rgb_front up until you know the last decade there were not a lot of very good solutions for dealing with the issue of hearing in noise with a hearing aid
_dwcuskvdiu_7-8-rgb_front over the last few years there have been a couple of developments that have really improved that situation
_dwcuskvdiu_8-8-rgb_front perhaps the most significant development is the directional microphone
_dwcuskvdiu_9-8-rgb_front the directional microphone allows the hearing aid wearer to pick up sounds in one direction more than in any other direction
a-wmwisi12s_0-2-rgb_front hi
a-wmwisi12s_10-2-rgb_front that is always moistened over here even on hot dried summer days
a-wmwisi12s_11-2-rgb_front now the other things that i need to consider is where does the sun rise where does the sunset how does the sun move through my garden through the day
a-wmwisi12s_12-2-rgb_front because of that in my garden i started with lower plants over to one side and i work over the higher plants on the other side and that allows the plants to get light continually throughout the day without shading one another out
a-wmwisi12s_13-2-rgb_front another consideration for me cause i have such a small garden was other garden surfaces that i can use and you could see back behind here i have gone vertical in my garden and i grow my beans up that to maximize the little garden space that i do have
a-wmwisi12s_14-2-rgb_front with just a little for thought and with just a little bit of concentration you can look and find the right place in your yard for your garden and figure out the plants that you want to grow
a-wmwisi12s_15-2-rgb_front sure i wanted to add tomatoes but looking over my garden i had room for
a-wmwisi12s_16-2-rgb_front be realistic when your obsessive your garden and the space that you have in it play it accordingly and your garden would reward you with great vegetables all summer long
a-wmwisi12s_2-2-rgb_front hi
a-wmwisi12s_3-2-rgb_front lets talk for a couple of minutes about designing your garden
a-wmwisi12s_4-2-rgb_front i think it is one of the things that people over look when they are building there vegetable gardens but it is one of those things that are going to lead to a long term success or a failure if you do not get it right
a-wmwisi12s_5-2-rgb_front so what are the things that plants really needs
a-wmwisi12s_6-2-rgb_front well one of the things that they need is light and water
a-wmwisi12s_7-2-rgb_front when i laid out my vegetable garden i found the sun is placed in my yard and that is where my vegetable garden went
a-wmwisi12s_8-2-rgb_front now i did it here for a couple of other reasons to we have talked about water this is one of the places in my yard where the surface water tends to feed off
a-wmwisi12s_9-2-rgb_front i have even directed some of the down spout from my house to this area because i have a raised bed garden that was a consideration of my design i can take the water move it right in this garden area and it helps keep the garden deep watered
a0lzw6lo7jw_1-8-rgb_front now we are going to sew our bear body together
a0lzw6lo7jw_10-8-rgb_front with the outside facing each other so i have the inside of the bear facing on the outside
a0lzw6lo7jw_11-8-rgb_front they call this right side together
a0lzw6lo7jw_2-8-rgb_front first i want to slice a hole in the back that we are going to use for the stuffing
a0lzw6lo7jw_3-8-rgb_front so take the back bear section this is the front bear section is the one that we embroider on
a0lzw6lo7jw_4-8-rgb_front the back bear section is plain and just fold it in half
a0lzw6lo7jw_5-8-rgb_front slice about a inch into there
a0lzw6lo7jw_6-8-rgb_front so you have a two inch slice on the back and that is what we would use that hole for when we want to stuff the bear
a0lzw6lo7jw_7-8-rgb_front now look for the outside of the fabric
a0lzw6lo7jw_8-8-rgb_front this fabric does have that inside and outside
a0lzw6lo7jw_9-8-rgb_front you want to put the bears together the bear sections together
a0te0h5ms1y_1-9-rgb_front are you not a lines guy or gal
a0te0h5ms1y_2-9-rgb_front are straight edges and getting that really nice straight line just difficult for you to get
a0te0h5ms1y_22-9-rgb_front you want to make sure that there are not little white barriers kind of sneaking around here and escaping your painting brush
a0te0h5ms1y_23-9-rgb_front now after we have done this and we are satisfied and we are really happy with the painting layer we have on here the tape is surrounded so we do not have to worry about if there is any edges we want to get on later on
a0te0h5ms1y_24-9-rgb_front now we are going to take the tape off
a0te0h5ms1y_25-9-rgb_front some people wait for the tape to dry
a0te0h5ms1y_26-9-rgb_front it depends kind of on what you are doing
a0te0h5ms1y_27-9-rgb_front be very gentle and pull away the first strip
a0te0h5ms1y_28-9-rgb_front now let is pull away the second strip
a0te0h5ms1y_29-9-rgb_front and you can see voila those wonderful straight lines you have always wanted
a0te0h5ms1y_3-9-rgb_front well there is a nice technique you can use which is called masking
a0te0h5ms1y_30-9-rgb_front here you go
a0te0h5ms1y_31-9-rgb_front you can do this when you can combine different layers of paint or maybe you are just going to use this as a guideline
a0te0h5ms1y_32-9-rgb_front now you can fill this in yourself
a0te0h5ms1y_33-9-rgb_front you can do multiple layers of this getting really cool cascading very nice straight lined effects for you paintings
a0te0h5ms1y_4-9-rgb_front it basically involves obviously some painting but also some tape applied to your canvas
a0te0h5ms1y_5-9-rgb_front first take off a couple strips of masking tape
a0te0h5ms1y_6-9-rgb_front now make sure that the tape you use is either artist tape or is like a type of most masking tapes should be fine but you do not want duct tape because you could actually rip the surface of your canvas or actually just your entire canvas in two because that stuff is industrial strength stick
a0te0h5ms1y_7-9-rgb_front you put your masking tape on here
a0te0h5ms1y_8-9-rgb_front now we are going to fill around here with paint
a0te0h5ms1y_9-9-rgb_front and just go nuts on this you know
a3kzdriq20o_0-8-rgb_front hi
a3kzdriq20o_2-8-rgb_front in this video clip i will be showing you step for installing a smoke detector
a3kzdriq20o_3-8-rgb_front now there should be a smoke detector installed in every room of your house including every hallway
a3kzdriq20o_4-8-rgb_front this room does not have a smoke detector in it so we need to find a good location for it
a3kzdriq20o_5-8-rgb_front the smoke detector that i have chosen happens to detect smoke and carbon monoxide
a3kzdriq20o_6-8-rgb_front if you take a look at the packing you will notice that this is designed for bedrooms
a3kzdriq20o_7-8-rgb_front they do have other smoke detectors that are designed for kitchens hallways or other rooms of the house
a3kzdriq20o_8-8-rgb_front i am going to be installing the smoke detector towards the door of this room in the event that there was a fire outside of this room the smoke would come down the hallway and come in raised to the ceiling right in front of that door and set that smoke detector off first
a4mss36gmre_0-3-rgb_front okay so from here what we are going to do is sew this closed and you know as you can see the green is on the inside the black is on the outside
a4mss36gmre_1-3-rgb_front i do not want black thread showing on my green fabric because it is really pretty and i just want something that matches like this thread that i chose
a4mss36gmre_10-3-rgb_front i like to back stitch on these straps also
a4mss36gmre_11-3-rgb_front you can not never sew the straps too many times
a4mss36gmre_13-3-rgb_front we are almost done here
a4mss36gmre_14-3-rgb_front okay all we have left to do now is to sew two buttons on one on the inside and one on the outside
a4mss36gmre_2-3-rgb_front if you notice it is a really good color for that
a4mss36gmre_3-3-rgb_front and the outside of course is going to be black
a4mss36gmre_4-3-rgb_front so i have you know this funky little color for the green on top the black is on bottom
a4mss36gmre_5-3-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and sew this closed
a4mss36gmre_6-3-rgb_front you just line these up together
a4mss36gmre_7-3-rgb_front i like to start right here on the button catch
a4mss36gmre_8-3-rgb_front sew that
a4mss36gmre_9-3-rgb_front and we are just going to go right around the lip
a5bjcnxaxwu_0-8-rgb_front okay so as you can see we have our plant pot here it is been drying on our racks for a little while
a5bjcnxaxwu_1-8-rgb_front and we will see if it is there we go yes it is popped right off of there
a5bjcnxaxwu_10-8-rgb_front and to make my life easier what i like to do is take a pencil and simply draw some concentric lines on the bat
a5bjcnxaxwu_11-8-rgb_front you can do this with water or different kinds
a5bjcnxaxwu_12-8-rgb_front some bats come with rings already on them to help with this
a5bjcnxaxwu_13-8-rgb_front but as you can see i am simply giving myself some concentric circles
a5bjcnxaxwu_14-8-rgb_front now i am going to take my plant pot and turn it upside down like this and then take it down on to the bat and line it up with one of those circles
a5bjcnxaxwu_15-8-rgb_front this really does make life so much easier in the long run
a5bjcnxaxwu_16-8-rgb_front because now we already have the pot basically centered on the wheel
a5bjcnxaxwu_17-8-rgb_front okay so we have our pot on the wheel turned upside down
a5bjcnxaxwu_18-8-rgb_front and we are ready to center this pot onto the wheel
a5bjcnxaxwu_19-8-rgb_front and i will be showing you how to do that next
a5bjcnxaxwu_2-8-rgb_front so now we can see what we have is a pot that is ready to be trimmed
a5bjcnxaxwu_3-8-rgb_front and to trim this pot i would like to quickly give some tips on how to make this a quick and easy process
a5bjcnxaxwu_4-8-rgb_front what i have here is just a regular bat on the wheel
a5bjcnxaxwu_5-8-rgb_front we can get different kinds of bats for trimming some come with a piece of carpet or felt on top
a5bjcnxaxwu_6-8-rgb_front so that we can place a pot on and it will not slip around
a5bjcnxaxwu_7-8-rgb_front they also make what is called a giffen grip which has a gear inside it
a5bjcnxaxwu_8-8-rgb_front which will center the pot for you as you turn the wheel
a5bjcnxaxwu_9-8-rgb_front however i just have a regular bat here that you will find in any ceramic studio

a6xkfgehx4a_1-5-rgb_front today i would like to talk to you about traveling with your pet rat
a6xkfgehx4a_10-5-rgb_front you can put it on your back or your front as you carry your rat with you and you can put multiple rats in here unless he decides to chew out
a6xkfgehx4a_11-5-rgb_front this is a wonderful carrier
a6xkfgehx4a_12-5-rgb_front these carriers should not be left with your rat alone anywhere because they can chew the cloth and get out of the rat carrier and then he would be gone
a6xkfgehx4a_13-5-rgb_front you should not leave your rat unattended in a car or anywhere
a6xkfgehx4a_14-5-rgb_front the second one i am going to show you is this carrier this is my favorite one
a6xkfgehx4a_15-5-rgb_front this has a little door so put your rat in the little door and zip it up
a6xkfgehx4a_16-5-rgb_front and it has lots of different windows it has plastic windows and doors that also opens this way
a6xkfgehx4a_17-5-rgb_front it has two handles this is like the gucci bag to rat carriers
a6xkfgehx4a_18-5-rgb_front you can also carry multiple rats in this carrier
a6xkfgehx4a_19-5-rgb_front the third one i am going to show you is a cat carrier you can buy this to put your cat or chihuahua dog in
a6xkfgehx4a_2-5-rgb_front pet rats love to go places with you they are very intelligent and they love to travel and they love to be with their friends
a6xkfgehx4a_20-5-rgb_front this one is a little fancier and it is not as secure as the other carriers are since the rat can get out of this one but it is awfully pretty
a6xkfgehx4a_21-5-rgb_front you put your rat inside and zip it up
a6xkfgehx4a_22-5-rgb_front but as you can see you rat can sneak out in the front
a6xkfgehx4a_23-5-rgb_front it is not as secure as the other carriers but as long as you are not leaving your rat unattended they cannot get out and disappear on you
a6xkfgehx4a_3-5-rgb_front it is fun to take your pet rat to your friend is house or maybe you may be going to the veterinarian or maybe you may be going to a rat show
a6xkfgehx4a_4-5-rgb_front i have here four different travel cases for your rat

a6xkfgehx4a_6-5-rgb_front it has a little window in it so your rat can get air
a6xkfgehx4a_7-5-rgb_front so you put your rat in the travel carrier and you can zip it up
a6xkfgehx4a_8-5-rgb_front and there is no way for your rat to get out unless he chews his way out
a6xkfgehx4a_9-5-rgb_front the great thing about this one is that it is a back pack
a7bqylntfqo_0-5-rgb_front hi this is brenda and today we are working on our cards
a7bqylntfqo_1-5-rgb_front project today will be a snowman
a7bqylntfqo_10-5-rgb_front the secret to this project is when you are drawing on the snowman you need to make some little tabs on his arms like this and those little tabs are what you are going to glue to the card stock and that is going to be holding him down to the card stock
a7bqylntfqo_11-5-rgb_front you will notice that got a fold also up this half like this so that when you fold it over he will pop out at you
a7bqylntfqo_12-5-rgb_front this is what it looks like from the side angle
a7bqylntfqo_13-5-rgb_front so those little tabs if you can see underneath are just glued to the index card like this and folded in so that you really see them but they hold him into the card
a7bqylntfqo_14-5-rgb_front added some glitter to look like snow
a7bqylntfqo_15-5-rgb_front embellished it with a few little snowflakes
a7bqylntfqo_16-5-rgb_front you can use different colors if you like
a7bqylntfqo_17-5-rgb_front we use our under liner like this to cover up any cuttings so that you see where you cut into the snowman so that when our recipient opens the card like this the snowman will pop out at him like this
a7bqylntfqo_2-5-rgb_front we will need our x index cards some glitter glue markers scissors and we are ready to begin
a7bqylntfqo_3-5-rgb_front we need to fold our x index card in half like this and we will also have a under liner
a7bqylntfqo_4-5-rgb_front it is also a x
a7bqylntfqo_5-5-rgb_front it can be any color that you like and it will be covering up our cuttings that we are going to be making on our index cards
a7bqylntfqo_6-5-rgb_front first we will take our marker any color that you like
a7bqylntfqo_7-5-rgb_front just going to draw a simple little snowman two little circles a little hat like this some eyes a little nose and we will be cutting him out
a7bqylntfqo_8-5-rgb_front for times sake i am going to show you the finished product like this
a7bqylntfqo_9-5-rgb_front our little snowman
a8qr93mufq0_0-8-rgb_front hi i am amelia and i am going to discuss how to straighten curly hair
a8qr93mufq0_1-8-rgb_front there are several ways to do it
a8qr93mufq0_10-8-rgb_front in other words a straightening shampoo and a straightening balm
a8qr93mufq0_11-8-rgb_front what a straightening balm is going to do is it is actually going to coat the hair
a8qr93mufq0_12-8-rgb_front they usually have silicones in them and that actually coats the hair shafts fills up the holes if you will to prevent frizz and keep the humidity out
a8qr93mufq0_13-8-rgb_front what a flat iron is going to do is it is actually going to go in and squish if you will really flatten out these cuticle layers so that way it gets that hair extremely straight and it will stay straight
a8qr93mufq0_14-8-rgb_front the only problem with flat irons is a lot of times they are overused so when using a flat iron always make sure that you use some sort of heat protection
a8qr93mufq0_15-8-rgb_front either something you apply wet or dry prior to flat ironing in order to really protect that hair from that heat because that heat just directly on the hair shaft and it is basically like baking the hair so you just want to make sure that whichever one you choose you always use some sort of protection on your hair
a8qr93mufq0_2-8-rgb_front first there are chemicals
a8qr93mufq0_3-8-rgb_front you can use a relaxer and apply it to the hair and it will chemically break down the bonds and straighten the curly hair
a8qr93mufq0_4-8-rgb_front the other way is with a straightening balm and heat
a8qr93mufq0_5-8-rgb_front any type of heat and tension on the curly hair will actually pull it straight and another way a third way is to use the flat iron
a8qr93mufq0_6-8-rgb_front with the relaxer you just want to be sure that you do not double up on chemical services
a8qr93mufq0_7-8-rgb_front you do not want to have already bleached or colored your hair in order to get the best results
a8qr93mufq0_8-8-rgb_front you always want to make sure that that hair has not been touched by any other chemical service because that way it will stay the longest and also your hair will not have any breakage
a8qr93mufq0_9-8-rgb_front with the blow dryer you always want to make sure that you are using straightening products
a8phf6lz3pm_1-5-rgb_front i am going to go over with you some of the elements and principles of design
a8phf6lz3pm_2-5-rgb_front having taught art for twenty some odd years there are certain basic things that every person interested in learning to paint or to draw needs to know
a8phf6lz3pm_3-5-rgb_front i tell my students constantly that you can get a photographic likeness but f you do not have a good composition is not a good painting
a8phf6lz3pm_4-5-rgb_front so remember the composition actually there are two things composition color are the keys to painting
a8phf6lz3pm_5-5-rgb_front so today we are going to start talking about composition which is basic and is used for every medium in both painting and drawing and every type of medium used water color gash acrylic etc
a8phf6lz3pm_6-5-rgb_front stay tuned for the next segment where i will begin to explain the elements of design
a8zonzpmxik_0-8-rgb_front in this next segment i want to talk to you about the trailer hitch lighting
a8zonzpmxik_1-8-rgb_front the trailer has lights so you have got to be able to plug it in to your vehicle lights
a8zonzpmxik_10-8-rgb_front when we are talking about trailer lights i have already shown you one type of trailer light where it plugs in and it is integrated in with the braking system of the trailer but if you do not have a vehicle with trailer brakes or a trailer with trailer brakes this is probably the plug that you are going to be seeing
a8zonzpmxik_11-8-rgb_front it is a little four flat four pin plug
a8zonzpmxik_12-8-rgb_front it is pretty common most vehicles have them
a8zonzpmxik_13-8-rgb_front this is what is going to be on your vehicle and it is very simple to use
a8zonzpmxik_14-8-rgb_front you can not go wrong there is one pin that is different than the rest and you will just simply plug it in to your trailer like so when you are ready to go
a8zonzpmxik_15-8-rgb_front so when you hook it up make sure you plug your lights in so the people behind you can see what you are doing
a8zonzpmxik_2-8-rgb_front you have brake lights turn signals so you can warn the people behind you when you are stopping
a8zonzpmxik_3-8-rgb_front this vehicle came with a towing package installed on it so because it came with a towing package it also has trailer brakes
a8zonzpmxik_4-8-rgb_front this is the kind of plug in that you are going to have for trailer brakes
a8zonzpmxik_5-8-rgb_front it is larger and more round and it is got like a pin plug in pin plug in inside
a8zonzpmxik_6-8-rgb_front so when you plug it in you are trailer brakes will actually operate off of the vehicle itself
a8zonzpmxik_7-8-rgb_front some vehicles you are going to have to wire the brakes yourself
a8zonzpmxik_8-8-rgb_front you are going to have to wire the lights yourself
a8zonzpmxik_9-8-rgb_front the like possibly on a ford ranger you can buy a plug and it plugs into your wiring harness so you do not have to splice any wires but some vehicles do not come with that capability so what you are going to have to do is you are going to have to actually splice into the brake lamp wiring inside of the trunk of the vehicle
a9cgiaol6wq_1-5-rgb_front we are gonna roll this beautiful hair today
a9cgiaol6wq_10-5-rgb_front or maybe the customer wants a more tighter curl
a9cgiaol6wq_11-5-rgb_front wavy like hollywood now in days and she might want something like this or this
a9cgiaol6wq_12-5-rgb_front there is many different types of rollers you know
a9cgiaol6wq_13-5-rgb_front i use the smooth type so it does not tangle in the hair and it does not cause any damage okay
a9cgiaol6wq_14-5-rgb_front because if it tangles in it you can not get a smooth look
a9cgiaol6wq_2-5-rgb_front she has curly hair but it tense to frizz a lot
a9cgiaol6wq_3-5-rgb_front so a great way to control frizz is to do a great roller set a good roller set
a9cgiaol6wq_4-5-rgb_front but it really is essential to learn to roll a set properly when you are dealing with curly hair wavy hair or frizzy hair
a9cgiaol6wq_5-5-rgb_front so we are going to go ahead and look at the hair and see which kind of rollers we want to use
a9cgiaol6wq_6-5-rgb_front also ask the customer what kind of wave she wants her hair to flow
a9cgiaol6wq_7-5-rgb_front maybe she wants a straighter look
a9cgiaol6wq_8-5-rgb_front when i roll it so i will use big rollers
a9cgiaol6wq_9-5-rgb_front somewhat like this
a9abaefmeqq_1-5-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and have a little bit of this now
a9abaefmeqq_2-5-rgb_front i have not had my salmon yet but i can tell that little bit of cheese that hit the salad is delicious

a9abaefmeqq_5-5-rgb_front i cook it thorough some people like it more pink
a9abaefmeqq_6-5-rgb_front i would be more of a deeper pink
a9abaefmeqq_7-5-rgb_front i like it cooked like this cause i like the little toasty to the salmon
a9abaefmeqq_8-5-rgb_front this is the way to eat this just go ahead and dig in
aajxgyieehu_0-5-rgb_front if you have ever seen somebody cart wheeling effortlessly in a hole it is because they have dialed in their boat control and their body movements
aajxgyieehu_1-5-rgb_front there is main body movements we can do in our kayaks without using our kayak paddle
aajxgyieehu_2-5-rgb_front one is forward and back motion
aajxgyieehu_3-5-rgb_front one is motion or edges and the third is our torso rotation moving side to side
aajxgyieehu_4-5-rgb_front if somebody is cart wheeling cleanly the timing of these allow them to keep pulling their boat around in circles
aajxgyieehu_5-5-rgb_front to demonstrate this i will move my boat without even taking a stroke
aajxgyieehu_6-5-rgb_front this is the ultra clean drill and what we are doing is making small scooping motions with our boat by using our boat edges
aajxgyieehu_7-5-rgb_front forward and back leans to help encourage our ends underneath the water and torso rotation to pull our boat into each turn
aajxgyieehu_8-5-rgb_front the more aggressive you get with it the more vertical you can become
aabdm-mtisw_0-3-rgb_front here we have a really fun style of skirt
aabdm-mtisw_1-3-rgb_front sometimes it boarders on trendy sometimes it does not it just depends
aabdm-mtisw_2-3-rgb_front it is all how you reference it and how you design around it
aabdm-mtisw_3-3-rgb_front we have an asymmetric skirt asymmetric meaning it is not the same length all around
aabdm-mtisw_4-3-rgb_front this one i have chosen to depict one that is short in the front than it is in the back
aabdm-mtisw_5-3-rgb_front a easy way to render this when you are drawing it decide of course where you want your waistline then decide how short or how long you want the front part of your skirt to be
aabdm-mtisw_6-3-rgb_front i want my front part of my skirt to be right there well that is a little short
aabdm-mtisw_7-3-rgb_front i want the front part of my skirt to be right there and i want the back part as i said earlier to be longer
aabdm-mtisw_8-3-rgb_front the easiest way to do that and have it look three dimensional is to dip it down behind the legs from the corners
aabdm-mtisw_9-3-rgb_front that way if you are looking at something straight on you can see that it is longer in the back
aaxwzvogyxs_0-5-rgb_front this is what is known as a fort
aaxwzvogyxs_1-5-rgb_front a lot of times it is just simply an enclosure made with found and scavenged materials
aaxwzvogyxs_2-5-rgb_front the key here is that you have a little bit of additional cover from just about every direction and you can see in just about every direction
aaxwzvogyxs_3-5-rgb_front a lot of times the strength in a position like this for a game like protect the vip it is pretty essential that you have more than one person because you can be flanked from any direction that you can not see
aaxwzvogyxs_4-5-rgb_front so in a case like vip you would be trying to get your vip into this location and then hold this location for a set period of time after which if the enemy has not taken your vip out of the game you win the game
aaxwzvogyxs_5-5-rgb_front like bunkers it is very easy to get trapped in a structure like this and not be able to get back out
aaxwzvogyxs_6-5-rgb_front so one of the things you want to try to remember is what is your evasion plan going to be
aaxwzvogyxs_7-5-rgb_front if you are overwhelmed from this position how are you going to get out and get away on that side
aaxwzvogyxs_8-5-rgb_front that is the key to not getting shot inside a bunker or a fort
abvr3kfxfrw_10-5-rgb_front as there are chances of getting the wooden particles and getting into the food when your cutting any food on the wooden cutting board
abvr3kfxfrw_11-5-rgb_front we should always make sure that the fiber cutting board is always clean before and after use
abvr3kfxfrw_12-5-rgb_front we should never cut any food preparation on a table top cause as it may make your knife bland
abvr3kfxfrw_5-5-rgb_front these are international standards but when you are cutting or handling any ready to eat food it should be handle using a gloves
abvr3kfxfrw_6-5-rgb_front we are going to grab a regular cutting knife for cutting onion we should always make sure that the knife is sharp before you start cutting the vegetable
abvr3kfxfrw_7-5-rgb_front as that there more chances of cutting your fingers with a bland knife then a sharp knife
abvr3kfxfrw_8-5-rgb_front we are going to need a cutting board
abvr3kfxfrw_9-5-rgb_front make sure that he cutting board is a fiber cutting board and not a wooden cutting board
ac9p3lkuyu0_2-3-rgb_front there are lots of online suppliers that you can buy from
ac9p3lkuyu0_3-3-rgb_front good quality henna is always kept refrigerated and it is fresh and usually dated by the year that it is harvested
acoz5zi3k1s_1-3-rgb_front we have been talking about how to wear your wigs how to take care of them how to store them
acoz5zi3k1s_10-3-rgb_front the cap does help keep your wig clean but it is not necessary
acoz5zi3k1s_2-3-rgb_front one of the things that i always tell people is if you do not like to wear a cap underneath your wig do not
acoz5zi3k1s_3-3-rgb_front there is no right or wrong way to do it
acoz5zi3k1s_4-3-rgb_front you know just make sure your hair is neatly tucked in under your wig and play with it
acoz5zi3k1s_5-3-rgb_front some people really need the cap to feel that security that it gives you
acoz5zi3k1s_6-3-rgb_front some people it drives them crazy you know play with it and see what works best for you
acoz5zi3k1s_7-3-rgb_front you want to be comfortable you want to be able to wear your wig and have fun with it and just be comfortable with it
acoz5zi3k1s_8-3-rgb_front you do not want it to be a nescient so if the cap is bothering your if it is making your head feel really tight take it off
acoz5zi3k1s_9-3-rgb_front it is not going to make your wig look back it is not going to hurt it at all
acc-dzptdo4_0-5-rgb_front yolanda vanveen hi
acc-dzptdo4_10-5-rgb_front so i am not afraid to buy bulbs that have a little bit of a shoot
acc-dzptdo4_11-5-rgb_front sometimes if it is really tall and falling over and it does not look that good the greenery then i would still buy it cause the bulb is what matters
acc-dzptdo4_12-5-rgb_front so you can always cut off the greenery
acc-dzptdo4_13-5-rgb_front you might not get a bloom this year but you still got a bulb for years to come
acc-dzptdo4_14-5-rgb_front and if there is no sign of growth but it is still firm it is still fine as long as it is firm and it is not mushy that is the deal
acc-dzptdo4_15-5-rgb_front plants like amaryllis belladonnas they are kind of a soft bulb kinda spongy even so sometimes people will say how come it is spongy
acc-dzptdo4_16_17_18_19-5-rgb_front what is wrong with it and i always tell them there is nothing wrong with it it is a fine bulb it looks alive
acc-dzptdo4_2-5-rgb_front next i am going to talk about how to select flower bulbs
acc-dzptdo4_20-5-rgb_front i can always take my fingernail and kinda rub a part of it and it is still gotten like a potato inside
acc-dzptdo4_21-5-rgb_front this bulb is fine
acc-dzptdo4_22-5-rgb_front if it was dry or black or mushy then it would be no good
acc-dzptdo4_23-5-rgb_front these are scilla peruvianas or cuban lilies they call them sometimes
acc-dzptdo4_24-5-rgb_front they have got a shoot they do not bloom till april or may so even in the winter time middle of winter i plant them and they are great cause the foliage will come out and they will look really good even through the winter
acc-dzptdo4_25-5-rgb_front this looks like a fine bulb
acc-dzptdo4_26-5-rgb_front there are lots of babies so i got quadruplets
acc-dzptdo4_27-5-rgb_front so instead of a mom and babies i have got quadruplets
acc-dzptdo4_28-5-rgb_front so there have been a lot of scientific studies done that say keeping bulbs in family units they produce much better than one by itself or just separating one or mixing them up with other bulbs but if you try to keep them even when dividing into same groups they seem to do much better
acc-dzptdo4_29-5-rgb_front daffodils are beautiful plants too
acc-dzptdo4_3-5-rgb_front when you are at the farmers market or the grocery store or anywhere where you actually have the choice to pick out a flower bulb there are different things that i look for to find out if it is a good flower bulb and if it is going to produce for me
acc-dzptdo4_30-5-rgb_front same thing if you have got a mama and a baby that is a bonus bulb
acc-dzptdo4_31-5-rgb_front you have got a family unit and she is going to do much better and you are going to have many many many more plants over the years
acc-dzptdo4_32-5-rgb_front so those are a few tips on selecting bulbs
acc-dzptdo4_33-5-rgb_front let is talk about what kinds of problems or what should i do if the bulb does not look very good
acc-dzptdo4_4-5-rgb_front tulip bulbs are pretty simple to check out
acc-dzptdo4_5-5-rgb_front if it looks like a hershey is kiss candy it is firm it is got a nice point to it it looks like some roots are actually starting to grow on it this is considered a good bulb
acc-dzptdo4_6-5-rgb_front these are alliums they are in the onion family
acc-dzptdo4_7-5-rgb_front if it looks kinda fleshy it is got paper on it although even the paper around the bulb if it is gone and the bulb still looks fine it is still a fine bulb there is nothing wrong with it
acc-dzptdo4_8-5-rgb_front i got dutch iris it is already staring to shoot
acc-dzptdo4_9-5-rgb_front well it is january and i want it to bloom this spring so it is a great bulb to pick out for right now and even if it had a little bit of a shoot in the fall over the winter my irises are very hardy that even if it freezes or there is snow on them there is a little shoot coming out of the ground in the middle of winter it does not hurt them at all
ad-fbewpd3s_0-8-rgb_front in this exercise we will be working the hamstrings very heavily
ad-fbewpd3s_1-8-rgb_front what we are going to do is begin by putting the ball under our legs and laying flat on our back
ad-fbewpd3s_10-8-rgb_front exhale
ad-fbewpd3s_11-8-rgb_front close the ribcage and come up
ad-fbewpd3s_12-8-rgb_front inhale
ad-fbewpd3s_13-8-rgb_front hold
ad-fbewpd3s_14-8-rgb_front exhale
ad-fbewpd3s_15-8-rgb_front push the ball out
ad-fbewpd3s_16-8-rgb_front inhale
ad-fbewpd3s_17-8-rgb_front bring it in and come down
ad-fbewpd3s_18-8-rgb_front exhale
ad-fbewpd3s_19-8-rgb_front up
ad-fbewpd3s_2-8-rgb_front so support the abs
ad-fbewpd3s_20-8-rgb_front inhale
ad-fbewpd3s_21-8-rgb_front hold
ad-fbewpd3s_22-8-rgb_front exhale
ad-fbewpd3s_23-8-rgb_front out
ad-fbewpd3s_24-8-rgb_front inhale
ad-fbewpd3s_25-8-rgb_front in
ad-fbewpd3s_26-8-rgb_front and exhale down
ad-fbewpd3s_27-8-rgb_front now this exercise can be advanced by doing it with just one leg
ad-fbewpd3s_3-8-rgb_front close the ribcage
ad-fbewpd3s_4-8-rgb_front curl down to come flat on your back and bring the ball under your legs
ad-fbewpd3s_5-8-rgb_front from here extend the ball out to ninety degrees
ad-fbewpd3s_6-8-rgb_front now you want your feet kind of on the side of the ball
ad-fbewpd3s_7-8-rgb_front we are going to go ahead and bridge up in one move
ad-fbewpd3s_8-8-rgb_front rather than articulate the spine
ad-fbewpd3s_9-8-rgb_front so take a nice inhale
ad13srgliym_5-9-rgb_front chipping the ball is not a very hard skill to learn
ad13srgliym_6-9-rgb_front it just takes practice
ad13srgliym_7-9-rgb_front when practicing just remember to aim for the bottom part of the ball letting your foot get completely underneath it so that the ball can come up in the air and that is how you chip a soccer ball
ad7kmdiuigo_1-5-rgb_front this clip is about writing a story
ad7kmdiuigo_10-5-rgb_front it s not enough for me to tell you that coach k is one of the most successful coaches in the history of college basketball
ad7kmdiuigo_11-5-rgb_front it is not new information if i tell you that bobby knight has a temper
ad7kmdiuigo_12-5-rgb_front so i have to tell you why bobby knight has a temper
ad7kmdiuigo_13-5-rgb_front i have to tell you why in this happened and bobby knight is been mad ever since
ad7kmdiuigo_14-5-rgb_front you have to tell the audience something that they do not know when you are writing a story
ad7kmdiuigo_15-5-rgb_front when you are writing an introduction to a story you want to tease them you want to bring them along slowly
ad7kmdiuigo_16-5-rgb_front you kind of want to leave gold coins
ad7kmdiuigo_17-5-rgb_front that s a phrase that i had a professor who used it
ad7kmdiuigo_18-5-rgb_front he calls it gold coins
ad7kmdiuigo_19-5-rgb_front when you are telling a story you want to drop gold coins that will catch the audience is attention or will make them even more interested in the story itself
ad7kmdiuigo_2-5-rgb_front when you are writing a story your best friends are either pen and paper or your fingers and a keyboard
ad7kmdiuigo_20-5-rgb_front so when writing a story remember in the lead the intro you kind of want to lead them into it tease them but do not give them too much information
ad7kmdiuigo_21-5-rgb_front but give them just enough that they want to keep watching
ad7kmdiuigo_22-5-rgb_front and during the story itself give them something they have never seen before or they might not know
ad7kmdiuigo_23-5-rgb_front that is the key to successful story telling telling the audience something that they do not already know
ad7kmdiuigo_24-5-rgb_front remember when you are doing a story on a basketball player try to to have footage of that basketball player
ad7kmdiuigo_25-5-rgb_front it is called b roll
ad7kmdiuigo_26-5-rgb_front you run that over the interview so that the audience can see what you are talking about
ad7kmdiuigo_27-5-rgb_front you can make your video match your audio
ad7kmdiuigo_28-5-rgb_front you can try to find this footage on satellite dish or server at your tv station or maybe the high school basketball coach has footage on this guy
ad7kmdiuigo_29-5-rgb_front so try to have footage of whatever it is you are talking about because it only enhances your
ad7kmdiuigo_3-5-rgb_front now we are getting electronic with it so you have palm pilots and other places that you can write a story
ad7kmdiuigo_30-5-rgb_front when you can match the audio to the video you can tell a successful story because then the audience can see what you are talking about
ad7kmdiuigo_31-5-rgb_front they do not have to rely on your words
ad7kmdiuigo_32-5-rgb_front they can see it
ad7kmdiuigo_33-5-rgb_front the proof is in the video
ad7kmdiuigo_34-5-rgb_front so remember that
ad7kmdiuigo_35-5-rgb_front successful lead them in give them something they do not already know have them have videos so they can match the audio so they can see it as well and be quick
ad7kmdiuigo_36-5-rgb_front be precise and be accurate
ad7kmdiuigo_37-5-rgb_front that is how you successfully write a story
ad7kmdiuigo_4-5-rgb_front but you have to be prepared
ad7kmdiuigo_5-5-rgb_front you always have to travel with a pen and notepad
ad7kmdiuigo_6-5-rgb_front even if you are an reporter you always have to be able to take notes
ad7kmdiuigo_7-5-rgb_front also work too
ad7kmdiuigo_8-5-rgb_front when you are writing a story you obviously want to get the who what when and the how
ad7kmdiuigo_9-5-rgb_front but the key to successful story telling is telling the audience something that they do not already know
ae7yb_kjluk_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to be learning how to play portal a game by valve software
ae7yb_kjluk_10-8-rgb_front after they bounce back and forth enough times they will dissipate and you will have to get another one
ae7yb_kjluk_11-8-rgb_front so you have to take that into account when you are thinking about transporting the balls from one place to another
ae7yb_kjluk_12-8-rgb_front now this orange portal is closed because we have not placed a blue portal yet
ae7yb_kjluk_13-8-rgb_front but as soon as we place a blue portal this will open and this ball will go into the orange portal and come out of the blue portal wherever we place it
ae7yb_kjluk_14-8-rgb_front so here is a power ball receptacle and what we want to do as the icon shows is get the ball to go into that thing
ae7yb_kjluk_15-8-rgb_front what we need to do then is place a blue portal above it so that when the power ball goes into the orange it will come out of the blue and go right into the receptacle
ae7yb_kjluk_16-8-rgb_front i guess it went in there while we were not looking and it activated this which lowered this elevator which we can get on
ae7yb_kjluk_17-8-rgb_front and now it is going to allow us to move on to the next test chamber
ae7yb_kjluk_18-8-rgb_front so this idea of placing portals at different places and times to get balls into the power generators is a critical concept to moving forward in the world of portal
ae7yb_kjluk_19-8-rgb_front and that is this test chamber
ae7yb_kjluk_2-8-rgb_front a company with which i have no affiliation
ae7yb_kjluk_3-8-rgb_front now here we are in the test chamber where things get a little bit more complicated still
ae7yb_kjluk_4-8-rgb_front we can see there is a new icon that lights up here
ae7yb_kjluk_5-8-rgb_front we have got this little circular energy ball which can hit me and kill me which is not a good thing
ae7yb_kjluk_6-8-rgb_front and then there is the circular energy ball can also go into a power conduit where the ball provides power to change something about the level
ae7yb_kjluk_7-8-rgb_front so from here on out we are going to have to be dealing with these things quite a bit
ae7yb_kjluk_8-8-rgb_front now if we look over here this is a power ball dispenser
ae7yb_kjluk_9-8-rgb_front and you can see that the power balls bounce back and forth between portals which are closed or the wall or the dispenser but they only last a certain amount of time
af2uwmxkdi4_0-5-rgb_front what is up guys
af2uwmxkdi4_2-5-rgb_front finally as we get down with our snowman here you know the snow is going to melt you are going to loose your snowman here so it is always really important if you are proud of the work that you did make sure you get some pictures done
af2uwmxkdi4_3-5-rgb_front get a bunch of pictures taken with you with your friends with the rest of the snow family everything to remember the snow man that you just built
af2uwmxkdi4_4-5-rgb_front even if you want to you can dress up as a snowman you can match him
af2uwmxkdi4_5-5-rgb_front put on another jersey and a bandanna whatever you like to do
afizcs0uo6u_0-8-rgb_front in our next clip we are going to discuss and i am going to show you some steps on trying to move in half a step
afizcs0uo6u_1-8-rgb_front everything i like to do in boxing i like to tell my boxers is to try to do it in just a half a step increment
afizcs0uo6u_10-8-rgb_front everything done in half steps
afizcs0uo6u_2-8-rgb_front half a step with one foot half a step with the other
afizcs0uo6u_3-8-rgb_front half a step with one foot half a step with the other
afizcs0uo6u_4-8-rgb_front if you take a full step with one foot and then a half a step with the other you are still too far spread apart
afizcs0uo6u_5-8-rgb_front your heels should be apart no less and only more when you are advancing okay
afizcs0uo6u_6-8-rgb_front so whether you are going to the side or whether you are going backwards or whether you are going to the other side or whether you are going forward try to do everything in little half a steps
afizcs0uo6u_7-8-rgb_front half a step with one foot follow it with a half a step with the other foot
afizcs0uo6u_8-8-rgb_front you are going to be less predictable that way
afizcs0uo6u_9-8-rgb_front you are going to get less tired that way
ag2-aeelqto_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is dave andrews today i am going to show you some tips on using a laptop computer
ag2-aeelqto_1-5-rgb_front now the first thing that i would do when using a laptop is to consider the surface that my laptop is going to be sitting on the majority of the time
ag2-aeelqto_10-5-rgb_front and also when you shut the top on your laptop that is going to cause it to go into standby mode
ag2-aeelqto_11-5-rgb_front when you open it back up it will recover from that standby mode
ag2-aeelqto_12-5-rgb_front my name is dave andrews and i have just given you some tips on using a laptop
ag2-aeelqto_2-5-rgb_front it requires that air get up under that laptop in order to blow hot air out and to keep the laptop from overheating
ag2-aeelqto_3-5-rgb_front another thing to consider when using your laptop is your battery life
ag2-aeelqto_4-5-rgb_front if you are going to be carrying your laptop around with you you are probably not going to leave it charged up or plugged into the charger all the time
ag2-aeelqto_5-5-rgb_front so you want to consider some things like when you are using a laptop maybe reduce the brightness on the screen a little bit i will pull something out so you can see
ag2-aeelqto_6-5-rgb_front that brightness is a little bit less and i am using a key combination on the laptop of the function key and on mine it is the f seven and f eight buttons that will increase and then decrease the brightness on that screen
ag2-aeelqto_7-5-rgb_front now what that is going to do is reduce the amount of energy is used to power your screen on your laptop and possibly make your battery life last longer
ag2-aeelqto_8-5-rgb_front now my next tip for you is when you are not using your laptop just shut the top on the laptop
ag2-aeelqto_9-5-rgb_front you do not want to leave that laptop on all the time because it will burn in an image on the screen after you know months and months of using it
ag3skyk_v1u_1-3-rgb_front today i will be talking about different gift ideas
ag3skyk_v1u_2-3-rgb_front first i will be talking about gift ideas for boyfriends
ag3skyk_v1u_3-3-rgb_front another great gift is a car sound system
ag3skyk_v1u_4-3-rgb_front they would usually range from about and over it just depends what kind you get
ag3skyk_v1u_5-3-rgb_front my boyfriend actually received that as a gift
ag3skyk_v1u_6-3-rgb_front he liked it a lot because he tended to like to show it off and that is mainly why he wanted so it kind of boost his ego a little bit
ag3skyk_v1u_7-3-rgb_front but they would love you if you bought them a sound system
ag3skyk_v1u_8-3-rgb_front make sure that it has a jack that you can plug an i pod in and the big speakers that go in the back
ag3skyk_v1u_9-3-rgb_front to make it even more extravagant you can add a dvd pop out player just all sorts of things if you want to go all out on this gift
agitfrfpmja_0-8-rgb_front alright we are going to explain a little bit about making spares
agitfrfpmja_1-8-rgb_front this is a one pin spare and it is the six pin it is on the right hand side of the lane
agitfrfpmja_10-8-rgb_front so practice and practice
agitfrfpmja_11-8-rgb_front the only way to learn every spare and there is hundreds of different types of spares you need to make so it takes a lot of practice
agitfrfpmja_12-8-rgb_front but find the right place to stand for every spare for your game
agitfrfpmja_13-8-rgb_front now i will show you i have a one a two and a six
agitfrfpmja_14-8-rgb_front now anytime i have the head pin up i will throw a strike ball okay
agitfrfpmja_15-8-rgb_front so if i got the head pin up most of the times i will throw my strike ball because that is going to take out the head pin and anything else
agitfrfpmja_16-8-rgb_front on this particular spare i know my game and i am going to move a little to the right try to let my ball go to the left hand side of that head pin so i am sure to make all three pins
agitfrfpmja_17-8-rgb_front that is nice when a plan comes together
agitfrfpmja_18-8-rgb_front do it right you will get it done
agitfrfpmja_2-8-rgb_front the best way to make a spare is cross alley
agitfrfpmja_3-8-rgb_front six pin is on the right hand lane so i am going to stand on the left
agitfrfpmja_4-8-rgb_front the four pin is the opposite side it is on the left hand i would stand on my right
agitfrfpmja_5-8-rgb_front let is show you how i make the six pin
agitfrfpmja_6-8-rgb_front i am going to stand all the way on the left hand part of the lane i am going to draw an imaginary line from the arrows to my pin
agitfrfpmja_7-8-rgb_front i am going to try to hit that line and make this pin
agitfrfpmja_8-8-rgb_front it is easy once you know the technique and draw that imaginary line you will make it
agitfrfpmja_9-8-rgb_front practice where every spare on the lane where you should stand for that spare
agitk8jgtwq_0-5-rgb_front this next collar style is a stand collar
agitk8jgtwq_1-5-rgb_front what we see this on typically would be like outer wear
agitk8jgtwq_10-5-rgb_front and what you are going to want to show if it is a stand collar and it needs to stand it needs to have reinforcement
agitk8jgtwq_11-5-rgb_front reinforcement is usually created by edge stitching which are the dashed lines
agitk8jgtwq_12-5-rgb_front if this and this are the same fabric and you want this piece to stand up more it just logically follows that you would have either that facing inside of it or you would edge stitch it to reinforce and make it stand up stiffer than the rest of the garment
agitk8jgtwq_2-5-rgb_front it could be on anything
agitk8jgtwq_3-5-rgb_front but like a jacket
agitk8jgtwq_4-5-rgb_front there you have a lapel well not a lapel this is one side of the jacket that comes over to this side of the jacket
agitk8jgtwq_5-5-rgb_front and the collar as i said before a stand is the rise
agitk8jgtwq_6-5-rgb_front the stand is the length from there to there
agitk8jgtwq_7-5-rgb_front that is your collar stand
agitk8jgtwq_8-5-rgb_front so then obviously if you think about if for a minute a stand collar is just that
agitk8jgtwq_9-5-rgb_front it is a separate piece attached to make a collar that just barely stands up from the actual garment itself
agpgs2moggq_0-8-rgb_front there is a neat little rule in hearts that involves a sort of managing your opponent is hand a bit in that the first deal the first hand of a game of hearts each player picks three cards to pass to their left
ahuc2fh-jfq_0-8-rgb_front it is very important to choose a wedding videographer that can work well with your photographer and vice versa
ahuc2fh-jfq_1-8-rgb_front choosing a photographer that works well with your videographer is also important because it can actually ruin a wedding day if a photographer and videographer are not getting along
ahuc2fh-jfq_10-8-rgb_front that is what they were hired to do
ahuc2fh-jfq_11-8-rgb_front they are hired to get still photography still photographs
ahuc2fh-jfq_12-8-rgb_front a videographer is role in a wedding video is to get the candid moments or movement in during the wedding day
ahuc2fh-jfq_13-8-rgb_front and so the videographer is kind of like the second hand person on the actual wedding day where they are kind of shooting behind the scenes and they re shooting what the photographer is doing with you on your wedding day
ahuc2fh-jfq_14-8-rgb_front and so you want to make sure that you do not get a videographer that tries to always jump in and take over everything
ahuc2fh-jfq_15-8-rgb_front tries to take over the photographer is role or tries to tell like family during family group shots where to stand
ahuc2fh-jfq_16-8-rgb_front that is just not cool because the photographer that is what the photographer is hired to do
ahuc2fh-jfq_17-8-rgb_front now what we do and probably what you should make sure your videographer does is we usually wait for the photographer to finish shooting and then he or she will say hey do you need to get any shots here
ahuc2fh-jfq_18-8-rgb_front and we say yes we need to get a few shots here
ahuc2fh-jfq_19-8-rgb_front and we will go ahead and then we will do our thing for a couple of minutes and then we move on
ahuc2fh-jfq_2-8-rgb_front so what you want to do is when you usually people hire their photographers first
ahuc2fh-jfq_20-8-rgb_front that is working well with a photographer and you want to make sure that your videographer works well with your photographer that way and does not try to take over everything
ahuc2fh-jfq_21-8-rgb_front because i know a lot of photographers that actually complain about the videographers that they have worked with because that is the how they are and they are always in their shots
ahuc2fh-jfq_22-8-rgb_front and they are too bossy and they can not get in their shots
ahuc2fh-jfq_23-8-rgb_front so it is very important to make sure that they work well together
ahuc2fh-jfq_3-8-rgb_front some people do not some people go to the videographer first
ahuc2fh-jfq_4-8-rgb_front but most of it is done through the photographer first
ahuc2fh-jfq_5-8-rgb_front ask your photographer for recommendations of who he or she believes that they would work well with
ahuc2fh-jfq_6-8-rgb_front they might even have people on their website that you can actually click on the links and visit those videographers
ahuc2fh-jfq_7-8-rgb_front or they might just have regular people that they always shoot with that they feel comfortable with and they know
ahuc2fh-jfq_8-8-rgb_front because typically on a wedding day what happens is the photographer is the one that should be in control the one that is screaming out the demands telling people where to stand telling people how to pose
ahuc2fh-jfq_9-8-rgb_front that is the photographer is job
ai092vehmru_0-8-rgb_front okay we want to talk just a little bit about basic maintenance on a tractor and obviously maintenance is a big issue
ai092vehmru_1-8-rgb_front but we want to touch on some of the fundamental tools of the trade and things that you need to know
ai092vehmru_10-8-rgb_front and then your engine oil which the filters visible on this side of the tractor but it is very similar to this
ai092vehmru_11-8-rgb_front again you will want to change that at least every one hundred hours with for this tractor a diesel grade engine oil is the most common grade
ai092vehmru_12-8-rgb_front and the proper new filter
ai092vehmru_13-8-rgb_front there is a lot more to it but those are the fundamentals
ai092vehmru_14-8-rgb_front on a diesel tractor they are much lower maintenance than a gasoline engine machine
ai092vehmru_15-8-rgb_front and if you just keep those fluids and filters cleaned keep all your pivot points lubricated you are going a long way toward keeping your tractor in tip top shape
ai092vehmru_2-8-rgb_front socket wrench grease gun and then clean fluid and filters are very important
ai092vehmru_3-8-rgb_front that is probably the single most important thing you can do on a diesel tractor is make sure you got clean fluid and filter
ai092vehmru_4-8-rgb_front so here we have got an oil filter air filter and fuel filter
ai092vehmru_5-8-rgb_front this will vary depending upon the tractor so refer to your manual or your dealer but for our tractors we recommend changing these three filters and the fluid associated with them every hundred hours
ai092vehmru_6-8-rgb_front one hundred hours
ai092vehmru_7-8-rgb_front your fuel filter you will see is visible through this clear site glass it allows you to see any water or sediment that is getting trapped in the bowl here
ai092vehmru_8-8-rgb_front your air filter on this tractor is right here that is something you may want to take out a lot more frequently than every one hundred hours and blow it out if it is got some dust on it
ai092vehmru_9-8-rgb_front but at least every one hundred hours or once a year you will want to change that out for a clean filter
ajpnfzd3upw_12-5-rgb_front well possum knows better than to be up on this couch but i asked her to get on this couch for this exercise
ajpnfzd3upw_13-5-rgb_front possum you know better than getting up here right
ajpnfzd3upw_14-5-rgb_front get down
ajpnfzd3upw_15-5-rgb_front good girl
ajpnfzd3upw_16-5-rgb_front good girl you did good girl come her come here
ajpnfzd3upw_17-5-rgb_front are you allowed up here
ajpnfzd3upw_18-5-rgb_front no you are not
ajpnfzd3upw_19-5-rgb_front we know better than to get up on the couch do not we
ajpnfzd3upw_20-5-rgb_front i came here and she had scraped up the leather really bad and i was so upset
ajpnfzd3upw_21-5-rgb_front i brought her in here and i made her get up her and then i said no
ajpnfzd3upw_22-5-rgb_front now she does not get up here without permission
ajpnfzd3upw_23-5-rgb_front you might have to train your dog in this fashion over and over or with a clap of then hands that will frighten them a little bit from getting up there
akf1llwn-o8_0-8-rgb_front i am going to talk a little now about trail maintenance
akf1llwn-o8_1-8-rgb_front this is a way that you can give back to the trail
akf1llwn-o8_2-8-rgb_front it is not just people walking on the trail that makes that trail
akf1llwn-o8_3-8-rgb_front there are people that have gone out and poured a lot of hard work and sweat into building the trails to put down water bars to cut down on erosion and cut up those logs that fall across the trail
akf1llwn-o8_4-8-rgb_front there are clubs that actually go out and do maintenance on these trails and it is a nice way to be social and hang out with other people who love the trail just like you and also make the trail a little bit nicer for the next persons that has got to hike through that section
akf1llwn-o8_5-8-rgb_front it can be done at any capacity just from cutting down some weeds to something as elaborate as building a bridge across a creek or putting boards across some marshy areas
akf1llwn-o8_6-8-rgb_front there is a lot that can be done and it is a great way to give back to the trail
aksbj8pedkq_0-8-rgb_front hi this is john stewart and this is how you can make and tie your own lasso trap for small animals with a shoe lace
aksbj8pedkq_1-8-rgb_front ok you are always going to have a shoe lace on you if you are having to survive out in nature and look for food easiest way to do it is to trap and kill it
aksbj8pedkq_2-8-rgb_front ok one way of doing this is the lasso trap
aksbj8pedkq_3-8-rgb_front what you got to do for this is find a shoe lace find a tall a branch or something that is low lying on the ground and find it near some animal tracks
aksbj8pedkq_5-8-rgb_front the trap is very easy to make like i said have a shoe lace you are going to have a couple of little branches that you can stick in the ground to prop up the loop to where they can run through it
alhtvmr3snw_0-5-rgb_front when you are talking about dribbling the basketball nothing looks more beautiful than a crossover dribble executed the right way but just for our drill sake we are going to start with the basics
alhtvmr3snw_1-5-rgb_front when you are doing a crossover dribble we are going to talk about the advanced techniques of doing a crossover dribble a little bit later but when you are doing a crossover dribble drill it is really basic
alhtvmr3snw_2-5-rgb_front you are just going to put the ball in your right hand and dribble in front of you over to the other hand
alhtvmr3snw_3-5-rgb_front a lot of times you want to be really careful and i have to be careful with this
alhtvmr3snw_4-5-rgb_front that you do not carry the ball because if you dribble across and you put your hand on the bottom of the ball that is called carrying
alhtvmr3snw_5-5-rgb_front if you continually dribble like this which a lot of guys these days tend to do but if you keep the ball in front of you and put your hand on the side of the ball and get moving and get a wide dribble a wide dribble a wide base when you do it
alhtvmr3snw_6-5-rgb_front you want to be careful not to carry
alhtvmr3snw_7-5-rgb_front we are going to talk a little bit later like i said a little bit later about the advanced ways to do this so that you can really use it effectively in the game but for right now we just want to show you how to do it so that you can get quick with it just get quicker with it
alhtvmr3snw_8-5-rgb_front so you can even use the same hand now and then which is what a lot of guys do when they get advanced but that is the way you do the crossover dribble
anme-t1nzk8_0-8-rgb_front okay the closed stance is demonstrated here
anme-t1nzk8_1-8-rgb_front we have this golf club here as being on line to my target and then this club here is parallel to that line and that is where i keep my feet
anme-t1nzk8_10-8-rgb_front it is a very nice shot and it depends of course on what the lie of the green is
anme-t1nzk8_11-8-rgb_front so the closed stance you want to you can practice you can use yardsticks or golf clubs or i have seen some people they have built a little device so they can keep the club
anme-t1nzk8_12-8-rgb_front they can stay closed and keep everything parallel and that way they can keep their shots on line a lot better
anme-t1nzk8_2-8-rgb_front so this is a closed stance and the goal here is i am going to have the club somewhat closed or somewhat neutral
anme-t1nzk8_3-8-rgb_front it is going to be perpendicular or at a right angle to the line of the flight
anme-t1nzk8_4-8-rgb_front so the goal here with the closed stance is everything is in line and i just take the club back like this and i swing
anme-t1nzk8_5-8-rgb_front so i just take it back and i hit that ball
anme-t1nzk8_6-8-rgb_front so the idea of a closed stance it is a way of i can put more true backspin on the ball possible a little side spin that will go to the left so i can keep the ball on line
anme-t1nzk8_7-8-rgb_front just like that
anme-t1nzk8_8-8-rgb_front so that ball stays really straight when i hit it
anme-t1nzk8_9-8-rgb_front so a closed stance is very useful
aozygjybzao_0-8-rgb_front hi there lady j here we are getting ready to mold some chocolates
aozygjybzao_1-8-rgb_front chocolate que rico
aozygjybzao_10-8-rgb_front no you can not see that chocolate
aozygjybzao_11-8-rgb_front let me show you a little bit closer can you see that chocolate that left over chocolate oooo yeah
aozygjybzao_12-8-rgb_front you know what before you get started make sure that your molds are washed
aozygjybzao_13-8-rgb_front after you wash them you are going to want to dry them
aozygjybzao_14-8-rgb_front so i am going to take a minute here and i am going to go wash my molds and we will be right back to talk to you guys about a few different ways to do it
aozygjybzao_15-8-rgb_front but then we are going to show you guys how we are going to do it today with our sweet little bottle right here
aozygjybzao_2-8-rgb_front ok so prepping the molds
aozygjybzao_3_4-8-rgb_front so you buy your molds you are going to want to wash that is kind of common sense there is some people out there that need that reminder
aozygjybzao_5-8-rgb_front wash your molds you never know who is been touching the molds and you know we will not go there
aozygjybzao_6-8-rgb_front so i actually sometimes will get really lazy i will be honest a little surprise surprise
aozygjybzao_7-8-rgb_front i will get lazy sometimes after i have made some chocolate and i have molded some chocolate i will my molds my plastic actually does not look all that dirty but it has some remnant i will give you an example of left over my last project you know left over chocolate
aozygjybzao_8-8-rgb_front example number one right there
aozygjybzao_9-8-rgb_front can you see that chocolate
ap4ktuygjye_0-8-rgb_front core exercises very popular
ap4ktuygjye_1-8-rgb_front this is a core exercise you can do any place you have got a floor
ap4ktuygjye_10-8-rgb_front so she is going to go onto her side
ap4ktuygjye_11-8-rgb_front she is going to put her weight on her elbow she going to straighten her legs up and now she is going to lift her torso up off the ground
ap4ktuygjye_12-8-rgb_front now you have got two choices here you can either hold it here or you can start to pulse up and down
ap4ktuygjye_13-8-rgb_front slowly and gently
ap4ktuygjye_14-8-rgb_front if you want a real challenge do not let your body touch the ground
ap4ktuygjye_15-8-rgb_front keep your butt off the ground at all times and try doing this thirty times
ap4ktuygjye_16-8-rgb_front and switch to the other side and do thirty times
ap4ktuygjye_17-8-rgb_front this is a side plank it is great for your side and your overall core stability
ap4ktuygjye_2-8-rgb_front so what amy is going to show you is a plank
ap4ktuygjye_3-8-rgb_front she is going to go down on her elbows and her hands and she is got her toes down
ap4ktuygjye_4-8-rgb_front she is going to breathe up and lift her body up bridging up and holding this
ap4ktuygjye_5-8-rgb_front she is going to make sure to keep breathing not hold her breath
ap4ktuygjye_6-8-rgb_front when she does this she is going to be working in her abdominals and actually up around the shoulder girdle
ap4ktuygjye_7-8-rgb_front so this is a deceptively good exercise
ap4ktuygjye_8-8-rgb_front this is called the plank
ap4ktuygjye_9-8-rgb_front now to make it even more fun we are going to take her into a side plank
apwx82zlo50_0-5-rgb_front oh hey
apwx82zlo50_1-5-rgb_front just in time
apwx82zlo50_10-5-rgb_front you can use avocado oil peanut oil baby oil olive oil
apwx82zlo50_11-5-rgb_front ovee as some like to say
apwx82zlo50_12-5-rgb_front but listen whatever type of oil you like to use
apwx82zlo50_13-5-rgb_front make sure you preheat it in a microwave
apwx82zlo50_14-5-rgb_front do not make it too hot
apwx82zlo50_15-5-rgb_front because we are applying it directly to the scalp
apwx82zlo50_16-5-rgb_front remember as you apply oil
apwx82zlo50_17-5-rgb_front it will get on the hair
apwx82zlo50_18-5-rgb_front so cover your head with a plastic cap
apwx82zlo50_19-5-rgb_front and remember keep it on for fifteen to twenty minutes
apwx82zlo50_2-5-rgb_front i was getting some stuff out of the way
apwx82zlo50_20-5-rgb_front if you choose go ahead and heat a towel
apwx82zlo50_21-5-rgb_front place that on your head as well
apwx82zlo50_22-5-rgb_front this will help to open up the cuticle and allow that moisture and oil to get deep down inside
apwx82zlo50_23-5-rgb_front last but not least remember rinse very well
apwx82zlo50_24-5-rgb_front shampoo first but rinse very well
apwx82zlo50_25-5-rgb_front follow up with leavening or a rinsing conditioning
apwx82zlo50_26-5-rgb_front thanks for watching
apwx82zlo50_27-5-rgb_front my name is sylvia russell
apwx82zlo50_28-5-rgb_front and this is how you can do a hot oil treatment
apwx82zlo50_3-5-rgb_front so that i can share with you
apwx82zlo50_4-5-rgb_front how to give a hot oil treatment
apwx82zlo50_5-5-rgb_front now if you are not already doing this at home this is something that you might want to try
apwx82zlo50_6-5-rgb_front it is excellent for moisture and shine
apwx82zlo50_7-5-rgb_front now what kind of oil are you going to use
apwx82zlo50_8-5-rgb_front there is several kinds out there
apwx82zlo50_9-5-rgb_front find something that works best for you
apldljtg2bo_1-1-rgb_front we are going to talk about screaming today in parrots
apldljtg2bo_10-1-rgb_front the bird is just happy that you are calling back
apldljtg2bo_11-1-rgb_front you are like oh my flock is in the other room he is calling back to me
apldljtg2bo_12-1-rgb_front you are just encouraging the behavior
apldljtg2bo_13-1-rgb_front the other way to encourage your bird or teach your bird to scream is every time they start screaming come back into the room and say no
apldljtg2bo_14-1-rgb_front they do not care i mean no does not mean anything to these birds
apldljtg2bo_15-1-rgb_front you need to find a form of distraction
apldljtg2bo_16-1-rgb_front if your bird screams every time you come out of the room you need to find some way to get the animal to have something else that s more motivating than your attention
apldljtg2bo_17_18-1-rgb_front one of these things can be foraging you can do so the bird is hungry suddenly when you leave the room either to go to work or if you need to get a task done you hide some treats in their cage and then you leave the room
apldljtg2bo_19-1-rgb_front every time you do this soon the bird will learn that you leaving the room means that there is going to be treats in the cage
apldljtg2bo_2-1-rgb_front now screaming in parrots or just excessive vocalization is normal
apldljtg2bo_20-1-rgb_front other things that you can do is one of the simpler things is you can come quietly do not say a word to the bird come in simply and just put a blanket over the cage
apldljtg2bo_21-1-rgb_front just for a few minutes just a time out
apldljtg2bo_22-1-rgb_front give that bird some time to realize that this is not negative suddenly again this is negative reinforcement and you want to try to avoid punishing the bird
apldljtg2bo_23-1-rgb_front you are just trying to discourage the behavior
apldljtg2bo_24-1-rgb_front the best way to do that is to find something that is more distracting and more entertaining than calling back to you
apldljtg2bo_25-1-rgb_front and the best way to keep your bird from screaming is to keep from encouraging it the first place
apldljtg2bo_26-1-rgb_front such as if your bird starts screaming in the first place do not come back into the room
apldljtg2bo_27-1-rgb_front wait until there is a quiet pause in the screaming come back into the room and reward the bird
apldljtg2bo_28-1-rgb_front reward him for being quiet
apldljtg2bo_3-1-rgb_front there is a point where it does not become normal
apldljtg2bo_4-1-rgb_front in the mornings and in the evenings most parrots will vocalize either scream give their normal jungle calls african grays and some of the other talking birds will beep and go through their vocabulary in the mornings and evenings
apldljtg2bo_5-1-rgb_front this is fairly normal
apldljtg2bo_6-1-rgb_front if you are not comfortable with this you probably should not have a bird
apldljtg2bo_7-1-rgb_front but there is a point where it becomes excessive where as soon as you walk out of the room the animal will just scream for attention and will not stop screaming until you get back into the room
apldljtg2bo_8-1-rgb_front so how do you modify this sort of behavior especially when the best way to reward that behavior is to scream back at your bird
apldljtg2bo_9-1-rgb_front you scream back shut up stop you know be quiet the bird does not care it does not understand those as negative
arlsdssfckg_0-5-rgb_front let is talk about pilling your dog
arlsdssfckg_1-5-rgb_front pilling your dog can be dangerous so be very very careful
arlsdssfckg_2-5-rgb_front you do not want to get in harms way if you can help it
arlsdssfckg_3-5-rgb_front there are lots of treats these days and one in particular that you can put the pill in and close over and it is a treat form of a medication
arlsdssfckg_4-5-rgb_front if you have to actually manually give your pet your dog a pill the best way to do it is if you can not use any treat or peanut butter or something like that is to take the pill itself with one hand and take your other hand and taking your thumb behind the right canine tooth that opens the mouth and then you can press the pill over the base of the tongue
asafa3cybuw_0-5-rgb_front now i will show you another design option for our panels
asafa3cybuw_1-5-rgb_front i will be using the same techniques of napkin decoupage with stickers to create a completely different design
asafa3cybuw_10-5-rgb_front and then when you come to a grassy section instead of cutting straight across that grassy section you want to cut grass
asafa3cybuw_11-5-rgb_front okay now i am going to just kind of cut straight here until i get down to another flower
asafa3cybuw_12-5-rgb_front and then i am going to cut the grass
asafa3cybuw_13-5-rgb_front and what you do is you just cut straight down in little diagonal snips like this
asafa3cybuw_14-5-rgb_front and this will give the effect of that green turning into grass
asafa3cybuw_15-5-rgb_front and do this all the way across the napkin as much space as you want
asafa3cybuw_16-5-rgb_front okay now when you have your foreground cut out
asafa3cybuw_17-5-rgb_front you have your napkin cut you
asafa3cybuw_18-5-rgb_front you see that we have turned an all over napkin into a nice piece of scenery
asafa3cybuw_19-5-rgb_front and we are going to glue that down with the decoupage glue
asafa3cybuw_2-5-rgb_front you will need for this pretty napkin
asafa3cybuw_20-5-rgb_front okay you always want to check that you have got all the layers of the backing of the napkin
asafa3cybuw_21-5-rgb_front and you take it down until you get a translucent you can see it is a very thin piece of napkin
asafa3cybuw_22-5-rgb_front okay now to apply our napkin we are first going to take the decoupage glue and put a thin layer of the glue on the board
asafa3cybuw_23-5-rgb_front you can use your hands for that
asafa3cybuw_24-5-rgb_front you can also use a paint brush for putting down that first thin layer of glue
asafa3cybuw_25-5-rgb_front when you are applying the napkin to the glue on the top then you want to use your finger or your hand so that you can feel how much pressure you are putting on the napkin
asafa3cybuw_26-5-rgb_front the paint brush is a little bit too rough for that
asafa3cybuw_27-5-rgb_front okay and then once you have that thin layer of glue you want to very carefully place it down on the glue patting it into place
asafa3cybuw_28-5-rgb_front and do not worry about a little bit of wrinkling
asafa3cybuw_29-5-rgb_front that is normal with the napkin
asafa3cybuw_3-5-rgb_front i am using a daisy napkin with an all over design of flowers and grass
asafa3cybuw_30-5-rgb_front and it adds a little bit of texture and character to the design
asafa3cybuw_31-5-rgb_front so just pat that down gently
asafa3cybuw_32-5-rgb_front and then we will glaze it over with some more of the decoupage glue
asafa3cybuw_33-5-rgb_front okay
asafa3cybuw_34-5-rgb_front and when you are gluing you want to very very gently make sure you have a lot of glue on your finger and it should be smooth and slick
asafa3cybuw_35-5-rgb_front now i have the grass like this and the flower petals i want to glue in an upward motion
asafa3cybuw_36-5-rgb_front you do not want to push it this way or you may tear your napkin
asafa3cybuw_37-5-rgb_front and then just put a good layer all around on the napkin and look for air bubbles
asafa3cybuw_38-5-rgb_front if you have air bubbles you want to put a little bit of glue there and kind of squish it out
asafa3cybuw_39-5-rgb_front but very very gently so you do not tear the napkin or get a hole in your design
asafa3cybuw_4-5-rgb_front i am using a sticker book that i picked up in the store and the decoupage glue
asafa3cybuw_5-5-rgb_front and you will need some scissors for cutting
asafa3cybuw_6-5-rgb_front okay i am going to use my daisy napkin here for the foreground and the base of a little fairy picnic
asafa3cybuw_7-5-rgb_front so to use an all over design like this that i only want to have on the bottom here to kind of show that they are going to be sitting in the garden i want to cut my napkin
asafa3cybuw_8-5-rgb_front but we do not want to cut straight across we want to use the design in the napkin
asafa3cybuw_9-5-rgb_front so what you do is cut out as you go along you cut out the flowers like this
asbwwmqtozc_0-8-rgb_front hi i am magician paul weatherby and here is a coin
asbwwmqtozc_1-8-rgb_front see the coin
asbwwmqtozc_2-8-rgb_front
asbwwmqtozc_20-8-rgb_front i hope you like it and have fun with it
asbwwmqtozc_21-8-rgb_front until next time keep the magic in your life

asbwwmqtozc_4-8-rgb_front well if i take the coin place the coin into my hand could i have you blow on it please
asfcljczbl4_0-8-rgb_front we are going to talk about the board performance techniques right now and these are the four actions that your board can do that we will perform on the snow
asfcljczbl4_1-8-rgb_front the four actions are tilt twist pivot and pressure
asfcljczbl4_10-8-rgb_front tilt twist pivot and pressure
asfcljczbl4_2-8-rgb_front when the board tilts we are talking about tilting the board one way or the other using your feet and ankles
asfcljczbl4_3-8-rgb_front twist is when you actually can twist the board
asfcljczbl4_4-8-rgb_front it might be tough to see on this because it is very very stiff
asfcljczbl4_5-8-rgb_front you can actually twist the board along its longitudinal axis
asfcljczbl4_6-8-rgb_front pivot when we pivot with the board we use our body to pivot the board this way
asfcljczbl4_7-8-rgb_front pressure pressure is where you load and unload the board
asfcljczbl4_8-8-rgb_front when i jump up in the air when i land i have a lot of pressure or if i lift myself up just before i leave the ground i am unloading or unweighting the board
asfcljczbl4_9-8-rgb_front those are the four board performance characteristics

aubqcnegryc_0-1-rgb_front gina kennedy balance poses can be very challenging and a little scary when they are upside down
aubqcnegryc_1-1-rgb_front through the use of blocks it can make the fear go right out of it or at least we hope so
aubqcnegryc_10-1-rgb_front then also we are going to take a block and place it under her feet
aubqcnegryc_11-1-rgb_front there
aubqcnegryc_12-1-rgb_front so basically she has more points to lean on and she does not have to worry about falling over
aubqcnegryc_13-1-rgb_front good
aubqcnegryc_14-1-rgb_front i am going to release the block and slowly come back down
aubqcnegryc_15-1-rgb_front good
aubqcnegryc_16-1-rgb_front so if that is still even a little scary for you you might try having a pillow in front and a pillow under your tail so you are not worried about falling over
aubqcnegryc_17-1-rgb_front because the key to arm balance poses is to lose your fear
aubqcnegryc_2-1-rgb_front so faith is going to help me demonstrate bakasana or the crane balance
aubqcnegryc_3-1-rgb_front so we are just going to have her come over to her hands and curl her toes under
aubqcnegryc_4-1-rgb_front yeah she is going to take her knees wide and place her hands in between her knees and spread her fingers nice and wide now notice how she bent her elbows and pull them to the insides of her knees
aubqcnegryc_5-1-rgb_front good
aubqcnegryc_6-1-rgb_front she is going to pull her belly in and lift her tailbone up and bring her knees to her upper arm bones
aubqcnegryc_7-1-rgb_front good
aubqcnegryc_8-1-rgb_front she is going to transfer her weight a little bit forward and just lean her head right on that block and what this does is takes the fear out of falling forward
aubqcnegryc_9-1-rgb_front good

awhvlsxsrck_0-8-rgb_front hello i am sifu mallon with the clearwater kung fu center this is my assistant melissa and this is women is self defense

awqtkhyfjwo_0-5-rgb_front where does ink come from
awqtkhyfjwo_1-5-rgb_front well obviously ink in many many forms has been around for quite some time thousands of years in fact
awqtkhyfjwo_2-5-rgb_front early chinese illustrators i guess for lack of a better word used to get their ink from different types of soot from fire combined with certain foods and from different animal skins and carcasses and could write or draw using that
awqtkhyfjwo_3-5-rgb_front today ink basically is a combination of different types of pigments dyes and it is used for many many things obviously in the world we live in not just for writing but for you know coloring the clothes we wear and basically anything that involves some form of color in this day and age on either printed materials or clothing or anything comes from a certain form of ink
aa3nsacjdqm_0-5-rgb_front the marine organism we are going to identify now is the nurse shark
aa3nsacjdqm_1-5-rgb_front the nurse shark is not your stereo typical tropical shark
aa3nsacjdqm_10-5-rgb_front they feed primarily at night by foraging through the sand for scrumptious morsels and food
aa3nsacjdqm_16-5-rgb_front they will also occasionally use their broad snout to dig into the sand like a shovel
aa3nsacjdqm_17-5-rgb_front one unique characteristic of the nurse shark that further sets it apart from most other sharks is that it does not need to be constantly swimming to get enough water over its gills to breathe effectively
aa3nsacjdqm_18-5-rgb_front instead the nurse shark has a special muscle that allows him to open and close its gill covers manually while resting on the bottom to pump water over their gills
aa3nsacjdqm_19-5-rgb_front nurse sharks can often be approached closely when they are resting on the bottom but any quick movement toward them or an attempt to reach out and touch them will usually caused them to quickly swim away just above the surface of the reef
aa3nsacjdqm_2-5-rgb_front they are bottom dwelling and feeding shark which can be commonly found resting on the bottom during the day in coral ravines under coral ledges or in caves
aa3nsacjdqm_20-5-rgb_front they post little threat to divers but i still would not stick my hand too close to their mouth
aa3nsacjdqm_21-5-rgb_front i have heard stories of although i have never witnessed it for myself of divers been bitten by nurse sharks usually when they are approached too closely or where divers pestering the shark
aa3nsacjdqm_22-5-rgb_front nurse shark males can be easily distinguished from females by the presence of two claspers located on either side of the underside of their body near the anal fin
aa3nsacjdqm_23-5-rgb_front nurse sharks mate in open water and the females carry the fetuses until they are born
aa3nsacjdqm_24-5-rgb_front litter sizes can reach up to as many as two dozen baby sharks at a time
aa3nsacjdqm_25-5-rgb_front the baby nurse shark when newly born are usually about a foot long and resemble the adult shark
aa3nsacjdqm_26-5-rgb_front gestation takes about six months and mating occurs just once every two years usually between late june and the end of july
aa3nsacjdqm_27-5-rgb_front that is the nurse shark
aa3nsacjdqm_3-5-rgb_front they are gray to a purplish or yellowish brown in color
aa3nsacjdqm_4-5-rgb_front nurse sharks have two relatively short dorsal fins and a tail with a long upper lobe and almost no lower lobe
aa3nsacjdqm_5-5-rgb_front they range in size from five to nine feet on average but have been reported to be found as long as fourteen feet
aa3nsacjdqm_6-5-rgb_front nurse sharks are generally found at depths shallower than a hundred feet
aa3nsacjdqm_7-5-rgb_front they are found throughout the waters in the caribbean and the tropical atlantic ocean
aa3nsacjdqm_8-5-rgb_front nurse sharks have a small mouth located underneath their head
aa3nsacjdqm_9-5-rgb_front their snout is broad and rounded
aabzs04yate_1-8-rgb_front i am an artist who discovered henna about seven years ago and i am fascinated with the beautiful designs that henna creates on the skin
abctdcoqjeq_6-5-rgb_front make sure the knife cuts through all of the fat
abctdcoqjeq_7-5-rgb_front i try and make the chunks all as even as i can so it will cook evenly
abctdcoqjeq_8-5-rgb_front i am going to move the chicken here into the oil and i am going to sautã this and we are going to reserve this plate because once the chicken is marked we will take it off but to ensure that we do not contaminate any other surface we are going to take the end of our glove here from the wrist and bring it into a ball
abctdcoqjeq_9-5-rgb_front grab that ball here and repeat and now we have not contaminated another surface with the raw chicken
achhlgzoxmk_0-8-rgb_front so porcelain the rate of shrinkage depending on the kind of porcelain that you are using the average rate of shrinkage is around thirteen percent
achhlgzoxmk_1-8-rgb_front so if you wanted to make an eight inch doll which is about what this is
achhlgzoxmk_13-8-rgb_front so this is my original sculpture that i used to get the eight inch doll
achhlgzoxmk_2-8-rgb_front in order to get that eight inch doll you would have to blow this up thirteen percent and this would be size of your porcelain to get this doll
achhlgzoxmk_3-8-rgb_front so if i wanted an eleven inch doll i would have this would be i would lay my pieces out
achhlgzoxmk_4-8-rgb_front so i always start two sizes up from the size that i want

admkaltfbgc_0-8-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson and what we are talking about right now is making sure that our forwards whether they are the power forward or whether they are the small forward they have got stay active within the offense
admkaltfbgc_1-8-rgb_front they have got to be able to move around and follow the ball know where the ball is all the time
admkaltfbgc_10-8-rgb_front now if we can not get him in the post if he skips the ball across our post player has to know that
admkaltfbgc_11-8-rgb_front then he is going to flash up high to the elbow area and that is going to give him a limited area to shoot in
admkaltfbgc_12-8-rgb_front so what we want to see him do is the post is going to work the bottom of the post he is going to work the high post area the elbow on the other side
admkaltfbgc_13-8-rgb_front he is got to keep moving and he is also got to know where the ball is at all times on the court so that he can get active in the offense and he can get a shot away
admkaltfbgc_14-8-rgb_front and that is how to effectively use your forwards in the offense
admkaltfbgc_2-8-rgb_front for one they are looking to get a shot for two they are looking to keep the offense running smoothly
admkaltfbgc_3-8-rgb_front so what we are going to talk about right now is we are going to use our power forward that is posted up on the block
admkaltfbgc_4-8-rgb_front he has to make sure that he knows where the ball is right now
admkaltfbgc_5-8-rgb_front if the ball is on the top of the key it does not do him much good to post up because we do not want a throw to go from the top of the key to the post unless he is absolutely wide open
admkaltfbgc_6-8-rgb_front if everybody is dropped off of him and we can get him the ball we will throw it from here but this is a horrible passing angle to get it to the post
admkaltfbgc_7-8-rgb_front so typically what we want him to do is either he is going to set a screen across or he is going to flash up to the high post
admkaltfbgc_8-8-rgb_front now if i can not get him the ball in the high post i am going to go ahead and move the ball to the wing
admkaltfbgc_9-8-rgb_front as i move the ball to the wing then he is going to go and try to post up because that is the passing angle we want to get it to our post player
aewpnji88kw_0-5-rgb_front so now both of my base and my lid had set up to the leather of our stage
aewpnji88kw_1-5-rgb_front what that means is if i rub it with my finger i am not going to create a indention but if i stick a fingernail in i get a indention really easily
aewpnji88kw_10-5-rgb_front so i would take my ribbon tool which is call a ribbon tool because it creates a ribbon of clay
aewpnji88kw_11-5-rgb_front i do not need to take off very much just a little amount and then i would check my lid fit again
aewpnji88kw_12-5-rgb_front now it sits nicely on the pot so i would show you the next steps of finishing the lid
aewpnji88kw_2-5-rgb_front it is about the consistency of hard cheese
aewpnji88kw_3-5-rgb_front so i am going to check my lid fit with my base by flipping it over
aewpnji88kw_4-5-rgb_front i have not cut it off yet and it is just a little bit too big
aewpnji88kw_5-5-rgb_front so what i am going to do is show you how you can fix that problem
aewpnji88kw_6-5-rgb_front it is a lot better to have a lid that is a little bit too big then a little bit too small because you can trim a lid that is a little bit too big and you can not make a lid that is to small any bigger
aewpnji88kw_7-5-rgb_front so you put it back on the wheel now you see it looks wobbly that is because the bat pin hole in my bat are not perfectly symmetrical so i need to spin this around degrees
aewpnji88kw_8-5-rgb_front and try again
aewpnji88kw_9-5-rgb_front now it is on center
ah-pm4tolj4_0-5-rgb_front hi
ah-pm4tolj4_10-5-rgb_front i am going to attach that to my piece
ah-pm4tolj4_11-5-rgb_front smooth it out
ah-pm4tolj4_12-5-rgb_front then i am going to do the same
ah-pm4tolj4_13-5-rgb_front i am going to tear some more
ah-pm4tolj4_14-5-rgb_front this one is a bit longer and we will just attach that down
ah-pm4tolj4_15-5-rgb_front and smooth it out
ah-pm4tolj4_16-5-rgb_front now this time since i have been going this way
ah-pm4tolj4_17-5-rgb_front i am going to do some and go the opposite way
ah-pm4tolj4_18-5-rgb_front just to make it look a little bit more like a zebra
ah-pm4tolj4_19-5-rgb_front that piece did not really work out for me
ah-pm4tolj4_2-5-rgb_front another great thing masking tape is for is for creating zebra stripes
ah-pm4tolj4_20-5-rgb_front so i will try it again
ah-pm4tolj4_21-5-rgb_front so after we have done this a couple times all i am simply going to do is paint good coats of really whatever color you want
ah-pm4tolj4_22-5-rgb_front you do not have to have black and white zebra
ah-pm4tolj4_23-5-rgb_front you can have a neon purple and yellow zebra if you want
ah-pm4tolj4_24-5-rgb_front you can have any zebra you can possibly imagine
ah-pm4tolj4_25-5-rgb_front so once we have a couple stripes all i am simply going to do is start my painting
ah-pm4tolj4_26-5-rgb_front so i have got a couple here
ah-pm4tolj4_27-5-rgb_front generally i would do a bit more
ah-pm4tolj4_28-5-rgb_front now i am actually going to use the same color
ah-pm4tolj4_29-5-rgb_front we are going to have a turquoise zebra today
ah-pm4tolj4_3-5-rgb_front which is very very popular right now
ah-pm4tolj4_30-5-rgb_front so all i am going to do is i am going to dunk my paintbrush back in to my paint
ah-pm4tolj4_31-5-rgb_front make sure all my paint is smooth and simply paint directly on top of my tape
ah-pm4tolj4_32-5-rgb_front this is really fun to do not only on flat surfaces but on round
ah-pm4tolj4_33-5-rgb_front i see these a lot on mugs and having the zebra stripes go up and down rather than horizontal it looks really really great
ah-pm4tolj4_34-5-rgb_front and you can do it on almost any any piece
ah-pm4tolj4_35-5-rgb_front which is really really nice
ah-pm4tolj4_36-5-rgb_front you also do not have to have them just one or two colors
ah-pm4tolj4_37-5-rgb_front you can introduce or colors by taping each section off
ah-pm4tolj4_38-5-rgb_front applying a different color underneath and then reapplying tap and adding more color
ah-pm4tolj4_39-5-rgb_front so now all i am going to do is i am going to remove my tape
ah-pm4tolj4_4-5-rgb_front the way we create zebra stripes is
ah-pm4tolj4_40-5-rgb_front and wherever my tape was is actually going to stay white
ah-pm4tolj4_41-5-rgb_front so when i remove my tape we can start to see the formation of the zebra stripes
ah-pm4tolj4_42-5-rgb_front and it is as simple as that
ah-pm4tolj4_5-5-rgb_front i am going to use the same tile except i am going to use the opposite side
ah-pm4tolj4_6-5-rgb_front so to do zebra stripes all i am going to do is take some masking tape tear some off and then i am just going to simply strip the masking tape in to sections
ah-pm4tolj4_7-5-rgb_front and what i am going to try to do is i am going to try to tear it so that it ends in a point
ah-pm4tolj4_8-5-rgb_front so we just tear it like that
ah-pm4tolj4_9-5-rgb_front so i have got a little stripe here
ahfpp9gyuhe_1-8-rgb_front okay so now we are going to make crab cakes some fantastic crab cakes i am mean they are out of this world but personally what i think the topping that is going to set this receipt aside from all others is the crab meat sauce that i am going to teach you how to prepare
ahfpp9gyuhe_2-8-rgb_front it is very simple we are going to use only lump crab meat which is the white meat of the crab instead of using the darker parts and bits and pieces we are going to use lump crab meat which is going to give you a sweet succulent crab cake topped with a outrageous sauce that is really going to hook your guest
ahfpp9gyuhe_3-8-rgb_front my family is like addicted to it if i do not make it for every holiday they get really upset
ahki1p2lqpi_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is guillermo gomez i coach youth soccer and today i am going to be explaining to you a little bit how to kick a
ahki1p2lqpi_1-8-rgb_front so what is a
ahki1p2lqpi_10-8-rgb_front i emphasize on both left and right so if they took a kick with their left they will kick with their left first and then when the ball comes back to them they will do that with their right that way they get into the habit of using both feet to work on every kind of techniques for kicking the soccer ball
ahki1p2lqpi_11-8-rgb_front so to summarize again you want to hold the ball you want to watch your timing timing as the ball comes down you want to look at the ball so keep an eye good close eye on the ball that is very important and then the ball comes down bounces before he takes a big bounce up you actually want to come forward kick the ball and land with your kicking foot
ahki1p2lqpi_12-8-rgb_front so that is how you can do you can practice a and have fun with it while you are at the park with your friends
ahki1p2lqpi_2-8-rgb_front a is actually when the ball comes at you it is about to touch the ground it actually touches the ground and as soon as the ball does that you actually kick the ball
ahki1p2lqpi_3-8-rgb_front so it is important that as soon as the ball touches the ground that you watch the ball does it bounce up
ahki1p2lqpi_4-8-rgb_front because then you will miss that ball and again you might look a little funny if you are out there with your friends
ahki1p2lqpi_5-8-rgb_front so what are the proper body mechanics when you kick a
ahki1p2lqpi_6-8-rgb_front well first you want to approach the ball at a slight angle your supporting foot comes a little bit behind the foot about six inches away from the ball your kicking foot is going to approach the ball pointing your toes down locking the ankle and you are going to be kicking the ball with your shoelace
ahki1p2lqpi_7-8-rgb_front with your shoulders going backwards so the motion is or the idea is to actually lift the ball a little bit but not too much and you want to strike the ball right underneath with your toes pointing down so you can either score a goal or send the ball to one of your teammates
ahki1p2lqpi_8-8-rgb_front a good way to practice a is actually to have two players face each other you put them about ten yards apart from each other you want the players to hold the ball on their hands so for this purposes we are going to use one ball only
ahki1p2lqpi_9-8-rgb_front the player holds the ball he drops the ball and as the ball touches the ground and tries to bounce up a little bit you want to kick the ball in forward motion by landing with your kicking foot as soon as you have sent the ball to your teammate your teammate will catch the ball with his hands and you will repeat the exercise exactly the same way
aibmw4xt7wa_0-4-rgb_front cindy mastry in this clip faith is going to help me demonstrate a really great way to release tension and stretch your shoulders using the strap
aibmw4xt7wa_1-4-rgb_front so i am going to give faith a strap then she is just going to stand with her feet about a little bit wider than distance apart and she is going to reach her arms up and try to find a v good
aibmw4xt7wa_10-4-rgb_front good
aibmw4xt7wa_11-4-rgb_front widening her shoulder blades away from each other
aibmw4xt7wa_12-4-rgb_front inhale reaching the arms up to the sky exhale opening up through her shoulders through her rotator cuff and dropping the arms down behind
aibmw4xt7wa_13-4-rgb_front good
aibmw4xt7wa_14-4-rgb_front inhaling lifting them up breathing your spine long as you do so and exhaling dropping her shoulders down
aibmw4xt7wa_2-4-rgb_front so we are going to ask her to rotate on the diagonal just a little bit
aibmw4xt7wa_3-4-rgb_front good
aibmw4xt7wa_4-4-rgb_front she is going to drop her hands down and place them next to her hips keeping that same width and tension on the strap
aibmw4xt7wa_5-4-rgb_front because she is going to inhale reach the arms up to the sky dropping her shoulders out of her ears and placing her shoulder blades down her back
aibmw4xt7wa_6-4-rgb_front and then she is going to take the strap back behind on her exhalation so dropping it all the way down to her hips
aibmw4xt7wa_7-4-rgb_front good
aibmw4xt7wa_8-4-rgb_front and notice how that opens up her chest opens up her shoulders
aibmw4xt7wa_9-4-rgb_front inhaling lifting her arms up to the sky and as she exhales bringing them back down to her hips
ajzza5okrvc_0-5-rgb_front doug jenkins hi i am doug
ajzza5okrvc_2-5-rgb_front now ralph is working away to get the bumper square on the car
ajzza5okrvc_3-5-rgb_front the car was restored originally with a crooked frame
ajzza5okrvc_4-5-rgb_front now we have got the frame straight so the bumper does not sit straight on the car they had the car crooked they got the bumper looking good on the car
ajzza5okrvc_5-5-rgb_front now we have got the car straight it does not fit square
ajzza5okrvc_6-5-rgb_front so ralph is modifying the bumper mount making holes larger and changing them so that he can get know nice looking straight mount on the bumper
ajzza5okrvc_7-5-rgb_front so painting and handy work there so everything looks good when we are done
ajzza5okrvc_8-5-rgb_front and when he gets the gets the bumper mounted up there he will be moving it with you know the chains and jack and everything to get it exactly straight on the car
alf9dejhzxm_0-8-rgb_front this next exercise is part of a mid back series that is also done on the reformer
alf9dejhzxm_1-8-rgb_front we are going to use the theraband to mimic the straps on the reformer
alf9dejhzxm_2-8-rgb_front so go ahead and take the theraband and make it a shawl around your back checking the tension here you are going to have your arms straight so you want enough tension so that you feel a little bit of the work
alf9dejhzxm_3-8-rgb_front we are going to start in table top position so go ahead and curl back down on to the mat supporting your head if you need to and bring your legs up into table top
alf9dejhzxm_4-8-rgb_front with this exercise you can do it without ever lifting the torso but i will demonstrate both lifting the torso and without so take a nice inhale and exhale crunch the abdominals down to the mat bring the arms down and inhale around exhale down inhale around and then if you want to advance it a little bit more inhale tuck the chin exhale down inhale around exhale down inhale around exhale down inhale around and reverse exhale out inhale pull in exhale out inhale pull in
alsoytcpxas_0-8-rgb_front let is talk about pairing wine with spicy food specifically red wines
alsoytcpxas_1-8-rgb_front if we are going to pair red wine with spicy food you are probably talking about a nice rich dish made with pork or maybe with beef
alsoytcpxas_10-8-rgb_front it is actually the same grape and it will have just the same amount of spice as shiraz
alsoytcpxas_11-8-rgb_front so the main rule for pairing red wine with spicy food is keep it rich and heavy and find a spicy red wine
alsoytcpxas_2-8-rgb_front maybe a blackened beef tenderloin or maybe a chicken molet or a cumin crusted pork roast or maybe a curry with beef
alsoytcpxas_3-8-rgb_front the best red wine pairings for these dishes are red wines with spice in them some sort of a spicy flavor to them in themselves
alsoytcpxas_4-8-rgb_front you also might want to stick with a wine that is got low tannin so that we do not have a salt and tannin clash
alsoytcpxas_5-8-rgb_front so among the best red wines to pair with spicy foods are the spicy red wines like zinfandel especially one from california or from lodine
alsoytcpxas_6-8-rgb_front maybe a malbec from argentina
alsoytcpxas_7-8-rgb_front maybe a merlot from just about any place in the world or one of the best bets for a spicy match which is shiraz
alsoytcpxas_8-8-rgb_front some of the best shirazes come from australia and they can be very very spicy indeed
alsoytcpxas_9-8-rgb_front if you can not find an australian shiraz look for a syrah from france or california
amlbhkcnuwe_1-3-rgb_front but before i start let me introduce myself
amlbhkcnuwe_2-3-rgb_front i am a clinical research physician in the area of oncology which is cancer and also a stem cell scientist in aids and hiv and i have worked at the national cancer institute and also at ucla school of medicine
amlbhkcnuwe_3-3-rgb_front now in these series of clips we are going to talk as i talked about as i have mentioned about restless leg syndrome and we are going to talk about first the definition of restless leg syndrome the signs and symptoms that you can recognize and also some of the treatment options and ways that you could help to elevate the symptoms of this particular syndrome
anxhvqxvpgs_1-5-rgb_front today i am going to be making creamy tomato basil soup
anxhvqxvpgs_10-5-rgb_front it adds a nice tartness to the soup
anxhvqxvpgs_11-5-rgb_front i like to follow that up with just a few drops of extra virgin olive oil the good stuff if you have got it
anxhvqxvpgs_12-5-rgb_front lastly what i will do is take a peeler and some fresh parmesan cheese and i will just shave some parmesan cheese right off the block and into the soup
anxhvqxvpgs_13-5-rgb_front take a peeler and just nice thin wispy strands
anxhvqxvpgs_14-5-rgb_front do not go too deep
anxhvqxvpgs_15-5-rgb_front that piece is a little too big so what we will do is break it up into some smaller pieces just really small light pieces
anxhvqxvpgs_16-5-rgb_front you do not want this to overpower the soup you want it to become part of the soup
anxhvqxvpgs_17-5-rgb_front toast points or roasted peppers work well on this one
anxhvqxvpgs_18-5-rgb_front there is my fairly quick tomato basil soup
anxhvqxvpgs_19-5-rgb_front you can make it a little faster if you use nothing but canned tomatoes which i do not recommend
anxhvqxvpgs_2-5-rgb_front let is get some of this in a bowl and i will show you my favorite way to present it
anxhvqxvpgs_20-5-rgb_front you can actually save a lot of time on cooking them because if you use the canned peeled tomatoes they do not have to break down as much
anxhvqxvpgs_21-5-rgb_front if you are trying to make it in a hurry that is a good way to go but typically you are not going to get as good of a product
anxhvqxvpgs_22-5-rgb_front you can also mix up your tomatoes do half yellow half red or do a combination of red green and yellow to change the flavors
anxhvqxvpgs_23-5-rgb_front you could garnish this with grilled green tomato which is really nice looking
anxhvqxvpgs_24-5-rgb_front all in all it is a really spectacular soup
anxhvqxvpgs_25-5-rgb_front it is one of my favorites it is very very popular
anxhvqxvpgs_26-5-rgb_front it goes great with grilled cheese sandwiches which is why we all like tomato soup anyway
anxhvqxvpgs_28-5-rgb_front have a good one
anxhvqxvpgs_3-5-rgb_front if you let the soup sit for a while what you always want to do is give it a good stir before you put it in the bowl
anxhvqxvpgs_4-5-rgb_front you do this because some of your seasonings can sink to the bottom or you can get a skin on top depending on how long you let it sit
anxhvqxvpgs_5-5-rgb_front this sat for a couple of minutes so not that much has happened to it
anxhvqxvpgs_6-5-rgb_front i still gave it a good stir just to make sure
anxhvqxvpgs_7-5-rgb_front here is our soup
anxhvqxvpgs_8-5-rgb_front there are a couple of things i like to do with it
anxhvqxvpgs_9-5-rgb_front i like to sprinkle just a tiny bit of balsamic vinegar just a few drops
ao4eesd6r44_0-5-rgb_front in this clip now that we have loosened and got as much slack as we can in the throttle and idle cable what you can do now on a lot of carbs too that have a fuel line we will just pull that out and then what you will do is start to rock the carb back and forth
ao4eesd6r44_1-5-rgb_front ok now that we got the carburetor off the manifold be careful about banging up against the engine
ao4eesd6r44_10-5-rgb_front the idle cable has a little spring insert
ao4eesd6r44_11-5-rgb_front that is what the pick is good for
ao4eesd6r44_12-5-rgb_front you just kind of pull it up in there now you can pull that down and get that cable out
ao4eesd6r44_13-5-rgb_front alright now that we got the choke cable out of the way we got the throttle and idles out of the way there is a vacuum hose connected to the back that goes to the voes switch and the vacuum operated pet cock
ao4eesd6r44_14-5-rgb_front you need to disconnect that
ao4eesd6r44_15-5-rgb_front alrighty one carb she is done and we put her out of the way and start working on the rest of the manifold
ao4eesd6r44_2-5-rgb_front you want to pay attention to where the choke cable went because you want to feed the choke cable out in between the bracket
ao4eesd6r44_3-5-rgb_front there is a bracket back there sometimes that is guiding the fuel line and there is a voes switch in there
ao4eesd6r44_4-5-rgb_front this is an evo so that is how it advances the timing
ao4eesd6r44_5-5-rgb_front now that we have got it lose you just pull the cable up over and out of the top bracket clip it out
ao4eesd6r44_6-5-rgb_front you want to be really careful with these cables here
ao4eesd6r44_7-5-rgb_front you can kink them
ao4eesd6r44_8-5-rgb_front if you try to force it what happens is usually the end of the cable is riding outside of this bracket here so it does not really let you move the cam back to get the cable out
ao4eesd6r44_9-5-rgb_front now that was the throttle cable
ao9gdnegtgq_1-5-rgb_front posture is very important as a model you want to maintain proper posture at all times because it reflects on your confidence as a model
ao9gdnegtgq_2-5-rgb_front having proper posture is a factor of how confidence you are and what doing
ao9gdnegtgq_3-5-rgb_front so a basic proper posture stance would be having your shoulders back but relaxed tuck your butt under and suck in your abdomen that is a proper posture line
ao9gdnegtgq_4-5-rgb_front lift your chin up but not too far up and the best way to practice this is to put a book on your head walk around the house
ao9gdnegtgq_5-5-rgb_front if the book falls off then you have correct posture but if the book remains on your head you could walk up the stairs down the stairs and do whatever doing your posture is very good
ao9gdnegtgq_6-5-rgb_front now posture is like i said a reflection of how confident you are because your confidence level is based on your posture
ao9gdnegtgq_7-5-rgb_front if you slumped you know not very confident and people see that but if standing up straight or sitting up straight telling you ready to do this i can do this
ao9gdnegtgq_8-5-rgb_front so practice these things and going to reflect in your pictures and on set and how you deliver everything that you do
ao9gdnegtgq_9-5-rgb_front thank you for visiting me today you may visit my website at www myspace have a great day

aomlhmr9plq_0-8-rgb_front now what we are going to talk about today is after you make contact what do you do
aomlhmr9plq_1-8-rgb_front do you make contact and then drop the bat
aomlhmr9plq_10-8-rgb_front so what you want to do is come through here boom we make contact keep driving through keep driving through and then you go through your follow through
aomlhmr9plq_11-8-rgb_front it it does not make a lot of sense people do not say why do you keep pushing through it seems weird but i can not tell you the physics but for some reason it works
aomlhmr9plq_12-8-rgb_front so make sure all you have got to do boom you make contact keep driving through and that was the point of contact and after the point of contact
aomlhmr9plq_2-8-rgb_front do you continue through do you roll your hands over
aomlhmr9plq_3-8-rgb_front what in this general vicinity from here to here what are you supposed to do
aomlhmr9plq_4-8-rgb_front well as we have talked about you get your solid base your ready to go you got your timing boom
aomlhmr9plq_5-8-rgb_front i made contact with the ball here
aomlhmr9plq_6-8-rgb_front now all i want to do is continue to push basically push forward as far as i can until i have to come back across my back
aomlhmr9plq_7-8-rgb_front if you start to do things like make contact and then just kind of let it fly like that
aomlhmr9plq_8-8-rgb_front what you are going to do is your going to ground out weak little grounders third base man short stop something like that
aomlhmr9plq_9-8-rgb_front if you go here after contact you just kind of let it fall either you are going to foul it off hit a weak grounder to the first base man something like that
aopx3cjx5-q_0-1-rgb_front okay this sculpture is heart and soul it is completed
aopx3cjx5-q_1-1-rgb_front and we are going to take it over to the foundry and they have to make a mold of it
aopx3cjx5-q_10-1-rgb_front so you have to create what they call a mother mold
aopx3cjx5-q_11-1-rgb_front take plaster and they start painting the plaster on top of this mold and they start adding burlap to it because you want to make the plaster a very strong and durable
aopx3cjx5-q_12-1-rgb_front you could drop it on the floor and it will not break
aopx3cjx5-q_13-1-rgb_front now this piece is the heart and soul piece
aopx3cjx5-q_14-1-rgb_front it has the mother mold on it already
aopx3cjx5-q_15-1-rgb_front so what we would so is we would take this and lift it off and the original clay is still in here
aopx3cjx5-q_16-1-rgb_front and these little bubbles here are so the mother mold will match up with this mold
aopx3cjx5-q_17-1-rgb_front and also there is little bubbles under here because you want this mold to match up with the other mold and then when they are together again i will explain that in a minute
aopx3cjx5-q_18-1-rgb_front they have painted this on and now we have a mold of the sculpture and it shows up everything
aopx3cjx5-q_19-1-rgb_front in this particular sculpture we only had to make up one mold on some of my other ones we had to make up to three molds or four molds of one sculpture
aopx3cjx5-q_2-1-rgb_front so we will show you the process of how they make the mold and we will go from there
aopx3cjx5-q_20-1-rgb_front so what we do is we just take the clay out take the mother mold off this
aopx3cjx5-q_21-1-rgb_front we no longer need the clay any more the clay is finished
aopx3cjx5-q_3-1-rgb_front so now when we make the mold there is in this edition
aopx3cjx5-q_4-1-rgb_front so they are going to be pouring wax into the mold different times
aopx3cjx5-q_5-1-rgb_front alright so what they do is they take the sculpture piece and they lay it flat and they are going to start painting on rubber latex rubber
aopx3cjx5-q_6-1-rgb_front and it takes at least a week to do this because well this is a rubber mold from another sculpture that i did
aopx3cjx5-q_7-1-rgb_front and you can see how thick it is and you have to wait for the layers to dry before you make it
aopx3cjx5-q_8-1-rgb_front but once let is say this piece is lying on the sculpture piece and you just keep painting it on and painting it on and painting it on until it becomes thick enough
aopx3cjx5-q_9-1-rgb_front but if you notice you can not really use this mold because it is too flimsy
apcuun08bqc_1-2-rgb_front i like before applying the top coat to the french i like to put a hint of pink on the nail
apcuun08bqc_2-2-rgb_front when you put on nail bed right here right before the white tip it brings down the nail bed and makes it look more natural
apcuun08bqc_3-2-rgb_front then you apply the top coat
apcuun08bqc_4-2-rgb_front top coat is just a clear coat that protects the nail and the polish so client would have the nail longer and not warned out it also shines up the nail
apcuun08bqc_5-2-rgb_front when you apply top coat make sure you do not put to much of top coat on your brush then it clumps
apcuun08bqc_6-2-rgb_front just enough then if you do to much top coat and it clumps it may cause bubbles
apcuun08bqc_7-2-rgb_front so right here is just enough top coat and it would look shiny for a while for you client and they would be happy
apme2w12uwo_1-8-rgb_front before we paint on the glass we are going to clean the glass so we have to get to the glass
apme2w12uwo_10-8-rgb_front so i am just going to hit one spray on this side
apme2w12uwo_11-8-rgb_front just get all the streaks out
apme2w12uwo_12-8-rgb_front all right
apme2w12uwo_13-8-rgb_front and then once the glass is clean i am just going to try and keep my grubby fingertips off of it
apme2w12uwo_14-8-rgb_front set that there bring the frame back into the pun then i am just going to set this back in there like that
apme2w12uwo_15-8-rgb_front and that is cleaning the glass for painting
apme2w12uwo_2-8-rgb_front so we are just going to take the back of this frame out and remove the paper and the various things that come with it
apme2w12uwo_3-8-rgb_front and be careful when you work with glass especially these glasses in the frames because unlike this glass door over here this glass that comes with this is really thin
apme2w12uwo_4-8-rgb_front so what i am going to do is just very gingerly carefully remove the glass and just set it on the cardboard
apme2w12uwo_5-8-rgb_front and then i am going to set the frame to the side just for a second while i clean it and just take glass cleaner will do fine
apme2w12uwo_6-8-rgb_front you do not need a ton just like one little spray and then just clean the glass so we have a nice surface to work on
apme2w12uwo_7-8-rgb_front your paper towels will probably try to run away but that is all right
apme2w12uwo_8-8-rgb_front okay and then once you get that side you can flip to the other side
apme2w12uwo_9-8-rgb_front the frames in the stores tend to collect a lot of dust and fingerprints and so forth
asnjolvpsoq_0-8-rgb_front to become a psychologist you first need to major in usually psychology in your under graduate career
asnjolvpsoq_1-8-rgb_front the under graduate is a four year course study that you would do in a college or university
asnjolvpsoq_10-8-rgb_front there is research psychology there is chronicle psychology
asnjolvpsoq_11-8-rgb_front and depending on what it is you wish to do
asnjolvpsoq_12-8-rgb_front will determine your course of study
asnjolvpsoq_13-8-rgb_front but let is focus on chronicle psychologist
asnjolvpsoq_14-8-rgb_front as that is what you are most familiar with
asnjolvpsoq_15-8-rgb_front a chronicle psychologist is a person who engages in therapy with patients
asnjolvpsoq_16-8-rgb_front to help them with emotional problems
asnjolvpsoq_17-8-rgb_front it should be noted that a psychologist is different than a psychiatrist
asnjolvpsoq_18-8-rgb_front psychiatrist is a medical specialty and requires a medical degree
asnjolvpsoq_19-8-rgb_front psychiatrist are allowed to prescribe medicines
asnjolvpsoq_2-8-rgb_front after completing your bachelor is degree in psychology
asnjolvpsoq_20-8-rgb_front and typically do not focus on therapy
asnjolvpsoq_21-8-rgb_front psychologists are not allowed to prescribe medicines
asnjolvpsoq_22-8-rgb_front and really focus primarily on therapy with the patients
asnjolvpsoq_23-8-rgb_front once you have completed your graduate training on psychology
asnjolvpsoq_24-8-rgb_front typically there are some period of internship
asnjolvpsoq_25-8-rgb_front in which you will work with practicing psychologists
asnjolvpsoq_26-8-rgb_front under their supervision you learn your clinical skills
asnjolvpsoq_27-8-rgb_front and will be ready to take the state license exam
asnjolvpsoq_28-8-rgb_front once you have taken the state license exam and passed successfully
asnjolvpsoq_29-8-rgb_front you will be ready to practice independently as a psychologist
asnjolvpsoq_3-8-rgb_front before you can become a practicing psychologist
asnjolvpsoq_4-8-rgb_front you need to go to graduate school
asnjolvpsoq_5-8-rgb_front to do this you first must take the graduate entrance exam or the gre
asnjolvpsoq_6-8-rgb_front and apply to psychology programs
asnjolvpsoq_7-8-rgb_front psychology is a the doctorate program in psychology is a four year course of study
asnjolvpsoq_8-8-rgb_front and upon completion you would obtain the degree of phd
asnjolvpsoq_9-8-rgb_front there are different areas of psychology
atqrrcf_xxw_1-8-rgb_front we are picking peaches now
atqrrcf_xxw_10-8-rgb_front so first and foremost smell nice and fruity feel nice and tender and you want to make sure there is no discoloration of any kind
atqrrcf_xxw_11-8-rgb_front you guys will have good peaches every time single times if you follow these simple simple steps guys and make sure not to store in the refrigerator again okay
atqrrcf_xxw_12-8-rgb_front another thing i want to tell you actually is if you live somewhere that grows produce you want to definitely buy from a local grower rather than buying from a big chain store
atqrrcf_xxw_13-8-rgb_front a lot of times these big chain stores just want to get their produce in and out and sell them as quick as possible so they are going to buy the produced unripe and they are going to hope they ripe on the way to the store and that is what they do
atqrrcf_xxw_14-8-rgb_front so these local farmers usually do not put their produce until it is nice and ripe so look out for that guys
atqrrcf_xxw_15-8-rgb_front thank you and have a good day
atqrrcf_xxw_2-8-rgb_front a peach should smell very good first and foremost it should have a nice fruity smell to it
atqrrcf_xxw_3-8-rgb_front if it does not have a fruity smell it is not ripe so make sure you pick it up and smell it
atqrrcf_xxw_4-8-rgb_front you want to get your peach and pick it and you want to feel your peach
atqrrcf_xxw_5-8-rgb_front you want to feel your peach and make sure that it has a nice slight pressure like this one does you do not want to push it too hard though you do not want to bruise your peach guys be very gentle with the peach
atqrrcf_xxw_6-8-rgb_front you want to make sure there is no discoloration of the peach you do not want to see any really really dark moldy looking spots you want it to be nice and clean like this one
atqrrcf_xxw_7-8-rgb_front feel it again make sure it is nice all the way around and you should have good peaches all the time
atqrrcf_xxw_8-8-rgb_front you want to store your peach outside of the refrigerator not in the refrigerator
atqrrcf_xxw_9-8-rgb_front a lot of people make that mistake
aty4pljzc1i_0-4-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson and what we are talking about right now is when is the proper time to use particular passes
aty4pljzc1i_1-4-rgb_front and what we want to talk about right now is the bounce pass
aty4pljzc1i_10-4-rgb_front but if he is coming on the fast break and he throws a good bounce pass to this guy on the fast break it is really hard to get down while a defender is running back to get down and defend that bounce pass
aty4pljzc1i_11-4-rgb_front he can catch it low and go up and score it
aty4pljzc1i_12-4-rgb_front so usually on a fast break it is much better to use a bounce pass than it is a chest pass because it is so much harder to defend
aty4pljzc1i_13-4-rgb_front the last one we want to talk about is go ahead and have you post kick it out
aty4pljzc1i_14-4-rgb_front you come play defense
aty4pljzc1i_15-4-rgb_front and whether this guy plays him on the bottom side or the top side most of the time it is easier to fake and to throw a good low bounce pass instead of a chest pass because already he is got his hand in there
aty4pljzc1i_16-4-rgb_front he wants to play this guy in the middle not on the bottom
aty4pljzc1i_17-4-rgb_front so if kyle can throw him a low bounce pass to the top it is much easier for him to work that way off a bounce pass than it is off of a chest pass
aty4pljzc1i_18-4-rgb_front and the same thing if he was fronting him high we would have the bounce pass come and wrap around low
aty4pljzc1i_19-4-rgb_front so the bounce pass is a really good pass to feed the post and to run the fast break
aty4pljzc1i_2-4-rgb_front bounce passes are very effective
aty4pljzc1i_3-4-rgb_front about the only time you do not want to use a bounce pass is when you are throwing from the top of the key to the perimeter
aty4pljzc1i_4-4-rgb_front those are long passes
aty4pljzc1i_5-4-rgb_front any time you are throwing a really long pass you do not want to use a bounce pass
aty4pljzc1i_6-4-rgb_front it is easy for a defender to come out and steel
aty4pljzc1i_7-4-rgb_front however if we got these three guys that are running a break typically you want to use a bounce pass for this reason
aty4pljzc1i_8-4-rgb_front if i am a defender and i am trying to defend this fast break and i come back if he throws a chest pass here it is real easy for me to come out and knock that chest pass away
aty4pljzc1i_9-4-rgb_front give it back to him
auzkzvihtue_0-5-rgb_front all right the next thing that you want to be careful about is humor
auzkzvihtue_1-5-rgb_front as always my rule is if you are not funny do not try to be
auzkzvihtue_2-5-rgb_front however you might think you are funny because you are a little intoxicated
auzkzvihtue_3-5-rgb_front but be very careful about the humor that you use especially if you are using humor at someone else is expense like we talked about in the last clip
auzkzvihtue_4-5-rgb_front you have to keep in mind and i know i keep saying this over and over but you have to keep in mind that whatever you say is going to be filtered through potentially inebriated guests
auzkzvihtue_5-5-rgb_front so be real careful about humor because some humor depending on the situation and the way in which you use it could end up being offensive
auzkzvihtue_6-5-rgb_front you do not want to overuse humor either
auzkzvihtue_7-5-rgb_front you might make one funny statement or one funny joke but do not let it be applicable to any specific situation
auzkzvihtue_8-5-rgb_front however on the other hand because your guests could potentially be inebriated this could be that you have been saving up this really funny line that you have been wanting to use for ten years
auzkzvihtue_9-5-rgb_front well you might based on the situation throw it out there because they are probably not going to remember the speech two minutes after you are done anyway
av-klzbg3hi_0-5-rgb_front this style of collar is called a flower collar
av-klzbg3hi_1-5-rgb_front that is because the shape that it brings to mind is that of the petals of a flower
av-klzbg3hi_2-5-rgb_front being as such a flower has softened petals it has some curvature to it
av-klzbg3hi_3-5-rgb_front the flower collar does not mean that it is a floofy flower it means that right here we have the beginnings of a petal that is what the silhouette represents is the soft lines of a flower of the flowers petals
av-klzbg3hi_4-5-rgb_front the top part of the collar is just like your regular standard basic old collar and then i have it edge stitched because you are embellishing and you are creating something that has more of a personal look to it
av-klzbg3hi_5-5-rgb_front it is not just a regular old lapel regular jack it is a flower lapel jacket so therefore the edge stitching just makes it a little bit more elegant
axmuhvgrwrs_0-8-rgb_front hi
axmuhvgrwrs_1-8-rgb_front i am robert stewart with com
axmuhvgrwrs_10-8-rgb_front if you can not get your mask on and get clear vision ask a referee to take you from the field
axmuhvgrwrs_2-8-rgb_front the next thing we are going to talk about is the lenses on your mask
axmuhvgrwrs_3-8-rgb_front now depending upon the manufacturer and the features you have added to it that might or might not affect how you care for it especially if you are using any kind of liners on your goggles
axmuhvgrwrs_4-8-rgb_front when you pick the mask up and look on the box it should say whether or not it has the finish
axmuhvgrwrs_5-8-rgb_front always remember to use cleaners for your mask
axmuhvgrwrs_6-8-rgb_front otherwise you may damage the coating and defeat the purpose altogether
axmuhvgrwrs_7-8-rgb_front now if you are using any kind of field mask make sure when you first check your mask out that it is fit and adjusted properly for your face
axmuhvgrwrs_8-8-rgb_front this is very important because if it is improperly fitted and you are running jumping and diving to the ground the mask could slip off of your head
axmuhvgrwrs_9-8-rgb_front now should this happen remember get low to the ground keep your face protected until you get your mask back on
aygp09d7z_w_0-5-rgb_front now we have learned how to hit a ball inside we have learned how to hit a ball outside we have learned how to hit a ball up
aygp09d7z_w_1-5-rgb_front now what is the next natural progression
aygp09d7z_w_10-5-rgb_front so what you want to do when you are hitting a ball that is down
aygp09d7z_w_11-5-rgb_front go through all your steps boom you are ready to swing you still want to stay on top of the ball
aygp09d7z_w_12-5-rgb_front now i know what you are thinking
aygp09d7z_w_13-5-rgb_front why do i want to stay on top of a ball if it is already down
aygp09d7z_w_14-5-rgb_front i am just going to pound it into the ground
aygp09d7z_w_15-5-rgb_front no you are still going to hit the line drive
aygp09d7z_w_16-5-rgb_front you want to stay on top of the ball at all times
aygp09d7z_w_17-5-rgb_front it does not matter if the ball is at my feet or if the ball is above my head i want to be on top of the ball
aygp09d7z_w_18-5-rgb_front so here we go
aygp09d7z_w_19-5-rgb_front here is hitting the ball down
aygp09d7z_w_2-5-rgb_front we are going to hit the ball down
aygp09d7z_w_20-5-rgb_front boom through my steps right there as you can see
aygp09d7z_w_21-5-rgb_front if i was making contact the ball would be just above my knee
aygp09d7z_w_22-5-rgb_front still a strike the ball is down hands are below the baseball and on top of the ball
aygp09d7z_w_23-5-rgb_front you hit that hard line drive that hard ground ball that gets through the hole
aygp09d7z_w_24-5-rgb_front that is hitting the ball down
aygp09d7z_w_3-5-rgb_front if up is from the waist to your chest then down is from the waist to your knees
aygp09d7z_w_4-5-rgb_front now again we are going to talk about some of the things some of the common mistakes that people do
aygp09d7z_w_5-5-rgb_front they do one of either two things
aygp09d7z_w_6-5-rgb_front they either drop down and so oh that ball is down i need to try and get under it and what do they do
aygp09d7z_w_7-5-rgb_front they hit a pop fly
aygp09d7z_w_8-5-rgb_front or they just say ahh i am not going to hit a ball down they let it go
aygp09d7z_w_9-5-rgb_front well you know what if the ball is right here it is still a strike so there is no point in letting the ball go if it is down
azqqsfntggs_0-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to show you how to apply hair color for hair touch up
azqqsfntggs_1-5-rgb_front so the hair touch up regrowth of the hair is when you come in and you already have full color on your hair and your roots are showing
azqqsfntggs_2-5-rgb_front i for example am going to show you my head for a minute what it looks like
azqqsfntggs_3-5-rgb_front i have two toned hair right now and decided not to do my hair color to show you
azqqsfntggs_4-5-rgb_front as you see here the roots of my hair are darker it has gray hair about twenty five percent gray and i have here lighter hair and lighter shades of hair so if i were to touch up my hair i would only to the root here
azqqsfntggs_5-5-rgb_front so the application for that would be just me hitting the root of my hair just going like this and putting it on the root of the hair exactly where it belongs
azqqsfntggs_6-5-rgb_front o k so the application we do it on the root do not overlap on the hair i would not want to go over my light hair because then it is going to get lighter and it is not going to look as nice
azqqsfntggs_7-5-rgb_front o k so no overlapping
azqqsfntggs_8-5-rgb_front that means just not going over the previously colored hair just touching the root that is why it is called a retouch on new growth of hair
aziklbi09ug_0-8-rgb_front if you use a natural nail tip you are actually going to need to blend the artificial tip in with the natural nail
aziklbi09ug_1-8-rgb_front with that you will just take your drill or your regular nail file if you do not have an electric one and just kind of go over the tip itself just to blend it in with the natural nail
aziklbi09ug_2-8-rgb_front you are not actually going to rough up the nail anymore
aziklbi09ug_3-8-rgb_front you are just going to blend it in
aziklbi09ug_4-8-rgb_front on the french tip you do not do that because it is already got the nice smile line and you do not need it blended any
aziklbi09ug_5-8-rgb_front again this is just for the natural tip
aziklbi09ug_6-8-rgb_front and again if you do not have an electric nail file you can do the same thing with a regular nail file
aziklbi09ug_7-8-rgb_front you just want to blend the tip such as this and even though it is going to be on the nail itself you are not going to file the actual nail you are just filing the tip
aziklbi09ug_8-8-rgb_front and you just want to blend it all the way from one side to the other
aziklbi09ug_9-8-rgb_front and that is how you blend the natural nail tip with the natural nail
azmxjenwcxo_1-5-rgb_front part of renting a tuxedo is also having the proper footwear
azmxjenwcxo_10-5-rgb_front some people do not like that shiny glossy look kind of plastic look
azmxjenwcxo_11-5-rgb_front sometimes you can buy a shoe that is a little more of a dull finish
azmxjenwcxo_12-5-rgb_front there is no right or wrong way to go it is just kind of personal taste
azmxjenwcxo_13-5-rgb_front popular over the last couple years has been more of a square toe i think fashion is changing on that a little bit and going more with a point toe
azmxjenwcxo_14-5-rgb_front so that another thing to be aware of that fashions change
azmxjenwcxo_15-5-rgb_front that is why i say maybe go conservative that is always going to look good
azmxjenwcxo_16-5-rgb_front this you might at a few years down the road and say gee that is kind of a square toe i wish we had done something a little more up to date
azmxjenwcxo_17-5-rgb_front so go conservative when in doubt
azmxjenwcxo_2-5-rgb_front it is not unusual to have people wear their own shoes if they want to i always think it is best to rent a shoe to go with the tuxedo you picked
azmxjenwcxo_3-5-rgb_front you are spending a lot of money for that tuxedo you do not want a pair of shoes that distracts from that overall tuxedo look
azmxjenwcxo_4-5-rgb_front there is a lot of ways you can go on tuxedos every tuxedo will have different styles of shoes
azmxjenwcxo_5-5-rgb_front there is always just the plain flat front tuxedo high gloss
azmxjenwcxo_6-5-rgb_front that is a classic way to go you will always find that in any tuxedo place you go to and that is the good way to go
azmxjenwcxo_7-5-rgb_front but it is not unusual to do some different looks
azmxjenwcxo_8-5-rgb_front this is a cap toe shoe
azmxjenwcxo_9-5-rgb_front so you can do cap toe wing tip there is a lot of different options on that

b-atx2kxgcy_2-3-rgb_front and there are two really top ones because they both allow you to pay in canadian currency and not have to pay in american currency and transfer it over
b-atx2kxgcy_3-3-rgb_front so first there is canadianpersonals which lets you create a free profile and again it is all definitely just canadian money and canadian dollars
b-atx2kxgcy_4-3-rgb_front there is a number of scheduled events in numerous cities hosted by actual members that it tells you about so it gives you more ways to connect
b-atx2kxgcy_5-3-rgb_front and it tells you if any members have been inactive and so it keeps a very close watch on what is actually happening

b-klhket2d4_0-2-rgb_front hi i am ginger walker owner of clean junkies
b-klhket2d4_1-2-rgb_front we are going to talk today about how to wash your blue jeans the proper way to wash your blue jeans
b-klhket2d4_10-2-rgb_front but also again with the friction of jeans that is going to wear down the denim and and cause you to get holes easier and that type of things so stick with about four pairs of jeans
b-klhket2d4_11-2-rgb_front obviously if they are little jeans you can put a few more in there but the heavier the material the more wear you are going to get on your washer
b-klhket2d4_12-2-rgb_front okay when we put in our blue jeans we are going to make want to make sure that we put it on a heavy duty setting or you can use your normal setting
b-klhket2d4_13-2-rgb_front the one thing that you want to pay attention to when you are doing your darks is your temperature
b-klhket2d4_14-2-rgb_front you want to make sure that you are using cold water so that you can retain the color in your jeans
b-klhket2d4_15-2-rgb_front if you have got a really dark jean you definitely want to use cold
b-klhket2d4_16-2-rgb_front if you have got a lighter jean an acid wash something like that you can use a warm setting but the best thing to do is always use cold then you are set you do not have to worry about it
b-klhket2d4_17-2-rgb_front okay when your jeans are done washing you will get those out
b-klhket2d4_18-2-rgb_front now you can go ahead and throw your jeans in the dryer if you do not mind you know the color is going to fade eventually or a lot of people will hang dry their jeans
b-klhket2d4_19-2-rgb_front the best thing to do is turn them right side out again give them a good shake and hand them over something you know you can use as long as it does not can not rust you can use whatever you like
b-klhket2d4_2-2-rgb_front when you are washing your blue jeans you want to make sure you are going to check your pockets we are good on this one
b-klhket2d4_20-2-rgb_front so just give them a good hang there let them air dry
b-klhket2d4_21-2-rgb_front when they are done air drying if you do not like that stiff feeling that the air drying will give you you can throw them in the dryer for about ten minutes on a warm setting and it will give you a nice soft feeling again
b-klhket2d4_3-2-rgb_front and you always turn your blue jeans inside out
b-klhket2d4_4-2-rgb_front the reason for that is when you wash blue jeans generally you are washing them together and the friction that the blue jeans have on each other wears the color down
b-klhket2d4_5-2-rgb_front so if you turn them inside out you are not going to get as much of that
b-klhket2d4_6-2-rgb_front ah sucker sticks cell phones keys and chap stick of course
b-klhket2d4_7-2-rgb_front so it is very important to always check your pockets
b-klhket2d4_8-2-rgb_front turn your jeans inside out
b-klhket2d4_9-2-rgb_front when you are washing blue jeans you do not want to wash more than four pair at a time and the reason why is it is such heavy fabric that your washer it can really wear on your washer
b-pyyuyz1v4_0-2-rgb_front my name is lauren and today i am going to discuss how to dye black hair
b-pyyuyz1v4_1-2-rgb_front if your hair is naturally very dark brown or black you are going you can use an at home coloring system
b-pyyuyz1v4_10-2-rgb_front you are not going to put it down you are not going to place it down bring it back with the rest of the hair what happens is you get little spots on the under lying hair which can make it look very stripy or leopardy
b-pyyuyz1v4_11-2-rgb_front so you are going to paint lift and release
b-pyyuyz1v4_12-2-rgb_front you can also put regular color on your hair from root to end although i would not suggest doing major change at home
b-pyyuyz1v4_13-2-rgb_front if your hair is colored black the only way for you to get that color out is to go to a salon and get it professionally done
b-pyyuyz1v4_14-2-rgb_front salons carry either hair color removers which will lift any deposited hair color out of the hair while keeping the natural hair color in tact
b-pyyuyz1v4_15-2-rgb_front or you can get your hair highlighted in order to start to lighten it up
b-pyyuyz1v4_16-2-rgb_front it will be impossible for you to actually lift black hair color out of your hair from your house using home highlighting kits or any color
b-pyyuyz1v4_17-2-rgb_front so that is how to dye black hair
b-pyyuyz1v4_2-2-rgb_front however you do not want to lift it that much
b-pyyuyz1v4_3-2-rgb_front you would have very slight change in the color maybe lift by like a level or two
b-pyyuyz1v4_4-2-rgb_front if you would like to go a lot lighter than where you are with black then i suggest going to a salon in order for them to do it
b-pyyuyz1v4_5-2-rgb_front the professional color can get a little bit higher volume peroxide which will actually help bring your hair up to a higher level plus counteract any brassiness that it may undergo
b-pyyuyz1v4_6-2-rgb_front if you are going to be doing it at your house because you just like a little bit you can either use that home highlighting kit
b-pyyuyz1v4_7-2-rgb_front and you can put a little bit on the brush that they supplied for you
b-pyyuyz1v4_8-2-rgb_front and you are simply going to paint some highlights on a section of hair
b-pyyuyz1v4_9-2-rgb_front when you let go of it you are simply going to release it
b0kaiy9oza8_0-5-rgb_front hi
b0kaiy9oza8_2-5-rgb_front before i paint my ceiling i am going to want to go through and patch up any holes that i see
b0kaiy9oza8_3-5-rgb_front this is going to give my final product a much better look
b0kaiy9oza8_4-5-rgb_front what i am going to do is just take a little bit of mud and put it in that hole and since my ceiling is textured i am going to run my hand over it and try to give it a little bit of texture that will match the texture that is already on the ceiling
b0kaiy9oza8_5-5-rgb_front now even though you could still see this once it is painted it would be virtually impossible to see unless you are really looking for it
b0kaiy9oza8_6-5-rgb_front if you have any nails that are showing in your ceiling first thing you want to do is take the hammer and lightly hit those in
b0kaiy9oza8_7-5-rgb_front just enough to where they sit down into the dry wall just a little bit
b0kaiy9oza8_8-5-rgb_front then we are going to take our mud and mud our nail hole
b0kaiy9oza8_9-5-rgb_front i am going to run my fingers over that again and see if i can give it some of the texture that the ceiling has just by blending that in

b1hxjivcgls_0-8-rgb_front when you come into one pose that stretches particular muscles it is always good to come into a counter pose to stretch the opposing muscles
b1hxjivcgls_1-8-rgb_front so i am going to have gina extend her feet out
b1hxjivcgls_10-8-rgb_front if it is okay for your neck you can let the neck just drop back if not you want to keep it right in line with your spine
b1hxjivcgls_11-8-rgb_front good
b1hxjivcgls_12-8-rgb_front now i am just going to gently press into gina is toes right here so that she gets that stretch through the top of her feet and then taking my feet on either side i am going to use my hands to lift her up and just help her come into that stretch just a little more deeply
b1hxjivcgls_13-8-rgb_front good
b1hxjivcgls_14-8-rgb_front and then we are just going to ask gina to come right back on down again
b1hxjivcgls_15-8-rgb_front good
b1hxjivcgls_2-8-rgb_front she is going to demonstrate this for you with upavistha konasana to an extreme ease pose or a reverse plank pose
b1hxjivcgls_3-8-rgb_front she is seated in dandasana right now with her feet flexed towards her nose sitting up nice and tall
b1hxjivcgls_4-8-rgb_front she is going to inhale and reach her arms up to the sky
b1hxjivcgls_5-8-rgb_front and then she is going to exhale forward into parsvottonasana or a forward bend
b1hxjivcgls_6-8-rgb_front good
b1hxjivcgls_7-8-rgb_front so the counter pose to this gina is going to lengthen up take her hands back press into the hands and open up her chest roll her shoulders back
b1hxjivcgls_8-8-rgb_front good
b1hxjivcgls_9-8-rgb_front then she is going to press through her big toe mounds press big toes into the ground as she lifts her hips up
b1wlbvvtpci_0-5-rgb_front next up is to powder the skin now i know a lot of older women like more mature women do not like to wear powder they feel like it sets in there lines but there is a lot of new powders with finer texture that do not settle into lines
b1wlbvvtpci_1-5-rgb_front it is imperative that you wear powder just to set the foundation it is going to keep in place all day
b1wlbvvtpci_2-5-rgb_front so i like to use a loose powder
b1wlbvvtpci_3-5-rgb_front press powder just for touching up in your purse
b1wlbvvtpci_4-5-rgb_front a loose powder you just want to gently brush it over the skin
b1wlbvvtpci_5-5-rgb_front i just have a little extra powder there and definitely do not be heavy handed with powder
b1wlbvvtpci_6-5-rgb_front just a light sweeping and then remember what i said about putting the powder on top of the concealer you definitely want to take a sponge and you are actually going to press it on
b1wlbvvtpci_7-5-rgb_front if you just dust it on with a brush it does not work as effectively but when you use a sponge it actually will help keep that oil in place
b1wlbvvtpci_8-5-rgb_front so as you can see perfectly powder and still looking like herself
b1wlbvvtpci_9-5-rgb_front her gorgeous self

b2k59617mjs_0_1-5-rgb_front hi my name is otis st clair and i am here today to talk to you about passing route plays now every team or every organization has a passing route tree so i am going to show you the passing route tree and probably show you a couple of routes that you can run with your offense
b2k59617mjs_10-5-rgb_front my name is otis and that is our passing route plays
b2k59617mjs_2-5-rgb_front the passing route tree starts with the wide receiver and goes up like this which would be called the fly route and then off of that we have our branches
b2k59617mjs_3-5-rgb_front the first branch we will draw is a quick out and that runs about to yards and then we have a slant route which is also running about to maybe six yards going up from there and staying on to the outside we have a deep out we have what is called a flat route which is running to the flag part of the in zone and then coming off of that and going back to the inside we have a curl which used to be called a butt hook and we would have a post route and then we have what is called an in or square in
b2k59617mjs_4-5-rgb_front these routes also numbered as well
b2k59617mjs_5-5-rgb_front this one is called a one route for the quick out two for the slant three for the deep out four for the in and five for the flat and six for the curl and we have a post corner that i forgot which is the seven route eight is for the post route and the nine is the flat route
b2k59617mjs_6-5-rgb_front so that is the passing tree
b2k59617mjs_7-5-rgb_front our even numbers are to the inside with the football being right here so if you call an even number the passing tree the passing routes are going to the inside so if you call an out route with an odd number you are going to the outside or towards the sidelines
b2k59617mjs_8-5-rgb_front that is your basic simple passing route tree
b2k59617mjs_9-5-rgb_front you can make your play book from this tree right here run your routes and score touch downs
b32g5nvg9qc_1-8-rgb_front just exactly is a rain stick
b32g5nvg9qc_10-8-rgb_front i know that native americans in the south west of arizona make rain sticks and fill them with the seeds of the cactus
b32g5nvg9qc_11-8-rgb_front we are going to make rain sticks too and if we are not fortunate enough to have a piece of cactus laying around there are other things we can use
b32g5nvg9qc_12-8-rgb_front so will not you join me make a rain stick
b32g5nvg9qc_2-8-rgb_front who makes rain sticks
b32g5nvg9qc_3-8-rgb_front and how are they made
b32g5nvg9qc_4-8-rgb_front well this is a rain stick and rain sticks are made by people in africa they were made by the aztecs they are made by native american and this particular rain stick was made by the deaquitrix tribe people who live in chile just below the andes mountains
b32g5nvg9qc_5_6-8-rgb_front how are real rains sticks made people take a cactus that has died and has fallen down and while it is still soft or just beginning to dry out they will cut it into sticks the lengths they want then as you can see here the thorns of the cactus are pulled off and turned around and pushed back into the cactus all along the cactus in holes that are naturally
b32g5nvg9qc_7-8-rgb_front these spiral down or go up and down depending on the type of cactus
b32g5nvg9qc_8-8-rgb_front then the cactus is put in the sun to dry and a piece of the cactus is put in the bottom to seal it
b32g5nvg9qc_9-8-rgb_front then the cactus is filled with something natural this particular rain stick is filled with little pebbles
b33htmhptl8_1-5-rgb_front now we are going to discuss swamps
b33htmhptl8_2-5-rgb_front swamps are these little tiles that are greenish in color and hexagonal and they also are half sized pieces much like your water and they are a water source which means you cannot put molten lava on them
b33htmhptl8_3-5-rgb_front these actually come from the second master set swarm of the marro which is going to be swamp heavy
b33htmhptl8_4-5-rgb_front and once again as you see they have the little grooves in them so they can slide easily in to each other and into land pieces
b33htmhptl8_5-5-rgb_front and the difference between swamp water and regular water is that syvarris who has a move of five when he moves over to water he moved spaces and he has a move of five
b33htmhptl8_6-5-rgb_front however since he entered in water he has to stop because that is the rule with water
b33htmhptl8_7-5-rgb_front now on the other hand he move and be in swamp water and he continue can continue moving out his turn
b33htmhptl8_8-5-rgb_front swamp water does not have the stipulation that he has to stop so he can continue moving on
b33htmhptl8_9-5-rgb_front now swamp water also will give a lot of other creatures benefits and this is why they put swamp water into the second master set also to give another game variant for heroscape the game and the expansions that have come before it
b3oisnnqnfm_1-8-rgb_front we are going to talk a little bit about security and some of the things you can do to make it a little tougher for a thief to get in your house
b3oisnnqnfm_10-8-rgb_front what you need to do is just step your foot on the bottom of the door push that latch closed and if you are going to be gone for long periods of time like you are going on vacatoin most latches have a hole and you can actually put a padlock through it too
b3oisnnqnfm_11-8-rgb_front here is an example of a door that is nearly perfectly set up
b3oisnnqnfm_12-8-rgb_front you have got a door handle with a key you have got a deadbolt and the door frame itself is actually recessed in so that you can not get a credit card in behind here
b3oisnnqnfm_13-8-rgb_front a couple of things that i did notice about this door
b3oisnnqnfm_14-8-rgb_front one this lock set up properly installed properly but the deadbolt you will see is actually upside down
b3oisnnqnfm_15-8-rgb_front this causes a problem with the springs
b3oisnnqnfm_16-8-rgb_front eventually taht will cause a weakness in the springs and the lock will fail because it is hanging upside down and you do not have gravity in your favor
b3oisnnqnfm_17-8-rgb_front another security issue that i see with this door is this window
b3oisnnqnfm_18-8-rgb_front this is a really quick easy way for a thief to get in and actually a thief loves to see these because he walks up throws a rock through this window and reaches in and unlocks the door and away you go
b3oisnnqnfm_2-8-rgb_front in this case this is the door that leads from the garage to the house
b3oisnnqnfm_3-8-rgb_front you will see there is no deadbolt
b3oisnnqnfm_4-8-rgb_front the nice thing is that the door frame is built properly
b3oisnnqnfm_5-8-rgb_front the drawback is as with any lock if you do not lock it it does not do you much good
b3oisnnqnfm_6-8-rgb_front that is one of the things i can stress the most
b3oisnnqnfm_7-8-rgb_front when i come to a house that somebody has locked their keys in the house i can almost find a window that is a cracked a door that is open or some way of entry without even picking a lock
b3oisnnqnfm_8-8-rgb_front one of the common things i find in houses when i come to unlock them is the garage
b3oisnnqnfm_9-8-rgb_front this garage door has an opener and it will hold the door to a certain extent but if you do not use this latch or do not have one of these latches nothing else is going to help and this is just a quick easy way for someone to get in
b4wymwxvp5a_0-5-rgb_front now i want to talk a little bit more about eye contact and i am going to give you a tip for making eye contact with the entire audience
b4wymwxvp5a_1-5-rgb_front sometimes it can be a little overwhelming to look at everyone in the audience
b4wymwxvp5a_10-5-rgb_front they will be giving you visual feed back so that you can adjust something if you need to
b4wymwxvp5a_11-5-rgb_front maybe you need to you know if people are looking like they do not know what you are talking about perhaps you need to slow down
b4wymwxvp5a_12-5-rgb_front whatever it is it can give you cues and clues to how you re doing as you are giving your speech
b4wymwxvp5a_2-5-rgb_front you might think of doing it this way
b4wymwxvp5a_3-5-rgb_front you might think of creating a pattern meaning i am going to look at that group then that group then that group then this group then center
b4wymwxvp5a_4-5-rgb_front or maybe you make a z formation
b4wymwxvp5a_5-5-rgb_front maybe you look right center left center right something
b4wymwxvp5a_6-5-rgb_front but create a pattern so that one you do not get stuck somewhere and two it is more of a mechanical thing in the sense of all the groups are the same
b4wymwxvp5a_7-5-rgb_front this is group a this is group b this is group c i am going to make sure to cover a b c c b a
b4wymwxvp5a_8-5-rgb_front however it is come up with a pattern
b4wymwxvp5a_9-5-rgb_front and the reason why this is so important is because by looking at the entire audience you will be able to see how they are responding to you as a speaker
b4bk9wtpz4a_0-5-rgb_front if you are considering buying an african grey parrot or really almost any parrot the first thing you should do is read
b4bk9wtpz4a_1-5-rgb_front get some books read about the bird
b4bk9wtpz4a_10-5-rgb_front what it likes to eat what it likes to do
b4bk9wtpz4a_11-5-rgb_front what kind of toys does it like to play with so that i can make the bird more comfortable
b4bk9wtpz4a_12-5-rgb_front and this is true with any bird especially if you are looking at a macaw or something do not live in an apartment
b4bk9wtpz4a_13-5-rgb_front some birds scream
b4bk9wtpz4a_14-5-rgb_front african greys growl
b4bk9wtpz4a_15-5-rgb_front they are are different ways that these birds want to show that they want some attention
b4bk9wtpz4a_16-5-rgb_front and if you live in an apartment you might make some neighbors very angry if you are getting the wrong bird
b4bk9wtpz4a_17-5-rgb_front african greys are normally very quiet so they are good pets for living in a tight area
b4bk9wtpz4a_18-5-rgb_front but know your bird
b4bk9wtpz4a_19-5-rgb_front know where the bird come from
b4bk9wtpz4a_2-5-rgb_front find out if the bird matches your personality matches your living conditions and so forth
b4bk9wtpz4a_20-5-rgb_front know something about the bird is personalities about what to expect from that type of bird
b4bk9wtpz4a_21-5-rgb_front there are plenty of books out there that you can read on african greys really on any kind of parrot or bird and this should be done first
b4bk9wtpz4a_22-5-rgb_front and then also make sure that you have got proper housing for that bird
b4bk9wtpz4a_23-5-rgb_front the housing can never be too large but it can be too small
b4bk9wtpz4a_24-5-rgb_front if you have got the bird in a cage that is too small you are going to have an unhappy bird
b4bk9wtpz4a_25-5-rgb_front greys like to move around they like to play with toys
b4bk9wtpz4a_26-5-rgb_front they like to do antics where they can turn upside down and flip
b4bk9wtpz4a_27-5-rgb_front and they need the space to be able to do that
b4bk9wtpz4a_28-5-rgb_front so check out what your bird needs
b4bk9wtpz4a_29-5-rgb_front check out what the requirements of the bird is and a little bit about the bird before you decide to go and buy one
b4bk9wtpz4a_3-5-rgb_front then do some research
b4bk9wtpz4a_4-5-rgb_front i suggest that you buy parrots from breeders
b4bk9wtpz4a_5-5-rgb_front breeders know the history of the bird
b4bk9wtpz4a_6-5-rgb_front they know the what the bird is able to do the age of the bird
b4bk9wtpz4a_7-5-rgb_front a lot of times at pet stores they just have the bird
b4bk9wtpz4a_8-5-rgb_front they have no information and so you are kind of left out in the lurch
b4bk9wtpz4a_9-5-rgb_front i like to go to the person i get my birds from talk to them about what my bird likes
b6zncj7ikxq_0-8-rgb_front now a lot of technique goes into ring throws and it is very different from throwing a ball or a club
b6zncj7ikxq_1-8-rgb_front first suggestion for learning how to juggle rings is find a place indoors with a high enough ceiling to practice
b6zncj7ikxq_10-8-rgb_front this can help guide the path especially for higher throws
b6zncj7ikxq_11-8-rgb_front as you see just angling the ring a little bit automatically drove the ring rather out to the side
b6zncj7ikxq_12-8-rgb_front same goes for this side
b6zncj7ikxq_13-8-rgb_front that is your basic ring throw
b6zncj7ikxq_14-8-rgb_front once you get that down the steps are the same as juggling with any prop
b6zncj7ikxq_15-8-rgb_front start with one add two and then work your way up to three
b6zncj7ikxq_2-8-rgb_front doing it outside can be great but rings are usually light enough that the slightest gust of wind will take them off course
b6zncj7ikxq_3-8-rgb_front the object of your basic ring throw is to be able to see both sides of the ring as it travels past you
b6zncj7ikxq_4-8-rgb_front when it is in one hand you can see the inside
b6zncj7ikxq_5-8-rgb_front as it travels through the other side you see the inside over here
b6zncj7ikxq_6-8-rgb_front meaning you do not want the ring skew outward like this
b6zncj7ikxq_7-8-rgb_front the second your ring is skewed inward like this you have obstructed the path of other rings
b6zncj7ikxq_8-8-rgb_front the other thing to remember is that you can cheat a little bit with angling of your wrist
b6zncj7ikxq_9-8-rgb_front while you never want the ring to be changed on this plane you can have it changed on this plane
b9nwwzf0c5e_0-5-rgb_front in this first section we are going to be talking about front kick
b9nwwzf0c5e_1-5-rgb_front your front kick is going to be your most basic kick it is going to look like this
b9nwwzf0c5e_10-5-rgb_front so let is break it down so one pick up your foot two make sure you good front position kick keya and three
b9nwwzf0c5e_11-5-rgb_front ok now as you get better and better at it start kicking higher and higher
b9nwwzf0c5e_12-5-rgb_front so one more time one two keya three
b9nwwzf0c5e_13-5-rgb_front so here in guards up look where you are kicking one now let is kick a little higher two keya three
b9nwwzf0c5e_14-5-rgb_front ok now what i do not want to see when you kick i do not want you to bend your knee so you dip down which a lot of people do
b9nwwzf0c5e_15-5-rgb_front from your head all the way down to the foot your standing on everything should stay completely straight and upright
b9nwwzf0c5e_16-5-rgb_front you do not want to bend or a lot of people when they kick they go on their your your toes on this foot you are standing on
b9nwwzf0c5e_17-5-rgb_front keep everything planted on the floor
b9nwwzf0c5e_18-5-rgb_front the only thing that moves should be your leg
b9nwwzf0c5e_19-5-rgb_front from here kick and down
b9nwwzf0c5e_2-5-rgb_front you put your guards up pick you leg up kick and back down
b9nwwzf0c5e_20-5-rgb_front so one more time one two three
b9nwwzf0c5e_21-5-rgb_front good job
b9nwwzf0c5e_22-5-rgb_front and that is your front leg front kick
b9nwwzf0c5e_3-5-rgb_front that is going to be your front kick it is a very basic kick
b9nwwzf0c5e_4-5-rgb_front let is go ahead and break that down in three sections
b9nwwzf0c5e_5-5-rgb_front first of all let is talk about the part of the foot we kick with
b9nwwzf0c5e_6-5-rgb_front ok now the part of the foot we kick with is the ball of your foot
b9nwwzf0c5e_7-5-rgb_front ok the ball of your foot is going to be right here right underneath your toes that is going to be the ball of your foot
b9nwwzf0c5e_8-5-rgb_front so take your foot put it on the floor like this kind of like you are wearing high heels and stomp on the floor you see how strong that is keep it nice and tight
b9nwwzf0c5e_9-5-rgb_front now from this position pick up your foot and this is going to be your chamber for your front kick
ba53fmwdnpu_1-8-rgb_front now with the decoy route again
ba53fmwdnpu_10-8-rgb_front set go
ba53fmwdnpu_11-8-rgb_front there you go
ba53fmwdnpu_12-8-rgb_front it forces him to make a decision meanwhile the ball may be going someplace else
ba53fmwdnpu_13-8-rgb_front but what he is done is he is locked in his defender is attention and caused him to not be able to read and react to anything else going on in the field
ba53fmwdnpu_14-8-rgb_front he has to respect that this man can possibly get the ball and get down the field
ba53fmwdnpu_2-8-rgb_front this opens up so many other things so what the receiver has to do is he is gotta make we have gone over this his initial steps look like he is getting the ball every time
ba53fmwdnpu_3-8-rgb_front it is not just a matter of which route he is running but just the fact that he is even running a route
ba53fmwdnpu_4-8-rgb_front so chris we are going to explode out into the five yard stop
ba53fmwdnpu_5-8-rgb_front and he is gotta force brian to still make that decision and to back off of him he does not want him to get too close
ba53fmwdnpu_6-8-rgb_front this is where he can sit and open up
ba53fmwdnpu_7-8-rgb_front now that opens up many things for any other plays or players on the field
ba53fmwdnpu_8-8-rgb_front this might be a running play but he is got to run his route essentially just like the play before when he did get the ball
ba53fmwdnpu_9-8-rgb_front so this time let is fire it out in full speed
balpzer8flu_0-8-rgb_front hi this is liz muller from liz is hair design in hollywood florida
balpzer8flu_1-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about how to grow hair long
balpzer8flu_10-8-rgb_front i did not want to pull the weak hair that is already been you know hurt and damaged from all the stuff she did
balpzer8flu_11-8-rgb_front so basically setting the hair treating it well taking care of it telling them to use certain products at home like the moroccan oil which is wonderful or maybe you want them to use a semi di lino oil
balpzer8flu_12-8-rgb_front that is also very good for the hair
balpzer8flu_13-8-rgb_front thank you
balpzer8flu_14-8-rgb_front this is liz speaking
balpzer8flu_2-8-rgb_front we have a really beautiful model here
balpzer8flu_3-8-rgb_front this young lady actually was a marine and her hair was in extensions for quite a long time
balpzer8flu_4-8-rgb_front what i did basically is when she came to me her hair was very thin in the top because of the extensions and she had weak hair
balpzer8flu_5-8-rgb_front her hair is fine and she is got a relaxer in there but she could not relax her hair for a while so she basically needed a lot of treatments
balpzer8flu_6-8-rgb_front what i did for her is we constantly treated this hair once a week and we put mask protein and moisture mask in this head of hair to treat it
balpzer8flu_7-8-rgb_front i also set the hair
balpzer8flu_8-8-rgb_front i believe in setting the hair because it just makes it strong makes it really nice
balpzer8flu_9-8-rgb_front i do not believe in blowing it out
bana79gwzxi_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is dave andrews and today i am going to tell you what hardware means in computer terms
bana79gwzxi_1-5-rgb_front when we are referring to computer hardware we are talking about the devices that make up the computers that we use
bana79gwzxi_10-5-rgb_front each of these are components of this computer
bana79gwzxi_11-5-rgb_front now i am not going to open up my laptop but inside of here we are going to have a hard drive
bana79gwzxi_12-5-rgb_front now that is a device that stores files on your computer basically it is a magnetic little cylinder that will spin around and has read heads that will store and save and retrieve data
bana79gwzxi_13-5-rgb_front there is also going to be memory that is inside of your laptop
bana79gwzxi_14-5-rgb_front that is going to be a piece of computer hardware
bana79gwzxi_15-5-rgb_front that is what your computer uses while it is running not necessarily to store long term data but just data that is operating on at that time
bana79gwzxi_16-5-rgb_front you know in the case of a laptop there is going to be a battery that is computer hardware
bana79gwzxi_17-5-rgb_front and underneath this little case right here it is what is called a motherboard
bana79gwzxi_18-5-rgb_front and that is going to include your processor your video card your sound card and those other pieces of computer hardware that make up the computer
bana79gwzxi_19-5-rgb_front my name is dave andrews and i have just explained to you what hardware means in computer terms
bana79gwzxi_2-5-rgb_front this is going to be your monitor your mouse your keyboard that is all computer hardware
bana79gwzxi_3-5-rgb_front now i am going to use my laptop as an example
bana79gwzxi_4-5-rgb_front there are several things within this laptop that would qualify as a computer hardware
bana79gwzxi_5-5-rgb_front the laptop itself would be a piece of hardware but also would be each individual component that makes up this laptop
bana79gwzxi_6-5-rgb_front for instance this screen here
bana79gwzxi_7-5-rgb_front that is going to be a piece of computer hardware
bana79gwzxi_8-5-rgb_front the keyboard that is built into the base of the laptop is going to be computer hardware this mouse pad that is on the front is computer hardware
bana79gwzxi_9-5-rgb_front the cd drive here is going to be hardware as well
bcpx9dkhbgc_0-5-rgb_front hi
bcpx9dkhbgc_10-5-rgb_front if it is not far enough tighten it up and screw it in some more
bcpx9dkhbgc_2-5-rgb_front in this video clip i will be talking about using a drywall screw gun
bcpx9dkhbgc_3-5-rgb_front when we are screwing in drywall we want to make sure that the screw just leaves a dimple in the paper for the drywall
bcpx9dkhbgc_4-5-rgb_front we want the screw to go all the way through
bcpx9dkhbgc_5-5-rgb_front if you are using a regular drill some times it can take a little while to get the hang of it
bcpx9dkhbgc_6-5-rgb_front the way that you set this drywall screw gun is you turn this collar on the end of the drill
bcpx9dkhbgc_7-5-rgb_front and if you take a look at the picture here if you turn it to the left it is going to leave the screw out further
bcpx9dkhbgc_8-5-rgb_front if you turn it to the right it is going to sink it in a little bit further
bcpx9dkhbgc_9-5-rgb_front so you are going to have to use a few test screws screw it in
beay71hzc9m_0-1-rgb_front hi my name is cindy mastry with yoga etc
beay71hzc9m_10-1-rgb_front beautiful
beay71hzc9m_11-1-rgb_front in this pose you are surrendering your head to your heart so you allow yourself to lead with your heart
beay71hzc9m_12-1-rgb_front beautiful faith
beay71hzc9m_13-1-rgb_front that is the split bow thanks so much
beay71hzc9m_2-1-rgb_front faith is going to help me show the split bow in this clip
beay71hzc9m_3-1-rgb_front so faith is going to inhale in and reach her arms up standing in mountain pose
beay71hzc9m_4-1-rgb_front good she is going to extend her left foot forward ground through her left thigh and root down through her left foot
beay71hzc9m_5-1-rgb_front she is going to engage her core and lift her right leg back and bring her arms all the way down to the floor and extend her leg up to the sky
beay71hzc9m_6-1-rgb_front so she wants to feel a long line of energy from the crown of her head all the way up to the tip of her toe
beay71hzc9m_7-1-rgb_front to split the bow she is going to bend her knee and reach back with her opposite hand reach onto her toe and then lengthen though her thigh open through her chest and pull her knee upward
beay71hzc9m_8-1-rgb_front yes good job faith
beay71hzc9m_9-1-rgb_front now if you want to take this a little bit further you could also take your hand off the ground and wrap it around your calve and stand in balance
bfwnb7lyeh8_0-8-rgb_front and now we continue with the l shape traveling walk with the stretch on the ends
bfwnb7lyeh8_1-8-rgb_front so let is start out on the right foot
bfwnb7lyeh8_10-8-rgb_front so imagine like moving from the inside out like a star
bfwnb7lyeh8_11-8-rgb_front you are the star from the inside out
bfwnb7lyeh8_12-8-rgb_front letting the movement radiate from the center from your core as you stretch out reach out
bfwnb7lyeh8_13-8-rgb_front enjoy the stretch
bfwnb7lyeh8_14-8-rgb_front traveling step l shape stretch
bfwnb7lyeh8_2-8-rgb_front we take three steps forward and then we pause on that right foot and left foot goes up and we stretch
bfwnb7lyeh8_3-8-rgb_front we walk back balancing on the left foot we stretch
bfwnb7lyeh8_4-8-rgb_front we walk to the right step touch step and we stretch
bfwnb7lyeh8_5-8-rgb_front we walk to the left and we stretch
bfwnb7lyeh8_6-8-rgb_front and then we walk back forward and we stretch
bfwnb7lyeh8_7-8-rgb_front and then that stretch freely lets your body yawn and open
bfwnb7lyeh8_8-8-rgb_front walk step touch step stretch
bfwnb7lyeh8_9-8-rgb_front step touch step open
bfaffad7ucs_0-8-rgb_front i am going to show you how to use the janowak head harness
bfaffad7ucs_1-8-rgb_front what it is designed for is to help pulling dogs
bfaffad7ucs_10-8-rgb_front any kind of fussing or fidgeting get your treats out coax him with you
bfaffad7ucs_11-8-rgb_front good boy
bfaffad7ucs_12-8-rgb_front turn him around lots of treats
bfaffad7ucs_13-8-rgb_front get a good walk going
bfaffad7ucs_14-8-rgb_front i can bring him around i can bring him next to me and i can reward him for staying by my side
bfaffad7ucs_15-8-rgb_front it keeps him nice and calm as long as he is not fussing around
bfaffad7ucs_2-8-rgb_front with a dog on a regular flat collar or a martingale which this is when he gets ahead of you i got give him a pull back i got to use a little bit more strength
bfaffad7ucs_3-8-rgb_front if i get walking with him and he wants to get a head of me i got to pull him a little bit more
bfaffad7ucs_4-8-rgb_front he is not pulling real bad now
bfaffad7ucs_5-8-rgb_front we get going with something come on come on
bfaffad7ucs_6-8-rgb_front i have to encourage him a little bit more
bfaffad7ucs_7-8-rgb_front with the head harness once you hook it up i can guide him around a little bit easier
bfaffad7ucs_8-8-rgb_front you want to remember to never yank never pull never leash pop
bfaffad7ucs_9-8-rgb_front always use a slow fluid movement
bfto1fuohec_0-5-rgb_front hey this is tracy goodwin and i am the red sweater lady
bfto1fuohec_1-5-rgb_front and i am here to talk to you about having a very successful job interview
bfto1fuohec_10-5-rgb_front you made it this far

bfto1fuohec_12-5-rgb_front now we really want to do a bang up job at the interview so that you can get that job offer that you want
bfto1fuohec_2-5-rgb_front and i am talking about the actual interview itself
bfto1fuohec_3-5-rgb_front now i do not know if you knew this or not but there are three phases in an actual interview
bfto1fuohec_4-5-rgb_front you have what is called the the question and answer stage and the closing
bfto1fuohec_5-5-rgb_front and we are going to talk about all of those and what is important to each and every phase
bfto1fuohec_6-5-rgb_front also going to take a look at what happens after the interview
bfto1fuohec_7-5-rgb_front what happens during the interview with regards to information that you want to find out and information the employer is going to find out from you
bfto1fuohec_8-5-rgb_front lots of important tips and strategies for make the absolute best impression that you can at the interview
bfto1fuohec_9-5-rgb_front which is very important in such a competitive job market that we live with today
bh1kct78l7c_0-8-rgb_front hi this is jon and in this clip we will be applying the first coat of finish
bh1kct78l7c_1-8-rgb_front for my finish i have chosen a clear wood finish
bh1kct78l7c_2-8-rgb_front it is just a kind of a plain jane clear wood finish and it is going to seal my wood and really protect it
bh1kct78l7c_3-8-rgb_front now you will notice i did put gloves on and this is going to just protect my hands from the finish and i am going to be putting the finish on with a real small paintbrush
bh1kct78l7c_4-8-rgb_front i will just get a little finish on and paint it right on
bh1kct78l7c_5-8-rgb_front the key is just to make even brush strokes and you want to completely cover your workpiece
bh1kct78l7c_6-8-rgb_front the first coat of finish will be just a little bit thicker than the second coats and that is primarily just because the wood grain is going to soak it all up and the finish is going to seal that wood grain
bh1kct78l7c_7-8-rgb_front make sure you are getting both sides of your project and you also want to get all of the edges really good
bh1kct78l7c_8-8-rgb_front after i finish putting my first coat on i just take my paintbrush and go over it one more time just to remove any excess finish or any runs that may have occurred and i am going to let that sit for hours while it dries
bhew7t7tjsc_0-5-rgb_front the next project we are going to show you for mother is day is some that you can use with little glass vases
bhew7t7tjsc_1-5-rgb_front are really hot right now and here is one that i have done
bhew7t7tjsc_10-5-rgb_front and here is a nice little mug with some
bhew7t7tjsc_11-5-rgb_front so let is get started
bhew7t7tjsc_12-5-rgb_front the first thing i am going to do is choose what i want to rub on
bhew7t7tjsc_13-5-rgb_front so i am going to go ahead and use this chocolate chip and there is this really pretty butterfly so
bhew7t7tjsc_14-5-rgb_front because it is in a little bit i am going to go ahead and cut it out
bhew7t7tjsc_15-5-rgb_front if it was closer to the edge i could just lift up the paper and slide it in
bhew7t7tjsc_16-5-rgb_front and then you just want to make sure that your glass is clean and dry
bhew7t7tjsc_17-5-rgb_front and i have already done that
bhew7t7tjsc_18-5-rgb_front so i have taken my butterfly and i am just going to press it here
bhew7t7tjsc_19-5-rgb_front a couple things you can do here
bhew7t7tjsc_2-5-rgb_front this is called an old olive color and i have just rubbed it onto this cute little vase
bhew7t7tjsc_20-5-rgb_front i just use kind of the heat from my hand and kind of push it down
bhew7t7tjsc_21-5-rgb_front you could also put a piece of tape there to hold it
bhew7t7tjsc_22-5-rgb_front the pack of the come with this little popsicle stick
bhew7t7tjsc_23-5-rgb_front you can use that to rub you could use your bone folder to rub
bhew7t7tjsc_24-5-rgb_front i like to use my stylus
bhew7t7tjsc_25-5-rgb_front so now that i have it in place
bhew7t7tjsc_26-5-rgb_front and i am just going to turn it and hold it down flat and i am just going to go ahead and rub
bhew7t7tjsc_27-5-rgb_front and you are just going to rub and you will see as you are rubbing that the color on your what you are embossing is going to lighten as it is applied to the glass
bhew7t7tjsc_28-5-rgb_front so you just keep rubbing and rubbing until you see it lifting
bhew7t7tjsc_29-5-rgb_front and then you can go ahead and push with your thumb and you can see i will need a little bit more there
bhew7t7tjsc_3-5-rgb_front here is some other things you can do
bhew7t7tjsc_30-5-rgb_front and then just go ahead and gradually lift it off
bhew7t7tjsc_31-5-rgb_front if it is not ready to come just give it another rub
bhew7t7tjsc_32-5-rgb_front sometimes it takes a little time but just be patient
bhew7t7tjsc_33-5-rgb_front and then when you lift it off at the end you will have a beautiful butterfly to your glass vase
bhew7t7tjsc_34-5-rgb_front and when you come back i will show you what else you can do with these
bhew7t7tjsc_4-5-rgb_front this is a votive holder
bhew7t7tjsc_5-5-rgb_front this one also has
bhew7t7tjsc_6-5-rgb_front here is a little jar this one also has
bhew7t7tjsc_7-5-rgb_front i have just tied it with a ribbon
bhew7t7tjsc_8-5-rgb_front this would be really cute with some cotton balls in it if you used it in the bathroom
bhew7t7tjsc_9-5-rgb_front any small little thing that you want to put
bifsc66t0u4_0-8-rgb_front if standards and six seem like a little much and a bit complicated way to teach geography to you then there is a much simpler way to think about it that will also set your feet on the right path
bifsc66t0u4_1-8-rgb_front in its most basic form geography is about places people and cultures
bifsc66t0u4_10-8-rgb_front as we said earlier we believe that geography should be an every day subject and not something that turns up once in a while in a child is education
bifsc66t0u4_11-8-rgb_front the reason for this is that geography relates in some way to what is going on in our children is formal educations every day
bifsc66t0u4_12-8-rgb_front all that is necessary for us to incorporate geography on a daily basis as parents is to begin to be aware of what geography is in the study of places people and cultures and to begin to look for ways that it shows up in every day life and then work that into what we are already teaching
bifsc66t0u4_13-8-rgb_front in this way our children not only grow in geographical literacy they also make real connections with why geography is important to their every day life in the future as well as right now
bifsc66t0u4_14-8-rgb_front we agree with charlotte mason that the essence of education is forming personal relationships with the great ideas of all time
bifsc66t0u4_15-8-rgb_front we encourage children to form relationships with the people the places and the cultures that are around them as well as those that are in the larger world
bifsc66t0u4_16-8-rgb_front in this way they build cultural literacy a little bit at a time and they become comfortable living in the great big world
bifsc66t0u4_17-8-rgb_front in the next three segments we are going to go stage by stage and help you to see what kinds of things you can do to encourage geographical literacy in the early elementary years in the middle elementary years and then again in high school
bifsc66t0u4_2-8-rgb_front that is it so if you focus on thinking about geography as the study of places people and cultures you will quickly be able to find ways to integrate it into all areas of your curriculum
bifsc66t0u4_3-8-rgb_front the study of places includes map skills geology terrain maps and political maps learning the rivers and mountain ranges states capitals and much much more
bifsc66t0u4_4-8-rgb_front the study of people would include current events race and ethnicity population migration and density historical persons such as monarchs scientists or adventurers events wars and crusades native populations
bifsc66t0u4_5-8-rgb_front then there are current adventures that are going on such as world cup races or following the life of the oldest man to swim the english channel
bifsc66t0u4_6-8-rgb_front in studying culture there is some overlap in what we study with people because cultures are made up of collections of peoples
bifsc66t0u4_7-8-rgb_front one of the things that can be studied is cultural development as a result of geographical surroundings such as people who live in deserts on islands
bifsc66t0u4_8-8-rgb_front when you are studying culture you are also going to look at other things like art music religion and daily living
bifsc66t0u4_9-8-rgb_front so you can see in thinking geography just in the simple terms of places people and culture that if you brainstorm on those three topics alone you can very quickly come up with a lot of ways to integrate geography into every aspect of your curriculum
bjqw6jzsuaa_0-8-rgb_front the topic today is how to interpret tire ratings
bjqw6jzsuaa_1-8-rgb_front this tire is a two o five sixty slash sixteen
bjqw6jzsuaa_10-8-rgb_front which means it was made in a thirty eighth week of
bjqw6jzsuaa_11-8-rgb_front sometimes when you buy tires you will find that they have been sitting on a shelf for a while
bjqw6jzsuaa_12-8-rgb_front always check that rating first
bjqw6jzsuaa_13-8-rgb_front tires should not be put in your car if they are more then five years old
bjqw6jzsuaa_14-8-rgb_front this will help you not to have a blowout or something
bjqw6jzsuaa_15-8-rgb_front tires although tires are brand new on the shelf that does not mean that they have not disintegrated
bjqw6jzsuaa_16-8-rgb_front the rubber deteriorates everything deteriorates in a tire from the day they are manufactured
bjqw6jzsuaa_17-8-rgb_front so always check your temperatures make sure you get the proper car tire for your car this will determine how good your tire is
bjqw6jzsuaa_18-8-rgb_front and if it is the right tire and the right proper tire for your car
bjqw6jzsuaa_2-8-rgb_front and there is an r there
bjqw6jzsuaa_3-8-rgb_front the r means radial
bjqw6jzsuaa_4-8-rgb_front other tires were bias
bjqw6jzsuaa_5-8-rgb_front there is a number here which is the temperature rating four hundred
bjqw6jzsuaa_6-8-rgb_front there is a traction rating of aa and there is a temperature rating of a
bjqw6jzsuaa_7-8-rgb_front these numbers determine how long the tire will last and what type of speed they will take and how hard a tire they are
bjqw6jzsuaa_8-8-rgb_front there is also a number down here which tells you the date the tire was made
bjqw6jzsuaa_9-8-rgb_front this one i think was thirty eight o six
bl2lb4xeqdq_1-9-rgb_front i am jason shoemaker at slugfest printmaking workshop and i am going to show you how to wipe a plate in intaglio printmaking
bl2lb4xeqdq_10-9-rgb_front so you can scrub in the ink
bl2lb4xeqdq_11-9-rgb_front that helps even it out a little bit
bl2lb4xeqdq_12-9-rgb_front i generally like to just get in to wiping
bl2lb4xeqdq_13-9-rgb_front the idea is that it is in the wrist and keep moving in a sweeping pattern
bl2lb4xeqdq_14-9-rgb_front always starting off the plate and ending off the plate
bl2lb4xeqdq_15-9-rgb_front so it is just a motion like this
bl2lb4xeqdq_16-9-rgb_front and you keep turning the plate as you need to
bl2lb4xeqdq_17-9-rgb_front now we are using a pretty already saturated tarleton
bl2lb4xeqdq_18-9-rgb_front you can see ink is getting on there
bl2lb4xeqdq_19-9-rgb_front so what you want to do is just move around to a cleaner part
bl2lb4xeqdq_2-9-rgb_front we have our tarleton
bl2lb4xeqdq_20-9-rgb_front now we are going to pull off a little more ink
bl2lb4xeqdq_21-9-rgb_front and this first waves is going to get some of the excess ink off
bl2lb4xeqdq_22-9-rgb_front get the ink down in the crevices move it around
bl2lb4xeqdq_23-9-rgb_front you already start to see the image coming through there
bl2lb4xeqdq_24-9-rgb_front now we have gotten to about that point we want to switch to a less saturated tarleton
bl2lb4xeqdq_25-9-rgb_front we slowly get cleaner and cleaner with the tarletons
bl2lb4xeqdq_26-9-rgb_front this one is ready to go
bl2lb4xeqdq_27-9-rgb_front and you can see it is pulling off more ink and we are getting more of the image showing through there
bl2lb4xeqdq_28-9-rgb_front and again just keep turning around and make sure you are starting off the plate and ending off the plate
bl2lb4xeqdq_29-9-rgb_front if you stop on the plate you actually will leave ink on there
bl2lb4xeqdq_3-9-rgb_front it is been balled up
bl2lb4xeqdq_30-9-rgb_front and you actually see some of the pattern of the tarleton
bl2lb4xeqdq_31-9-rgb_front now we go even cleaner
bl2lb4xeqdq_32-9-rgb_front this one is not brand new but it is clean enough to do what we need it do
bl2lb4xeqdq_33-9-rgb_front and if you need to concentrate in certain areas you want to kind of pick up the tarleton
bl2lb4xeqdq_34-9-rgb_front you can hit it with your hand if you want
bl2lb4xeqdq_35-9-rgb_front but just keep it moving
bl2lb4xeqdq_4-9-rgb_front good in the hand
bl2lb4xeqdq_5-9-rgb_front we have our hot plate which is slightly warm just to keep the plate hot so that you can move around
bl2lb4xeqdq_6-9-rgb_front we have got our plate and it is inked up
bl2lb4xeqdq_7-9-rgb_front now there is a few different techniques wiping the plate
bl2lb4xeqdq_8-9-rgb_front it is going to be different for every plate that you do
bl2lb4xeqdq_9-9-rgb_front you just need to print and kind of see what the plate is doing and then keep going
blr_bcyb0ui_0-5-rgb_front i am dr joe neely
blr_bcyb0ui_1-5-rgb_front i practice with the barton oaks dental group
blr_bcyb0ui_10-5-rgb_front when a tooth is sensitive to pressure then it typically will mean that you either have a fracture something moving inside the tooth or up against the gum or an infection contained in the structure around the tooth be it gum or bone but it is trapped in between two structures and the pressure from that infection causes pain
blr_bcyb0ui_2-5-rgb_front we are going to talk about the symptoms of a toothache
blr_bcyb0ui_3-5-rgb_front obviously the main symptom of the toothache is pain
blr_bcyb0ui_4-5-rgb_front the more specific in terms of breaking down pain would be whether the pain was sharp and intense or dull and unrelenting
blr_bcyb0ui_5-5-rgb_front typically the sharp intense pains come suddenly and then are gone
blr_bcyb0ui_6-5-rgb_front the deeper pains are probably not as sharp or are sudden of impact but they stay in just the simple length of time is an issue
blr_bcyb0ui_7-5-rgb_front typically if a tooth is sensitive to hot or cold it means that the nerve in the tooth is still partially alive and it can respond to temperature
blr_bcyb0ui_8-5-rgb_front if the tooth is sensitive to air that also is an indication that the tooth is still alive
blr_bcyb0ui_9-5-rgb_front maybe damaged may have some other issues but there is still some live nerve tissue
blspqpnz15y_0-1-rgb_front part of our sport requires that a rider know how to go in select the correct cow bring it out and get it singled all by itself
blspqpnz15y_1-1-rgb_front our rider happens to have an easy right there we have decided that we are going to get the number three cow with the horn is
blspqpnz15y_10-1-rgb_front we just did not hold the heard as well as we would like to
blspqpnz15y_11-1-rgb_front all of those skills about working a cow are what make this part just as successful as learning to track and control it
blspqpnz15y_12-1-rgb_front we will go ahead and get one more cow and see if we can bring that one out
blspqpnz15y_13-1-rgb_front when we go into get the cow we are thinking about the cow and you put pressure on your good cow
blspqpnz15y_14-1-rgb_front pressure is almost magical to me
blspqpnz15y_15-1-rgb_front it means that the rider is just keep her eyes her horse on one particular cow as the rest of them stay back in with the heard
blspqpnz15y_16-1-rgb_front so we got that cow out pretty successfully just losing one in the process
blspqpnz15y_17-1-rgb_front most of the time we might have two or three what we call turn backs or heard settlers
blspqpnz15y_18-1-rgb_front that make this just a little bit easier and organized
blspqpnz15y_2-1-rgb_front all she needs to know is what we had learned in our previous segment about how to put pressure on the cow and ask it to come on out
blspqpnz15y_3-1-rgb_front by maneuvering our horse in between the cow and the heard and continuing to push on it
blspqpnz15y_4-1-rgb_front we will have her turn around now and go in and try and get one that is just a little bit more difficult
blspqpnz15y_5-1-rgb_front she will select a cow that makes her go into the heard in what we call you want to kind of slice it right down the middle
blspqpnz15y_6-1-rgb_front deciding which way do i want to send that cow
blspqpnz15y_7-1-rgb_front i am going to try to hold the heard with just one person that might be a little bit difficult but my job is to keep that heard form wanting to go bust or getting out of the of the boundaries we have set
blspqpnz15y_8-1-rgb_front cows want to return to where they came from so as she goes into get her cow she is trying to keep just the pressure on the one cow that she is after
blspqpnz15y_9-1-rgb_front so if she was going after the black cow and she was able to successfully get it out
bozv-ckvz1q_0-8-rgb_front alvin dedeaux the thing you want to watch out though is not to get in a habit of doing a lot of false cast for no reason
bozv-ckvz1q_1-8-rgb_front like i said there is a couple of uses for the false cast but most of the time you want to try to get that fly back in the water as quickly as you can
bozv-ckvz1q_2-8-rgb_front i mean the fish are not in the air so waiving your line around in the air is not going to catch any fish
bozv-ckvz1q_3-8-rgb_front and also every time that you make a false cast there is a chance you could do something wrong and mess up your cast tangle your line or whatever
bozv-ckvz1q_4-8-rgb_front so if you are using the false cast to lengthen your line you really do not need to make more than about four strokes so one two three four
bozv-ckvz1q_5-8-rgb_front and if you are using proper casting technique that is all the false casting you need to do to cast as far as you should ever need to cast
bozv-ckvz1q_6-8-rgb_front so just try not to make a habit of doing a lot of false casts unless you are trying to dry your fly out or you are trying to redirect your cast or you know move your fly over a different target
bozv-ckvz1q_7-8-rgb_front four strokes is usually all you need one two three four
bp8yvikdelg_0-5-rgb_front moving along
bp8yvikdelg_1-5-rgb_front our next step is called the shuffle turn with a pivot
bp8yvikdelg_10-5-rgb_front keep turning into a pivot step
bp8yvikdelg_11-5-rgb_front
bp8yvikdelg_12-5-rgb_front so it is an count move again
bp8yvikdelg_13-5-rgb_front and and
bp8yvikdelg_14-5-rgb_front if the turns make you a little dizzy
bp8yvikdelg_15-5-rgb_front and so start your shuffle turn
bp8yvikdelg_16-5-rgb_front just mambo and come back
bp8yvikdelg_17-5-rgb_front shuffle turn and mambo back to the bench
bp8yvikdelg_18-5-rgb_front sometimes when my students face the back of the room they get a little mixed up because they can not see the instructor anymore
bp8yvikdelg_19-5-rgb_front shuffle turn pivot and back to the bench
bp8yvikdelg_2-5-rgb_front if you remember our turn step moved us so that we were putting the opposite shoulder in
bp8yvikdelg_3-5-rgb_front we started with the right shoulder in
bp8yvikdelg_4-5-rgb_front we moved so we had the left shoulder in
bp8yvikdelg_5-5-rgb_front that is important to remember in the shuffle turn
bp8yvikdelg_6-5-rgb_front we did a rhythm change shuffle turn pivot
bp8yvikdelg_7-5-rgb_front there is actually turns in there
bp8yvikdelg_8-5-rgb_front if you get a little dizzy you can do a mambo instead
bp8yvikdelg_9-5-rgb_front shuffle turn is the first part
bpc1as0rh1i_0-8-rgb_front good afternoon my name is tom brintzenhofe i am here out of reading pennsylvania to show you how to change car brakes
bpc1as0rh1i_1-8-rgb_front i have already got the wheel off i got this thing up and supported to make time a little bit easier
bpc1as0rh1i_10-8-rgb_front take your old brake pad either way it does not matter that way or that way
bpc1as0rh1i_11-8-rgb_front grab your brake tool you can find it in any local parts store
bpc1as0rh1i_12-8-rgb_front they are under ten dollars
bpc1as0rh1i_13-8-rgb_front you want to slide that in here and push that in there to get both pistons you can actually see it going back in
bpc1as0rh1i_14-8-rgb_front you want to make sure both of them are all the way in get them turned in there like that
bpc1as0rh1i_15-8-rgb_front slide your caliber back over your new brake pads get your bolts back in tighten everything back up just remember pump your brake pedal up a few times before you go pulling out because your piston will not be exposed on your brake pads right away
bpc1as0rh1i_16-8-rgb_front that is all you need to do
bpc1as0rh1i_17-8-rgb_front tighten her up and you are good to go
bpc1as0rh1i_2-8-rgb_front what you want to do is look at your assembly here your brake caliper the only typically just two bolts holding it in
bpc1as0rh1i_3-8-rgb_front i have already located and loosened the bolts for you
bpc1as0rh1i_4-8-rgb_front you are going to take them out or take on of them out
bpc1as0rh1i_5-8-rgb_front rotate this upwards it is going to expose your entry front brake pads real simple just pull them right out
bpc1as0rh1i_6-8-rgb_front and again make sure you hold on to this
bpc1as0rh1i_7-8-rgb_front the last thing you want to do is drop that down on your fingers
bpc1as0rh1i_8-8-rgb_front grab one of your brand new brake pads and slide it in there
bpc1as0rh1i_9-8-rgb_front ok you want to take your inside brake pad stick it in the holder there get in the back one
bqq6nvgulay_0-3-rgb_front the next exercise that we are going to do is called seal puppy
bqq6nvgulay_1-3-rgb_front so take one hand and wrap it through one leg
bqq6nvgulay_2-3-rgb_front the other hand to wrap it through the other
bqq6nvgulay_3-3-rgb_front clap your feet three times together and just like on rolling like a ball inhale to go back clap your feet three times and come up on the exhale and clap your feet
bqq6nvgulay_4-3-rgb_front again do not let yourself roll so far forward that your feet touch
bqq6nvgulay_5-3-rgb_front but try to stop in the beginning position
bqq6nvgulay_6-3-rgb_front clap your feet again initiate with the pelvic tilt
bqq6nvgulay_7-3-rgb_front go back clap and come up
bqq6nvgulay_8-3-rgb_front you can vary the intensity of the exercise by pulling your feet in closer to you or by stretching them out farther away
bqq6nvgulay_9-3-rgb_front this just like rolling like a ball is an excellent massage for your spine
brkui98odoq_0-1-rgb_front open hand strikes
brkui98odoq_1-1-rgb_front i really like open hand strikes because you have less damage to your hand and also you do not really have to condition your hand to use that
brkui98odoq_2-1-rgb_front for an open hand i recommend hitting with the bottom basically the heel of your hand in a downward motion or an upward motion also a ridge hand which can be this part of your thumb the outside or the back side of your hand as well
brkui98odoq_3-1-rgb_front to hit i would use open hand for your neck and your jaw hits once again using the heel of your hand coming up or coming down
brkui98odoq_4-1-rgb_front for the ridge hand say you are going to strike in to the neck here it comes straight here boom or opposite side with the back of the hand here
brkui98odoq_5-1-rgb_front up down ridge ridge
brkui98odoq_6-1-rgb_front to strike in to the neck i go straight in with the ridge hand i would not really use a fist or the heel of your hand but use the ridge
brkui98odoq_7-1-rgb_front for the jaw line for the head you can use a fist as well but the open hand works best like i said because you are not really damaging your hand and yet it is still effective
brkui98odoq_8-1-rgb_front it still hurts the opponent
bsr7v1-5eui_0-8-rgb_front ok so now we have our pad with paper with some different fish species that we were interested in and some different points on them from the local fish dealer
bsr7v1-5eui_1-8-rgb_front we are going to take that home and we are going to go online
bsr7v1-5eui_10-8-rgb_front you want to know how hardy they are
bsr7v1-5eui_11-8-rgb_front you want to know their water requirements be it ph and temperatures and things like that
bsr7v1-5eui_12-8-rgb_front these are all important especially if you re putting together a community fish tank
bsr7v1-5eui_13-8-rgb_front we re going to need to find out all these different things about all these different fish that you want to try keeping
bsr7v1-5eui_14-8-rgb_front and then make sure that they are all within the same requirements
bsr7v1-5eui_15-8-rgb_front we can not very well keep fish that have different temperature requirements or different ph requirements together because we will be compromising the health of one species or another
bsr7v1-5eui_2-8-rgb_front we are going to hop onto the internet and we are going to do our own search on each of those individual species of fish
bsr7v1-5eui_3-8-rgb_front not say that your fish dealer is lying to you or wrong but different people have different opinions about things and sometimes have different personal experiences from different fish
bsr7v1-5eui_4-8-rgb_front we want to make sure that we get a wide scope of information about these various different species
bsr7v1-5eui_5-8-rgb_front i can t stress enough that the key to keeping fish happy and healthy is research
bsr7v1-5eui_6-8-rgb_front find out as much about that fish as you possibly can
bsr7v1-5eui_7-8-rgb_front you want to know where they come from
bsr7v1-5eui_8-8-rgb_front you want to know how big they get
bsr7v1-5eui_9-8-rgb_front you want to know what they eat
bum8cfhqg64_0-8-rgb_front now that we rinsed and washed our rice we are going to add our water and coconut milk and put it in our rice cooker and just be able to let it set
bum8cfhqg64_1-8-rgb_front if your cooking on the stove again your going to use cups of rice for cups of liquid but with the rice cooker because it holds in liquids so fully your going to use just cup of rice for cup of coconut milk and cup of water
bum8cfhqg64_2-8-rgb_front so we have got our rice all nice and clean i add in just under a cup of water because again the rice cooker does keep the liquid in so fully pour that in there we will pour in our cup of coconut milk because they will be about an inch of liquid covering the rice
bum8cfhqg64_3-8-rgb_front we will through this in here i stir it a little bit since we are using different kinds of liquid and very importantly you want to keep the lid on while the rice is cooking try to resist the temptation to open it up and see how is it doing
bum8cfhqg64_4-8-rgb_front flip down the lid and about minutes you will have some really sweet fragrant delicious rice to go with your stir fry
buzz_de8kbs_0-8-rgb_front i think it is a good idea to keep score when you are playing solitaire because most of the time when you play solitaire you are not going to win
buzz_de8kbs_1-8-rgb_front so keep a keep score say i am going to play four times or six times and my cumulative score i will remember that for the next time that i play this particular type of solitaire
buzz_de8kbs_2-8-rgb_front in this case the way i would keep score with this game is i would add up the cards remaining on the tableau and each one is worth one so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
buzz_de8kbs_3-8-rgb_front i have a score of fourteen and i am going to add that to what i am left with on the next one and so forth
buzz_de8kbs_4-8-rgb_front the idea is to get a lower score so if you do win a hand and it is not that hard give yourself a score of zero
buzz_de8kbs_5-8-rgb_front so if you have a cumulative score of say seventy next time hope that you can get sixty after your four games
busxa-igaf0_0-8-rgb_front already lets go to something else we can do with coconut and make coconut milk
busxa-igaf0_1-8-rgb_front first we take some shredded coconut and we pour it in the blender
busxa-igaf0_10-8-rgb_front what we are going to do is going separate the shredded part from the milky part
busxa-igaf0_11-8-rgb_front so we pour that one there like so
busxa-igaf0_12-8-rgb_front then we take the cheese cloth and we squeeze it
busxa-igaf0_13-8-rgb_front and you can see there is quite a bit of white milky substance coming out here
busxa-igaf0_14-8-rgb_front and you keep squeezing and squeezing
busxa-igaf0_15-8-rgb_front the shredded coconut you can put in and make candies with
busxa-igaf0_16-8-rgb_front because this shredded coconut is still good
busxa-igaf0_17-8-rgb_front and in fact if i wanted to i could put this back in the blender again do the same process all over again
busxa-igaf0_18-8-rgb_front and get a little bit more milk before i would be ready to take that shredded coconut and use it in some other ingredient to make possibly candies or cake
busxa-igaf0_19-8-rgb_front so that is how you make the good coconut milk
busxa-igaf0_2-8-rgb_front then we take usually you use two parts water to one part coconut
busxa-igaf0_3-8-rgb_front so we take some water now of course you want to use really spring water or some treated water
busxa-igaf0_4-8-rgb_front you do not want to use chlorinated water
busxa-igaf0_5-8-rgb_front because we want to make sure we want to make sure we have nice nice good coconut milk
busxa-igaf0_6-8-rgb_front then we take the blender and we turn it on
busxa-igaf0_7-8-rgb_front alright it does not take very long
busxa-igaf0_8-8-rgb_front now once we have done that lets push this aside a little bit
busxa-igaf0_9-8-rgb_front we have a little measuring cup and some cheese cloth
bv7yzyvngpo_0-5-rgb_front alright we are ready to talk about solutions
bv7yzyvngpo_1-5-rgb_front and at this point in the program what you want to do is pose possible solutions
bv7yzyvngpo_10-5-rgb_front so starts to become about compromise
bv7yzyvngpo_11-5-rgb_front these are the things that i really really want
bv7yzyvngpo_12-5-rgb_front this is what you really really want so i am going to have to compromise a little you are going to have to compromise a little so that we can both win
bv7yzyvngpo_13-5-rgb_front and that is what you are going for as you start to pose and create these solutions
bv7yzyvngpo_2-5-rgb_front now you notice i stressed possible because you are going to come up with some solutions but it do not think in terms of well these are our solutions and if these do not work then the relationship is over
bv7yzyvngpo_3-5-rgb_front you may go through a number of solutions before you find what actually works to repair the relationship
bv7yzyvngpo_4-5-rgb_front the first thing we have to look at when posing a solution is think in terms of strategies
bv7yzyvngpo_5-5-rgb_front you do not want a strategy that will not repair the relationship
bv7yzyvngpo_6-5-rgb_front and what i am talking about versus
bv7yzyvngpo_7-5-rgb_front i get everything i want you get nothing
bv7yzyvngpo_8-5-rgb_front ok this is what i want this is the relationship that i see and i am going to get all of it
bv7yzyvngpo_9-5-rgb_front the other person loses
bvr-ln22vwk_0-8-rgb_front my name is abby jones
bvr-ln22vwk_1-8-rgb_front and i am talking about things that can make the process of moving into a new space or apartment easy and efficient
bvr-ln22vwk_10-8-rgb_front and i do not need to find a permanent space for them here
bvr-ln22vwk_11-8-rgb_front because i am going to be using them all up to print letters
bvr-ln22vwk_12-8-rgb_front so that is just some examples of things that i am going to be giving away
bvr-ln22vwk_13-8-rgb_front that i do not or taking away from the apartment
bvr-ln22vwk_14-8-rgb_front so i do not need to spend time and energy finding a place to put them in this apartment
bvr-ln22vwk_2-8-rgb_front and so one of the things that i like to do is to keep an area in my new place where i keep things that i am going to give away or that i need to return to people
bvr-ln22vwk_3-8-rgb_front so as i have been unpacking things i have run across things that i need to return to people or that i do not want anymore
bvr-ln22vwk_4-8-rgb_front and i am putting them over here in this corner to help avoid clutter in the areas where i am going to be putting things away
bvr-ln22vwk_5-8-rgb_front so for instance these this tapestry and this pillow i had at my old apartment but i do not have space for it at this apartment
bvr-ln22vwk_6-8-rgb_front so i am going to be returning those to my parents who were lending that to me at my new apartment i mean my old apartment
bvr-ln22vwk_7-8-rgb_front these tension rods i was using in windows at my old apartment but i do not have the same space here
bvr-ln22vwk_8-8-rgb_front so i am going to be giving those away
bvr-ln22vwk_9-8-rgb_front these bags of paper and things i am using for a project that i am working on
bviorhqyvpu_1-8-rgb_front in this clip we will be talking about flavored white tea
bviorhqyvpu_2-8-rgb_front this white tea is a tea for people who do not like to drink straight white
bviorhqyvpu_3-8-rgb_front we have some kind of flavor which will enhance the appetite to drink this white tea
bviorhqyvpu_4-8-rgb_front the white tea which we are going to talk about is called white lovers cup
bviorhqyvpu_5-8-rgb_front it is a white tea with red rose and raspberry
bviorhqyvpu_6-8-rgb_front again it has a very low amount of caffeine and it has a higher amount of antioxidants in it
bviorhqyvpu_7-8-rgb_front so this can also be good with spicy foods if you are having anything spicy maybe you can have this iced or hot and it is really excellent
bviorhqyvpu_8-8-rgb_front it is delicate and it really brews a very lighter cup of tea
bviorhqyvpu_9-8-rgb_front it really produces a very natural yellowish licorice color i would say and the aroma again is excellent because it is flavored with rose petals and raspberry
bwmqblmhquy_0-8-rgb_front today we are going to talk about how to choose a depilatory wax for your type of waxing
bwmqblmhquy_1-8-rgb_front the first thing that you need to do is determine where on your body you are going to be waxing
bwmqblmhquy_10-8-rgb_front you can use either one for the underarms but if you have a person who is very sensitive very it might be more appropriate to use the hard wax for them
bwmqblmhquy_11-8-rgb_front the legs you know you can use the hard wax on the legs as well
bwmqblmhquy_12-8-rgb_front when you have larger areas i find the hard wax is very easy to manage because you do not need to use fabric with it
bwmqblmhquy_13-8-rgb_front it is a simpler step you just pull it right off and you are done so that would be how you would choose those waxes
bwmqblmhquy_2-8-rgb_front there is a couple different types of wax that you can use
bwmqblmhquy_3-8-rgb_front one wax is a softer wax and will require you to use a cloth fabric strip to remove the wax once you have applied it to the skin with a spatula
bwmqblmhquy_4-8-rgb_front the other kind of wax that is available is a harder wax
bwmqblmhquy_5-8-rgb_front we call it a hard wax although it is soft
bwmqblmhquy_6-8-rgb_front when you apply it to the skin it hardens and you do not need to use any kind of a fabric to remove it it actually is removed just by peeling it right off just as if it were a fabric strip
bwmqblmhquy_7-8-rgb_front so the type of wax that you would use for facial hair would be the softer wax where you would be required to use a cloth strip
bwmqblmhquy_8-8-rgb_front if you were were waxing for instance the bikini area it is much more appropriate to use the hard wax because this leaves no residue on the skin it is very good for sensitive areas
bwmqblmhquy_9-8-rgb_front it is also very good for the underarms
bxdrjbsxcai_0-3-rgb_front welcome to jeans and i am harmonie kreiger and i am here to show you what jeans are going to look best for your body type
bxdrjbsxcai_1-3-rgb_front now it is very important when you go into the store that you have a few brand names in mind just so you will know what brands you want to try on
bxdrjbsxcai_2-3-rgb_front you can try on a good five to ten pair of jeans before you find that one pair that fits you exactly right
bxdrjbsxcai_3-3-rgb_front now i am going to show you very different styles and very different washes of jeans so you know exactly what the differences are so when you go for shopping it will make it that much easier
bxdrjbsxcai_4-3-rgb_front my number one tip is to bring a friend with you so they can tell you what looks good on you and what does not
bxdrjbsxcai_5-3-rgb_front cause your opinion might not be the opinion that counts in this case
bxdrjbsxcai_6-3-rgb_front so just make sure you bring somebody with you and you look in four way mirrors
bxdrjbsxcai_7-3-rgb_front that is my advice and let is go right into the first pair of jeans
byijsqi2wzs_0-8-rgb_front did you know that guys need to have at least body fat and women need to have at least body fat for essential health
byijsqi2wzs_1-8-rgb_front i am carol ann with studio group x and we are going to talk about how to calculate body fat
byijsqi2wzs_10-8-rgb_front the second way that you can measure body fat is through infrared reading where you can measure the muscle tissue within the body
byijsqi2wzs_11-8-rgb_front another way is called bod pod where you are measuring the body weight in air displacement and then another way that you can measure body fat is through skin fold calipers
byijsqi2wzs_12-8-rgb_front now this seems to be pretty popular to get your body fat measured in the gyms or wellness centers or anywhere so basically what you do is you take this caliper and you measure different sites on the body
byijsqi2wzs_13-8-rgb_front you are measuring the thickness of the skin and you have what is called subcutaneous layer of fat underneath the skin and so you are just going to pinch different areas of the body and that is what we are looking at
byijsqi2wzs_14-8-rgb_front so a popular measurement is a three site measurement so you are going to measure tricep abs and thighs and then you sum up those skin folds you put it into a formula and that is how you calculate your body fat
byijsqi2wzs_2-8-rgb_front many people ask what is a healthy body fat range
byijsqi2wzs_3-8-rgb_front well for men it is anywhere between and body fat and then for women anywhere between and
byijsqi2wzs_4-8-rgb_front now what is that of what
byijsqi2wzs_5-8-rgb_front well your body is made up of lean mass tissue and then your fat mass tissue so it is a ratio
byijsqi2wzs_6-8-rgb_front so for guys between and of your total body weight should be fat and then women to
byijsqi2wzs_7-8-rgb_front now how do you measure body fat within your body
byijsqi2wzs_8-8-rgb_front well there are several different ways that you can measure body fat
byijsqi2wzs_9-8-rgb_front the gold standard is what we call underwater hydrostatic weighing and basically you have a big tank of water and you have an individual sit on a scale and then totally submerge themselves under the water
bzgb3xr6dwu_0_1_2-5-rgb_front this pageant has just led me to where i am playing soccer today thank you so point one should have it is own paragraph after you do the introduction
bzgb3xr6dwu_3-5-rgb_front and this is the paragraph that you want to talk about why you chose your platform and how you can relate to its issues
bzgb3xr6dwu_4-5-rgb_front for example i chose my platform prevention of elderly neglect because for years i had visited and seeing at nursing homes were never visited b their families and that really concerned me so that is how i chose my platform
bzgb3xr6dwu_5-5-rgb_front point two needs to discuss what you plan to do with your platform
bzgb3xr6dwu_6-5-rgb_front with my platform prevention of elderly neglect i will establish a program that people can get involve with to go visit nursing homes specifically targeting those individuals who are neglected by their families
bzgb3xr6dwu_7-5-rgb_front so that is something that you could incorporate into your second point is how specifically are you going to make a difference with your platform
bzfiiqg_cf8_0-5-rgb_front hi i am steve anthony
bzfiiqg_cf8_1-5-rgb_front i am a musician singer actor based out of new york and miami
bzfiiqg_cf8_10-5-rgb_front we are going to take tension off of the string until we hear no tone when we pluck it
bzfiiqg_cf8_11-5-rgb_front that is pretty much it
bzfiiqg_cf8_12-5-rgb_front and once we have released the tension from the string we simply take our clipper and cut the string anywhere at all
bzfiiqg_cf8_13-5-rgb_front it does not really matter where
bzfiiqg_cf8_14-5-rgb_front in this case we are just right over the f hole
bzfiiqg_cf8_15-5-rgb_front and unwind the string from the tuning peg toss it aside and then using our as you can see there is a little notch right here would pop the bridge pin out and remove the string
bzfiiqg_cf8_16-5-rgb_front now you want to do this with all of the strings on the guitar
bzfiiqg_cf8_17-5-rgb_front open up our package of strings and what we are going to do is we are going to need our second string here which actually is our fifth string i am sorry
bzfiiqg_cf8_18_19-5-rgb_front it is the a string take it out of the package place the ball end back into the bridge slot pop the bridge pin back in on top press it in firmly run the string through the nut and give it a couple of turns around the the peg and run the end of it through the hole in the peg
bzfiiqg_cf8_2-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about how to string a guitar
bzfiiqg_cf8_20-5-rgb_front and if that is not accessible you can always turn the key a little bit so that it comes into a more advantageous position for you
bzfiiqg_cf8_21-5-rgb_front run it through snug it up a little bit and then grab your peg winder if you have it handy
bzfiiqg_cf8_22-5-rgb_front if you do not you can just do it by hand
bzfiiqg_cf8_23-5-rgb_front start cranking till you get some tension on it and take up the slack in the peg
bzfiiqg_cf8_24-5-rgb_front and once you get the tension on the string you can take your clipper cut the excess off and then just repeat that procedure all the way down the guitar till you have done it six times and then you have restrung your guitar
bzfiiqg_cf8_25-5-rgb_front my name is steve anthony and this has been how to string a guitar
bzfiiqg_cf8_3-5-rgb_front now i as you can possibly see i have replaced this string with a nice new string
bzfiiqg_cf8_4-5-rgb_front the rest of em as you can see are a little bit discolored and darkened with age
bzfiiqg_cf8_5-5-rgb_front they are getting old
bzfiiqg_cf8_6-5-rgb_front it is time to take em off and put on some new ones
bzfiiqg_cf8_7-5-rgb_front first thing we do we take our lovely which has a peg winder and a clipper
bzfiiqg_cf8_8-5-rgb_front those are the two things we are going to need right away
bzfiiqg_cf8_9-5-rgb_front we are going to detune the string
bb2m6v4t7za_1-8-rgb_front the next thing we are going to do is to add kinds of sugar to our recipe and it is easy to get this right because you just need cup of each
bb2m6v4t7za_10-8-rgb_front it need to be at a high speed just enough so that it will mix nicely
bb2m6v4t7za_2-8-rgb_front we will start off with the white sugar which is in a container here and we just want to make sure that it is an even cup of sugar
bb2m6v4t7za_3-8-rgb_front you can use the edge of the knife and add that gradually and as that goes in it will mix with the margarine or in this case butter that has been creaming in this mixer bowl
bb2m6v4t7za_4-8-rgb_front as it is creaming you want to take another cup of brown sugar and this happens to be dark brown sugar i think this gives a nice flavor
bb2m6v4t7za_5-8-rgb_front you can also use light brown sugar
bb2m6v4t7za_6-8-rgb_front the important thing to remember is that it should be fresh so that it is easily put into the measuring container
bb2m6v4t7za_7-8-rgb_front i just stick it right into the bag and with your hand you can make sure you get an even amount
bb2m6v4t7za_8-8-rgb_front this is going to come out in a bit of a clump so i am going to turn it off for a moment and let that go in there and i will use this opportunity to scrape down the sides and the sides of the bowl and also to scrape the beaters so that this will get mixed in
bb2m6v4t7za_9-8-rgb_front you see it is getting nice and creamy now and that will continue as the brown sugar and the white sugar become incorporated into the mixture
bbgzcyimvci_1-2-rgb_front if you would like to find out more about what i do you can visit my website at www canineheadstart com
bbgzcyimvci_10-2-rgb_front another game you can play with dogs is if you teach them names of different toys
bbgzcyimvci_11-2-rgb_front you could call this for example a ball frisbee and see you could call this their bone
bbgzcyimvci_12-2-rgb_front if you use these names when you are playing with your dog repeatedly the dog will learn the difference between these objects and then you can lay them out on the floor and send your dog after different objects
bbgzcyimvci_13-2-rgb_front that would be called object recognition or distinction
bbgzcyimvci_14-2-rgb_front you can also play fetch
bbgzcyimvci_15-2-rgb_front teach your dog has to fetch which is a great way to burn off energy in an active dog
bbgzcyimvci_16-2-rgb_front you can play tug of war with dogs
bbgzcyimvci_17-2-rgb_front always you want to play tug where you are ending the game and you never want to play tug of war with a dog that has dominance issues and you can also play frisbee with your dog
bbgzcyimvci_18-2-rgb_front this is another great way for your dog to burn off energy and get some exercise
bbgzcyimvci_2-2-rgb_front so in this short clip we are going to be talking about what kind of games you can play with your dogs
bbgzcyimvci_3-2-rgb_front an example one great game you can play with your dog especially a dog that is recovering from some kind of surgery spade neutering or injury is hide and seek
bbgzcyimvci_4-2-rgb_front you are actually going to be playing hide and seek with the object and this would be a dog that move
bbgzcyimvci_5-2-rgb_front you also can obviously be playing with a dog that can be moving
bbgzcyimvci_6-2-rgb_front got a toy here and the toy is stuffed with some goodies
bbgzcyimvci_7-2-rgb_front i can put the toy on the floor and i can cover it with a pillow and then i ask the dog to go find the toy
bbgzcyimvci_8-2-rgb_front once the dog gets good at discovering the toy under a particular pillow you can actually set up a couple of different pillows
bbgzcyimvci_9-2-rgb_front this will keep your dog amused for quite a while
bbibbprt8im_0-5-rgb_front the last step of the tuneup process i am going to describe to you is what is known as the base grind or finishing belt and basically both processes are the same
bbibbprt8im_1-5-rgb_front the base grind uses a very fine gritted paper because what it is supposed to do is take away any scratches or anything and it will reveal any deep gouges in there
bbibbprt8im_2-5-rgb_front once you are done with the first base grind you go in there with epoxy and you fill in anything that it could not grind away and then what the finishing belt is supposed to do is it is supposed to get rid of all the bumpiness that the epoxy leaves after you drip it
bbibbprt8im_3-5-rgb_front i mean it does fill in the gouge but it does not make it nice and flat so what you are going to need to do with that again is same exact sort of thing as the base grind
bbibbprt8im_4-5-rgb_front if this was to be the edge of the belt go at an angle on it
bbibbprt8im_5-5-rgb_front hold it tail to tail and just press and this one you do not really want to apply that much force to it because it is just supposed to smooth it but with the base grind you do want to put something behind it because you are trying to show what is wrong with the board
bbnhk0g8fjy_1-8-rgb_front in my hands today i am holding a dumbo rat
bbnhk0g8fjy_10-8-rgb_front this rat is only two weeks old
bbnhk0g8fjy_11-8-rgb_front as you can see its eyes and ears are closed
bbnhk0g8fjy_12-8-rgb_front it will not be able to hear for six weeks
bbnhk0g8fjy_13-8-rgb_front it will be totally dependent on its mom up until about six weeks old when it will start eating regular rat food
bbnhk0g8fjy_14-8-rgb_front in this cage over here i have two rats this is my big daddy rat tar
bbnhk0g8fjy_15-8-rgb_front tar is also a rex rat but see he has normal ears they are at the top of his head
bbnhk0g8fjy_16-8-rgb_front tar is about eighteen months old
bbnhk0g8fjy_17-8-rgb_front he was my first rat he has a little white belly and little white feet
bbnhk0g8fjy_18-8-rgb_front and he is very intelligent he even knows his name and does tricks
bbnhk0g8fjy_19-8-rgb_front you can see the difference between the male and female rat
bbnhk0g8fjy_2-8-rgb_front this is blondie she is my little mommy dumbo rat
bbnhk0g8fjy_20-8-rgb_front the males are much bigger than the females
bbnhk0g8fjy_21-8-rgb_front and this is lucy she is a hairless rat she has regular ears
bbnhk0g8fjy_22-8-rgb_front but she has no hair the only hair is on the side of her head on her whiskers and at the top of her head
bbnhk0g8fjy_23-8-rgb_front sometimes that falls out and grows back
bbnhk0g8fjy_24-8-rgb_front but all over her body she has no hair
bbnhk0g8fjy_25-8-rgb_front rats come in many different colors hair types different body types and without tails if tails make you squeamish
bbnhk0g8fjy_3-8-rgb_front see how her ears are on the side of her head and not at the top of her head like regular rats
bbnhk0g8fjy_4-8-rgb_front she is also called a rex rat
bbnhk0g8fjy_5-8-rgb_front see how her hair is blonde going in this direction and if you push the fur in this direction its almost a silver grey
bbnhk0g8fjy_6-8-rgb_front rats make wonderful pets for family and children
bbnhk0g8fjy_7-8-rgb_front they do not bite or hardly ever bite
bbnhk0g8fjy_8-8-rgb_front they are extremely intelligent they come when they are called they can do tricks they get along with all the other family pets they are very low maintenance and they are very clean
bbnhk0g8fjy_9-8-rgb_front i have a few other rats to show you momma had some babies she had four other baby rats
bcgtwy6jndk_0-8-rgb_front hi i am jennifer cail
bcgtwy6jndk_10-8-rgb_front but then you will not be able to work with the dough with a wire whisk so you want a flat beater
bcgtwy6jndk_11-8-rgb_front you also want to make sure that your butter is room temperature
bcgtwy6jndk_12-8-rgb_front try to let it sit out for at least half an hour if not an hour or so before you are ready to use it
bcgtwy6jndk_13-8-rgb_front that will ensure that it is going to be soft enough to easily be beaten
bcgtwy6jndk_14-8-rgb_front you want to start it out at a slower speed just to get the butter moving a little bit you do not want to try and work your stand mixer to hard
bcgtwy6jndk_15-8-rgb_front we are going to speed it up a little bit to really cream that butter
bcgtwy6jndk_16-8-rgb_front now you can see that our butter has been nicely creamed and we are ready for the next step
bcgtwy6jndk_2-8-rgb_front our next step is going to be creaming the butter
bcgtwy6jndk_3-8-rgb_front for the amount of butter that we are going to be using is sticks which is also of a cup of butter
bcgtwy6jndk_4-8-rgb_front i highly recommend using a stand mixer
bcgtwy6jndk_5-8-rgb_front it will definitely save your arms verses to try to beat it with a wooden spoon
bcgtwy6jndk_6-8-rgb_front make sure you get all of the paper off
bcgtwy6jndk_7-8-rgb_front you do not want to leave any paper inside for it to be baked in the cookies
bcgtwy6jndk_8-8-rgb_front i am going to use a flat beater
bcgtwy6jndk_9-8-rgb_front if you use a wire whisk it is not going to be able to handle the butter unless the butter is super super soft almost melted
bcm7xvyczas_0-8-rgb_front there are lots of experiences that every dentist runs into that makes the day very hard
bcm7xvyczas_1-8-rgb_front some of the complications that we run into could be something as simple as just not getting the patient adequately numb
bcm7xvyczas_10-8-rgb_front we know that it is probably going to be a little more uncomfortable for the patient and certainly more difficult from our standpoint to get it out
bcm7xvyczas_11-8-rgb_front so it is just not as simple as going in and basically removing the tooth but sometimes it involves you know a little more gory detail to do things to basically remove the tooth
bcm7xvyczas_12-8-rgb_front basically it all goes back to being able to relate and being empathetic with the patient provided that you are listening to the patient and you are kind of understanding their concerns and you are kind of talking through this
bcm7xvyczas_13-8-rgb_front it is more about kind of letting them know that you are on their side and you guys are a team and working together to kind of get to a common good
bcm7xvyczas_14-8-rgb_front so most of the problems we encounter are usually resolved with just talking with the patient in a soft spoken way and an empathetic manner so that the patient knows that you can understand what they are going through
bcm7xvyczas_15-8-rgb_front you are trying to help them get through it
bcm7xvyczas_2-8-rgb_front that certainly causes distress to the patient but also to the dentist
bcm7xvyczas_3-8-rgb_front there have been many times where the patient comes in with such a big infection or they are just a complicated patient and it is very difficult to get them numb
bcm7xvyczas_4-8-rgb_front that is certainly one problem we encounter from time to time
bcm7xvyczas_5-8-rgb_front certainly because we have to take a lot of impressions on teeth or molds
bcm7xvyczas_6-8-rgb_front some people have real problems with things in their mouth so you can kind of stimulate this gag reflex
bcm7xvyczas_7-8-rgb_front so that can be difficult where you have a patient that has a really bad gag reflex that you can not get a very good impression on
bcm7xvyczas_8-8-rgb_front that is another complication
bcm7xvyczas_9-8-rgb_front another one that we run into from time to time is again if someone presents for an extraction and they want to get a tooth taken out and it is very badly broken
bchtw6ms9em_0-5-rgb_front now we notice this screw right here is coming out way too easy
bchtw6ms9em_1-5-rgb_front that means that the hole the screw goes into is kind of wallowed out and i will show you how to deal with that when we put the chair back together
bchtw6ms9em_2-5-rgb_front now we have the screws out
bchtw6ms9em_3-5-rgb_front as you can see this seat is set in a slight slot right here so what we want to do is tap the back a little bit and then come to the front and tap upward
bchtw6ms9em_4-5-rgb_front and there is our seat
bchtw6ms9em_5-5-rgb_front sometimes the seat is going to be cracked
bchtw6ms9em_6-5-rgb_front this seat had some boards screwed onto it to keep it together i took those off since we are going to it
bchtw6ms9em_7-5-rgb_front this seat has already been but i want to show you with this seat how to the seat
besloio5zri_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is cindy mastry with yoga etc
besloio5zri_10-8-rgb_front and then she is going to very slowly come out of it
besloio5zri_11-8-rgb_front it is important to come out of a pose slowly
besloio5zri_12-8-rgb_front and then extending the legs back into her dandasana and that is the compass pose
besloio5zri_2-8-rgb_front this is april and april is going to help demonstrate in this clip the compass pose
besloio5zri_3-8-rgb_front april is seated in dandasana lengthening up from the tailbone to her crown and reaching out through her heels
besloio5zri_4-8-rgb_front she is going to bring the soles of her feet together and allow her knees to fall out to the sides coming into baddha konasana or bound angle
besloio5zri_5-8-rgb_front she is then going to take her right foot and bring it up and take her right hand underneath her knee and take her right hand back to the ground by her hip
besloio5zri_6-8-rgb_front she is going to lengthen up she would going to reach her hand toward her foot and try to lengthen it up over her head
besloio5zri_7-8-rgb_front she is stretching through this side massaging the muscles on the other side
besloio5zri_8-8-rgb_front she is then going to release the foot and take her arm around for a bind and then she is going to point the toe toward the compass point
besloio5zri_9-8-rgb_front coming into the twist and bind that is beautiful
bevjrp2hs8o_0-4-rgb_front gina kennedy with our busy lifestyles and whatever we do gravity pulls us down and so we end up with rounded shoulders and a rounded back and posture that is not exactly where we would want it
bevjrp2hs8o_1-4-rgb_front so the dandasana pose staff pose is one that can counteract the forces of gravity and just life as it presents itself
bevjrp2hs8o_10-4-rgb_front good
bevjrp2hs8o_11-4-rgb_front she is going to lengthen up root down with her tailbone and lengthen up through the crown of her head
bevjrp2hs8o_12-4-rgb_front now faith has a very nice long spine
bevjrp2hs8o_13-4-rgb_front but but for some people who have been rounded for a good portion of their life they are still rounded
bevjrp2hs8o_14-4-rgb_front so i am going to ask faith to take these blocks and place them behind her hips just a little bit and she is going to press her hands
bevjrp2hs8o_15-4-rgb_front so it might be a little bit too high for you faith
bevjrp2hs8o_16-4-rgb_front so we are have to experiment to find which is the right spot
bevjrp2hs8o_2-4-rgb_front so faith is going to help me demonstrate dandasana
bevjrp2hs8o_3-4-rgb_front so she is going to extend her legs out in front of her
bevjrp2hs8o_4-4-rgb_front good
bevjrp2hs8o_5-4-rgb_front she is going to flex her feet press through her big toe mound and even spread her toes and pull her toes back towards her knees
bevjrp2hs8o_6-4-rgb_front good
bevjrp2hs8o_7-4-rgb_front she is going to press her calves right down into the ground
bevjrp2hs8o_8-4-rgb_front a and it is okay if her heels come off just a little bit
bevjrp2hs8o_9-4-rgb_front she is going to engage through her thighs
bezvrupjpwk_0-8-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson and what we want to talk about right now is the proper mechanics of making a good shot
bezvrupjpwk_1-8-rgb_front now it does not matter if you have got all of your body form perfectly correct ready to make a shot
bezvrupjpwk_10-8-rgb_front instead we want him to take that step around square his shoulders to the basket and make that shot
bezvrupjpwk_11-8-rgb_front same thing here
bezvrupjpwk_12-8-rgb_front if hunter is up here and he dribbles to the middle we want him to find the basket turn face the basket get his shoulders squared up and make the shot
bezvrupjpwk_13-8-rgb_front if you are squared if you are facing the basket you are going to up your chances tremendously of making that shot
bezvrupjpwk_2-8-rgb_front the most important thing in making a good shot is you got to be facing the basket
bezvrupjpwk_3-8-rgb_front i do not know how many times i have seen players with the greatest shots ever but they have chose to shoot going from the side or fading away or they shoot coming away from the basket or whatever
bezvrupjpwk_4-8-rgb_front the best way for you to become an accurate shooter is to have your body squared
bezvrupjpwk_5-8-rgb_front now you see our player right here has good form we have got a good base their hands are just perfectly set and the key is right here their shoulders
bezvrupjpwk_6-8-rgb_front if i took their shoulders and drew lines off their shoulders they are facing right to the basket
bezvrupjpwk_7-8-rgb_front that is where we are trying to score
bezvrupjpwk_8-8-rgb_front so right now you see that he is perfectly tilted toward the basket
bezvrupjpwk_9-8-rgb_front now if he takes a step down to the baseline he takes a step down the baseline we do not want him to shoot the ball from the shoulder coming over the top
beiobn0jb7c_0-5-rgb_front we are talking about how to make an easy and unique centerpiece
beiobn0jb7c_1-5-rgb_front for your table for any party
beiobn0jb7c_10-5-rgb_front you can use this centerpiece idea for anything
beiobn0jb7c_11-5-rgb_front so we can start with just a plain hat and build on from there
beiobn0jb7c_12-5-rgb_front or we can start with even party hats
beiobn0jb7c_13-5-rgb_front and these type of hats can be used for
beiobn0jb7c_14-5-rgb_front if you are having a soccer birthday party
beiobn0jb7c_15-5-rgb_front or if you are having a soccer party like your soccer team just won a championship
beiobn0jb7c_16-5-rgb_front and you need an idea for a centerpiece
beiobn0jb7c_17-5-rgb_front you can use a hat like this too
beiobn0jb7c_2-5-rgb_front now every party has a theme
beiobn0jb7c_3-5-rgb_front and it does not necessarily have to be like an obvious theme
beiobn0jb7c_4-5-rgb_front like this theme is a patriotic theme
beiobn0jb7c_5-5-rgb_front or this hat you could use for a st patrick is day party
beiobn0jb7c_6-5-rgb_front but even if you do not have something like that
beiobn0jb7c_7-5-rgb_front you are just wanting to throw a party
beiobn0jb7c_8-5-rgb_front and you want something to look like just elegant or classy
beiobn0jb7c_9-5-rgb_front or just fun
berpje71eny_0-4-rgb_front okay i have doused a little bit of this sand trap with water because we got a nice dry sunny day here
berpje71eny_1-4-rgb_front hitting out of wet sand is a little different because you are not able to get the loose sand underneath the ball as much
berpje71eny_10-4-rgb_front so work on your wet sand play and when you are confronted with it it will not bother you at all where it might make your opponent get a little nervous
berpje71eny_11-4-rgb_front so wet down the sand get in there and practice out of it and you will find that your skills will increase and you will not be fearful of virtually any lie that you could ever get
berpje71eny_2-4-rgb_front so i do not have any great advice for you on wet sand because i want you to do what we have talked about and just practice out of it
berpje71eny_3-4-rgb_front that is the best way to learn because the truth of the matter is sand everywhere is different
berpje71eny_4-4-rgb_front this is kind of brownish sand
berpje71eny_5-4-rgb_front at augusta national you will see that beautiful white sand and then all types of sand in between and in different climates sand can be a little denser or in the dry climates can be real loose because there is no moisture in it
berpje71eny_6-4-rgb_front so when you have the opportunity to practice out of wet sand or if you are at a range just moisten a part of the sand trap and work out of the wet sand
berpje71eny_7-4-rgb_front you will find it is very rewarding because if you were playing in a match and it just happened to rain the day before the sand could be wet
berpje71eny_8-4-rgb_front so you tend to hit the ball you can grab a little extra sand sometimes when it is wet but it is all different and that is why the sand is nothing that i can give you hardened fast rules on
berpje71eny_9-4-rgb_front but the only rule i really need to give you is you need to get a lot of reps around the sand because they have put sand traps in all golf courses and it is kind of a test
bfnbgx1ylde_0-4-rgb_front hi i am amelia and i am going to talk to you about ways to prevent hair breakage
bfnbgx1ylde_1-4-rgb_front first let is talk about what causes hair breakage
bfnbgx1ylde_10-4-rgb_front when you put a pony tail in you want to make sure that you do not use a rubber band
bfnbgx1ylde_11-4-rgb_front you can use something like this they are like rubber bands but they are specifically for hair
bfnbgx1ylde_12-4-rgb_front they slip out of the hair where as rubber bands tend to grab at the hair because they are rubber a little bit more less slip so the hair grabs and rips
bfnbgx1ylde_13-4-rgb_front this is a lot silkier so it does not grab
bfnbgx1ylde_14-4-rgb_front when you are coloring you want to make sure that any time you color and you are retouching anything you do not want to bring that color back over it is called overlapping
bfnbgx1ylde_15-4-rgb_front you do not want to overlap that color
bfnbgx1ylde_16-4-rgb_front so if you are trying to some roots you do not want to bring that i would not want to bring that brown all the way up or i would not want to bring this lightener all the way down
bfnbgx1ylde_17-4-rgb_front i would want to just do the spot that i needed to do and leave the rest out because the more you color something the more it breaks down the bonds the easier it is going to be to snap
bfnbgx1ylde_18-4-rgb_front so as long as you are gentle with your hair as far as combing coloring and if you are really concerned you can do maybe monthly protein treatments and that will help with the strength of your hair
bfnbgx1ylde_19-4-rgb_front and just make sure not to brush it too hard when it is wet it is in a weakened state because it can stretch so it only stretches to a certain point and then it snaps
bfnbgx1ylde_2-4-rgb_front when the hair is wet it is in a weakened state also chemical services can cause your hair to break
bfnbgx1ylde_20-4-rgb_front so just be gentle with your hair when it is wet and that will all help you prevent your hair from breaking
bfnbgx1ylde_3-4-rgb_front anything that actually weakens the bonds of the hair can cause your hair to break
bfnbgx1ylde_4-4-rgb_front so when your hair is wet you do not want to consistently pull it up
bfnbgx1ylde_5-4-rgb_front you also do not want to constantly be combing your hair roughly when it is wet
bfnbgx1ylde_6-4-rgb_front when it is wet you want to use your comb and lightly comb from the bottom up
bfnbgx1ylde_7-4-rgb_front remember hair is a fiber just like silk
bfnbgx1ylde_8-4-rgb_front some hair is like silk some hair is like denim
bfnbgx1ylde_9-4-rgb_front so figure out which one yours is like and treat it as such
bggb_uxi5sc_0-8-rgb_front hello my name is scott and i am the owner of climb on indoor rock climbing gym in wilmington north carolina
bggb_uxi5sc_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to discuss maintaining a climbing rope
bggb_uxi5sc_10-8-rgb_front every time that you are done with your rope you want to make sure that you put it in your climbing rope bag to keep it safe from the environment or any other things that would harm your rope like petroleum or acid
bggb_uxi5sc_11-8-rgb_front we are going to get it folded up in there
bggb_uxi5sc_12-8-rgb_front it rolls into the climbing rope bag which is also a great way to carry it
bggb_uxi5sc_13-8-rgb_front this has been maintaining your climbing rope
bggb_uxi5sc_2-8-rgb_front each climbing rope has a life expectancy
bggb_uxi5sc_3-8-rgb_front when you buy your climbing rope it will tell you how many falls it can take over how much period of time
bggb_uxi5sc_4-8-rgb_front i keep a lot on each one of my climbing ropes so i know how many times it has been outside where i have taken it and how many falls i have taken on it so that i can retire it at the proper time
bggb_uxi5sc_5-8-rgb_front another really important part of maintaining your climbing rope is to inspect your rope each and every time that you take it out of the bag
bggb_uxi5sc_6-8-rgb_front speaking of the bag you want to keep it in a rope bag and keep it out of the dirt out of the moisture and keep it well protected
bggb_uxi5sc_7-8-rgb_front climbing is inherently dangerous and can result in serious injury or death
bggb_uxi5sc_8-8-rgb_front so inspecting your rope maintaining your rope keeping it clean and dry is very important
bggb_uxi5sc_9-8-rgb_front any time that you talk about doing this you want to make sure that you get the proper instruction on how to inspect a climbing rope and how to calculate the amount of falls it can take
bhswgp3dsyi_0-8-rgb_front on this enlarger the bulb for the enlarger is located in this housing right up here
bhswgp3dsyi_1-8-rgb_front now this is not just your normal light bulb that you could at your house
bhswgp3dsyi_2-8-rgb_front it is a special photographic light bulb that you need to either order via the internet or by at a photographic supply store
bhswgp3dsyi_3-8-rgb_front it is very important that you get the right light
bhswgp3dsyi_4-8-rgb_front if you get the wrong type of bulb using a household bulb you are going to completely ruin whatever you are working on
bhswgp3dsyi_5-8-rgb_front so the bulb goes in up here and it just sort of screws on over here
bhswgp3dsyi_6-8-rgb_front one important thing about bulbs that i just learned actually was that a bulb will burn brighter as it is actually loosing life
bhswgp3dsyi_7-8-rgb_front so the filament in that bulb will actually start to burn bright thus changing some of your enlargement times
bhswgp3dsyi_8-8-rgb_front so you always want to kind of keep track of how many hours you have had that bulb for and also have a spare bulb
bhswgp3dsyi_9-8-rgb_front because there is nothing worse than having a great day of printing and your bulb blows and you do not have a backup bulb
bhwmlgcrgvu_0-8-rgb_front now that the base is on i am going to move on to the lid color
bhwmlgcrgvu_1-8-rgb_front i did a very natural base a matte color
bhwmlgcrgvu_10-8-rgb_front i am putting it on the lid of the eye
bhwmlgcrgvu_11-8-rgb_front by the lid of the eye i mean the ball of the eye which is where the eye ball protrudes
bhwmlgcrgvu_12-8-rgb_front i am just kind of dusting it over the lid up to the crease
bhwmlgcrgvu_13-8-rgb_front you do not want to go any further than this
bhwmlgcrgvu_14-8-rgb_front you want to get as close to the lash line as possible as well
bhwmlgcrgvu_15-8-rgb_front just blend blend blend
bhwmlgcrgvu_16-8-rgb_front i am kind of buffing it to the eye lid
bhwmlgcrgvu_17-8-rgb_front i want to see it but i do not want it to be so dramatic that it takes away from the rest of the look
bhwmlgcrgvu_18-8-rgb_front again i am not going any further than here because i want this to be kind of the highlight color and to be lighter
bhwmlgcrgvu_19-8-rgb_front open and look up
bhwmlgcrgvu_2-8-rgb_front kind of a yogurt vanilla color
bhwmlgcrgvu_20-8-rgb_front if you have got some underneath the eye that is fine
bhwmlgcrgvu_21-8-rgb_front no big deal
bhwmlgcrgvu_22-8-rgb_front just kind of blend it in and clean it up later
bhwmlgcrgvu_23-8-rgb_front if you get a little bit underneath that is fine because like i said what i do on top i like to do underneath
bhwmlgcrgvu_24-8-rgb_front close your eye
bhwmlgcrgvu_25-8-rgb_front keep it closed
bhwmlgcrgvu_26-8-rgb_front that is where the lid ends
bhwmlgcrgvu_27-8-rgb_front highlight and lid
bhwmlgcrgvu_3-8-rgb_front for the lid i am going to something a little more dramatic
bhwmlgcrgvu_4-8-rgb_front i am going to use a cranberry color and it is got a lot of shimmer to it and vibrance
bhwmlgcrgvu_5-8-rgb_front this is very similar color as we are using on the lips
bhwmlgcrgvu_6-8-rgb_front kind of a glossy burgundy color
bhwmlgcrgvu_7-8-rgb_front i am going to do it very lightly
bhwmlgcrgvu_8-8-rgb_front i am actually going to use a fluffier brush that i would normally use on the crease because i do not want it to be so concentrated on the lid
bhwmlgcrgvu_9-8-rgb_front i just want it to blend and just give kind of a shimmery hint
bibbepkaqmy_0-4-rgb_front hi this is john stewart and this is how to find water in the case of an emergency
bibbepkaqmy_1-4-rgb_front say you get stranded or lost going to want to find water
bibbepkaqmy_10-4-rgb_front to where it is not quite as dirty but it is still going to have some possible bacteria in it
bibbepkaqmy_11-4-rgb_front ok so you do not want to drink from mud puddles
bibbepkaqmy_12-4-rgb_front you do not want to drink from saltwater
bibbepkaqmy_13-4-rgb_front this stuff really drain is you
bibbepkaqmy_14-4-rgb_front you might think it is water but the saltwater is going to help not help at all
bibbepkaqmy_15-4-rgb_front it is too salty it takes and eats up more of the water that you have in your body
bibbepkaqmy_16-4-rgb_front ok some of the things about water
bibbepkaqmy_17-4-rgb_front there is bacteria in water and so your water going to need to be treated
bibbepkaqmy_18-4-rgb_front ok some people have filters sanitizers and other things that is going to kill that bacteria
bibbepkaqmy_19-4-rgb_front ok filtering water is not going to kill the bacteria
bibbepkaqmy_2-4-rgb_front your body can go two to three weeks without food but your body cannot go longer that two to three days without water or some type of liquid but basically you really need water
bibbepkaqmy_20-4-rgb_front so you got to treat the water other ways
bibbepkaqmy_21-4-rgb_front easiest way to do this is to boil water
bibbepkaqmy_22-4-rgb_front you can boil water for five to ten minutes and it is going to kill any bacteria
bibbepkaqmy_23-4-rgb_front there might still be a piece of dirt or something in there but all your bad bacteria is going to be gone
bibbepkaqmy_24-4-rgb_front to where you can safely drink the water and let it help you out in the long run and that is how to find water in case you have to survive in nature
bibbepkaqmy_3-4-rgb_front you want to find this fast and you want to try and find a large quantity of it
bibbepkaqmy_4-4-rgb_front first off water all ways flows down hill
bibbepkaqmy_5-4-rgb_front so if find a stream or something it will normally lead to a bigger body of water
bibbepkaqmy_6-4-rgb_front that you can draw from if you do draw from a stream
bibbepkaqmy_7-4-rgb_front you want to find swift moving water that is filtered by a lot of rocks
bibbepkaqmy_8-4-rgb_front so try and find a rock bet a little rock waterfall
bibbepkaqmy_9-4-rgb_front that rocks and stuff they naturally filter the water
bjqrrezhvqu_0-1-rgb_front there are entire books written on color
bjqrrezhvqu_1-1-rgb_front there are lots of books out on color
bjqrrezhvqu_10-1-rgb_front that purple and yellow are opposite
bjqrrezhvqu_11-1-rgb_front that orange and blue are opposite
bjqrrezhvqu_12-1-rgb_front and when you start messing around with color you start to realize how this works
bjqrrezhvqu_13-1-rgb_front you have got different ways to think about them
bjqrrezhvqu_14-1-rgb_front the hue is the first and most obvious dimension which usually identifies the color by name
bjqrrezhvqu_15-1-rgb_front you know whether it is red or blue
bjqrrezhvqu_16-1-rgb_front the intensity is the second dimension of color relative to the intensity of it is hue
bjqrrezhvqu_17-1-rgb_front the value locates the color is approximate position in relation to black and white
bjqrrezhvqu_18-1-rgb_front there is also the idea of thinking in terms of color as being symbolic
bjqrrezhvqu_19-1-rgb_front ok
bjqrrezhvqu_2-1-rgb_front so i am just going to make some very brief statements about color
bjqrrezhvqu_20-1-rgb_front so in western illumination for example the color blue is considered a very spiritual color
bjqrrezhvqu_21-1-rgb_front gold of course is considered very spiritual
bjqrrezhvqu_22-1-rgb_front we think of white as being for purity
bjqrrezhvqu_23-1-rgb_front but different people have different ideas about what is symbolic to them
bjqrrezhvqu_24-1-rgb_front and as an artist as a calligrapher you certainly have your choice about that
bjqrrezhvqu_25-1-rgb_front so one of the things that i want to say about color first of all i think i showed you before that i keep my used gouache in these handy little little containers and the lid pops off
bjqrrezhvqu_26-1-rgb_front they are really fun and you can get these at restaurant supply store
bjqrrezhvqu_27-1-rgb_front but you do not want to use them if there is been food inside
bjqrrezhvqu_28-1-rgb_front so start clean with these
bjqrrezhvqu_3-1-rgb_front first of all i do not get too much into color theory
bjqrrezhvqu_4-1-rgb_front i like to mess around with color the same way some people like to mess around in boats
bjqrrezhvqu_5-1-rgb_front but you might want to get yourself a thing called a color wheel which is something that helps you think about colors
bjqrrezhvqu_6-1-rgb_front shows you how colors can work
bjqrrezhvqu_7-1-rgb_front so that it it is actually kind of like a time saver
bjqrrezhvqu_8-1-rgb_front and these are not too hard to find
bjqrrezhvqu_9-1-rgb_front and up here just a few terms that you might want to pay attention to you know if this were our simplified color wheel you would see that red and green are opposite color
bkf8lt9cumc_0-5-rgb_front now that explained what the picture cards and tens are worth and the aces are worth you have your other cards you have your twos thru your nines
bkf8lt9cumc_1-5-rgb_front four of each and again you have four suits
bkf8lt9cumc_2-5-rgb_front you have your spades your hearts your diamonds and your clubs
bkf8lt9cumc_3-5-rgb_front so for example worth exactly what you see the nine is worth a nine the six is worth a six and the two is worth a two
blrbyoifbss_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is michael orkin and i am a television producer
blrbyoifbss_1-5-rgb_front how do you become a television producer
blrbyoifbss_10-5-rgb_front that means a lot of hard work
blrbyoifbss_11-5-rgb_front it means coming up with great ideas
blrbyoifbss_12-5-rgb_front it means studying television and i mean watching a lot of television seeing what is happening cause television does change over time
blrbyoifbss_13-5-rgb_front right now everything is reality based
blrbyoifbss_14-5-rgb_front that means coming up with a great idea for getting a crew to go out and shoot things get them edited get them put on tv
blrbyoifbss_15-5-rgb_front it is just hard work but that is what television being that is how you get to be a television producer
blrbyoifbss_16-5-rgb_front it is hard work
blrbyoifbss_2-5-rgb_front well there is a lot of different ways because becoming a television producer simply means that you are producing pieces of video that end up on television or cable
blrbyoifbss_3-5-rgb_front and how do you do that
blrbyoifbss_4-5-rgb_front i went to college and became a got a degree in broadcast journalism and then went into small markets and learned how to produce television
blrbyoifbss_5_6-5-rgb_front that is one way another way is to simply take your home video camera go out shoot things get them edited and get them on tv your local cable access could put it on the air for you
blrbyoifbss_7-5-rgb_front and that would make you a low end television producer but a television producer
blrbyoifbss_8-5-rgb_front the best way to get into mainstream television production i think is to get a college degree in television get in get your foot in the door somewhere somehow
blrbyoifbss_9-5-rgb_front get a job producing television
bmbnypxiu5a_0-3-rgb_front there are some exciting things happening in the field of amateur astronomy
bmbnypxiu5a_1-3-rgb_front big toys that the big boys use to use are now trickling down and becoming affordable for us guys
bmbnypxiu5a_2-3-rgb_front such things as very high quality cameras that have extreme sensitivity and you can see things that were only dreamed of a few short years ago say or years ago
bmbnypxiu5a_3-3-rgb_front in fact you can get cameras now that will show you things like the horse head nebula on a small telescope where in years past you had to have a large telescope and be on top of a mountain in some dark remote location
bmbnypxiu5a_4-3-rgb_front so if you have a small to medium sized telescope and you are interested in amateur astronomy and rather than spending the money on a larger telescope you might want to look into buying one of these cameras such as mallincam and stellacams these devices are amazing they will show you many many more things than what you think your telescope is capable of showing you now
bnioz-4u3xw_1-8-rgb_front let is go
bnioz-4u3xw_10-8-rgb_front now it is asking what kind of point of interest do we want
bnioz-4u3xw_11-8-rgb_front do we want a category a specific category a restaurant a shopping center or company names
bnioz-4u3xw_12-8-rgb_front we would pick a restaurant and just like that we have all the places that are remotely close to us
bnioz-4u3xw_13-8-rgb_front so i want to pick let is see we can scroll down
bnioz-4u3xw_14-8-rgb_front i am in the mood for subway so i click subway
bnioz-4u3xw_15-8-rgb_front it ask me again if i need to be there in a specific time
bnioz-4u3xw_16-8-rgb_front we are just going to click no on that plans the route pretty short route minutes and about miles
bnioz-4u3xw_17-8-rgb_front click done that is it we are ready to navigate to subway
bnioz-4u3xw_2-8-rgb_front chapter choosing your destination with points of interest
bnioz-4u3xw_3-8-rgb_front this is probably the biggest difference between all gps systems ya they may have a couple of extra features that another one will not have but the biggest thing is point of interest
bnioz-4u3xw_4-8-rgb_front tomtom and garmin and other types have the most of points of interest
bnioz-4u3xw_5-8-rgb_front what a point of interest is if you are looking for restaurants or a park you simple type that in
bnioz-4u3xw_6-8-rgb_front so in this case again the tomtom we are going to do a search of point of interest
bnioz-4u3xw_7-8-rgb_front simply click the screen once we are going to go to navigate to click points of interest
bnioz-4u3xw_8-8-rgb_front now it is asking if we want a point of interest that is close to us in the same city near my home along our route or any other destination
bnioz-4u3xw_9-8-rgb_front so we are going to say a point of interest that is just near us
bo3g_k9xspy_0-8-rgb_front alright here is an example of how to land a fish on a jig rod
bo3g_k9xspy_1-8-rgb_front i have got a fish on
bo3g_k9xspy_10-8-rgb_front above all you have to be patient
bo3g_k9xspy_11-8-rgb_front now when you get that fish up towards the hole what i like to do is just kneel down a little bit so i can help to guide it up if i need to
bo3g_k9xspy_12-8-rgb_front even reach my hand down into the hole if i need to
bo3g_k9xspy_13-8-rgb_front and here we have got a nice little large mouth bass
bo3g_k9xspy_14-8-rgb_front nothing big but that is but those basic points still hold true for any any size fish
bo3g_k9xspy_15-8-rgb_front be patient
bo3g_k9xspy_16-8-rgb_front do not allow any slack in the line and bring it up
bo3g_k9xspy_17-8-rgb_front when the fish wants to take line let it take line and you will land more fish
bo3g_k9xspy_2-8-rgb_front not too big
bo3g_k9xspy_3-8-rgb_front you can see a little bit of a bend in the rod
bo3g_k9xspy_4-8-rgb_front but the most important thing to do when you are landing a fish on a jig rod is always maintain a straight line
bo3g_k9xspy_5-8-rgb_front you do not want any slack in the line because that is going to give that fish an opportunity to get off the hook
bo3g_k9xspy_6-8-rgb_front so in so you always want that slack you always want that line nice and straight
bo3g_k9xspy_7-8-rgb_front you want to keep your rod tip up a bit
bo3g_k9xspy_8-8-rgb_front let the fish if the fish wants to fight this one is not not fighting real well but if the fish wants to fight and take out line like this let it go
bo3g_k9xspy_9-8-rgb_front let it take its line let it tire himself out and be patient
boguncjjm8q_0-8-rgb_front i am suzie with splore
boguncjjm8q_1-8-rgb_front now that we know a little bit more about adaptive seating and adaptive paddling for people with disabilities while going canoeing let is talk about ways to make your canoe a little bit more safe and more stabilized
boguncjjm8q_10-8-rgb_front a lot of times kids will be sitting in a canoe and they will lean out to the side because they want to splash the water but they do not always comprehend that shifting the weight and leaning out to the side can very easily tip a canoe
boguncjjm8q_11-8-rgb_front and so these stabilizer floats will help prevent that from happening
boguncjjm8q_2-8-rgb_front what i have here is what we call canoe stabilizing floats
boguncjjm8q_3-8-rgb_front basically all it is is an aluminum frame that can adjust its size according to your canoe
boguncjjm8q_4-8-rgb_front it can go wider or shorter
boguncjjm8q_5-8-rgb_front and then on the top here are just foam pads that rest in the water and they will help make your canoe a little bit more stabilized meaning that your canoe if the weight in the canoe shifts to one side or another these floats here will help keep your canoe upright
boguncjjm8q_6-8-rgb_front that is usually the biggest problem with canoeing whether you are canoeing with friends or kids or people with disabilities is keeping the canoe stabilized
boguncjjm8q_7-8-rgb_front so this is great to use for somebody that might have poor balance control and their weight might shift in the canoe
boguncjjm8q_8-8-rgb_front it will help keep this stabilized
boguncjjm8q_9-8-rgb_front it is also great for to use if you want to go with your kids
bpyauv3jnic_1-8-rgb_front it should really spring back and feel dry
bpyauv3jnic_10-8-rgb_front this is a good treat for the kids they would all want that top of the cake
bpyauv3jnic_11-8-rgb_front okay
bpyauv3jnic_2-8-rgb_front another way to check it is to insert a toothpick in the center of the cake if it comes out with sticky batter then the cake is not finish and then you cake put that in for another minutes and then check it again
bpyauv3jnic_3-8-rgb_front now our cakes are done
bpyauv3jnic_4-8-rgb_front if you have cooling racks place them on the cooling rack
bpyauv3jnic_5-8-rgb_front now it is time to frost our cakes
bpyauv3jnic_6-8-rgb_front you have to make sure that the cakes are completely cool before you start because if they are even a little warm it is going to melt your frosting and you will just have a mess
bpyauv3jnic_7-8-rgb_front first we want to have a nice hat box shape cake
bpyauv3jnic_8-8-rgb_front we are going to take off this cakes they are a little to round we are going to take off the top
bpyauv3jnic_9-8-rgb_front a shredded knife is the best thing to use for that and we would just nice and horizontally trim off the top of that cake
br-gjid-yfa_0-5-rgb_front okay we want to talk a little bit about tractor safety and this is a really important issue and a really big issue so we are just going to touch on some key points and then get into more detail later
br-gjid-yfa_1-5-rgb_front first thing we want to talk about some of the equipment that you want to make sure that your tractor has on it
br-gjid-yfa_10-5-rgb_front now an important note to make there you should never get off your tractor and do anything with this implement or with the pto shaft when it is running
br-gjid-yfa_11-5-rgb_front to a degree that shield is an idiot proofing feature but it is important nonetheless and you want to make sure your tractor is equipped with it
br-gjid-yfa_12-5-rgb_front moving forward here this little device here is a clutch safety switch or starter interlock it is commonly called
br-gjid-yfa_13-5-rgb_front this little device will will not allow the starter to engage unless you have the clutch pedal fully depressed
br-gjid-yfa_14-5-rgb_front and that is important because if this tractor is in gear and a neighbor kid comes up and turns the key on if it does not have this feature the tractor will start and it is in gear it will immediately start moving and people get crushed in that manner
br-gjid-yfa_15-5-rgb_front so you want to make sure your tractor is equipped with that switch and then you want to make sure that you are always in the saddle when you start the tractor with your seatbelt buckled
br-gjid-yfa_16-5-rgb_front lastly with implements it is a big issue again but you want to make sure that you are when you are moving around when you are transporting with implements raised up either on your lift or if we had a front end loader on the front of this tractor you want to move around with those implements as low as possible to avoid an imbalance and and decrease the likelihood of an overturn
br-gjid-yfa_17-5-rgb_front one thing that can help with that if you look on the front of the tractor here we have some suitcase weights and those are intended to balance the weight of a rear implement and you can see we could add quite a few more to this tractor
br-gjid-yfa_18-5-rgb_front but with these on the front when you raise your lift and pick your implement up in the back it will keep everything stable keep the front wheels of the tractor on the ground
br-gjid-yfa_19-5-rgb_front those are the basics check back for some more segments with more detailed and in depth information on tractor safety
br-gjid-yfa_2-5-rgb_front probably the most important is your protection structure or rops for short
br-gjid-yfa_3-5-rgb_front this is a folding unit here it allows you to fold it down if you need clearance to get it into a shed or garage
br-gjid-yfa_4-5-rgb_front this is what is going to protect you in the event of an overturn and those happen every year in america people get killed
br-gjid-yfa_5-5-rgb_front it is very important to buy a tractor that is equipped with an osha certified protection structure
br-gjid-yfa_6-5-rgb_front an important part of that is the seatbelt
br-gjid-yfa_7-5-rgb_front you will not be protected if you are not in this center area inside the protective zone so you always want to wear your seat belt when you are on the tractor
br-gjid-yfa_8-5-rgb_front the next thing is a pto shield
br-gjid-yfa_9-5-rgb_front this little metal guard here is to keep articles of clothing or hair or anything like that from getting tangled in the pto shaft when it is turning
brd68xy2rzs_0-8-rgb_front here is an icebreaker game an improv exercise called enemy defender and i love this game
brd68xy2rzs_1-8-rgb_front it is really good for getting people moving around the room
brd68xy2rzs_10-8-rgb_front they want to fill it out
brd68xy2rzs_11-8-rgb_front so they are just going to keep moving around
brd68xy2rzs_12-8-rgb_front not just walking in a circle
brd68xy2rzs_13-8-rgb_front and i tell them to be very sneaky and very secretive and out of the corner of their eye they are going to pick another person in the room
brd68xy2rzs_14-8-rgb_front and do not let them know you have picked them
brd68xy2rzs_15-8-rgb_front so everybody is walking around the room and they are going to pick this other person and i say just keep your eye on them
brd68xy2rzs_16-8-rgb_front keep it cool
brd68xy2rzs_17-8-rgb_front do not let them know
brd68xy2rzs_18-8-rgb_front just keep moving open space
brd68xy2rzs_19-8-rgb_front this person they do not know it but they are your enemy
brd68xy2rzs_2-8-rgb_front it is also a great way to introduce closeness to people that might not necessarily get that close in their regular work but in a really kind of safe playful way
brd68xy2rzs_20-8-rgb_front they are your secret enemy so keep your eye on them
brd68xy2rzs_21-8-rgb_front that usually gets a little laugh and then people keep walking and i say okay again secretly very sneaky out of the corner of your eye pick a second person in the room
brd68xy2rzs_22-8-rgb_front so you have got your eyes on two people
brd68xy2rzs_23-8-rgb_front you have got your eye on your enemy and this second person who also does not know it but they are your defender
brd68xy2rzs_24-8-rgb_front so everybody is walking around the room really sneaky really subtle keeping their eye on their enemy and defender
brd68xy2rzs_25-8-rgb_front and then i tell them this
brd68xy2rzs_26-8-rgb_front when i say go you are going to try and keep your defender between you and your enemy
brd68xy2rzs_27-8-rgb_front when i say go you are going to try and keep your defender between you and your enemy
brd68xy2rzs_28-8-rgb_front now before i say go and i always say this
brd68xy2rzs_29-8-rgb_front before i say go remember safely first
brd68xy2rzs_3-8-rgb_front kind of break down some of those boundaries
brd68xy2rzs_30-8-rgb_front it is just a game okay
brd68xy2rzs_31-8-rgb_front so once people know they are going to be cool and be safe then i say go and everybody starts scrambling around the room because everybody is picked different people for their enemies and defenders and they are trying to position themselves in the right place and people get squished up against the wall and people are spread out and they are giggling and elbowing each other and it is super fun and i usually just let them go until people start breathing heavy or getting tired or the giggling is peaked and i say okay freeze
brd68xy2rzs_32-8-rgb_front relax with your right arm point to your enemy bink
brd68xy2rzs_33-8-rgb_front with your left arm point to your defender bop
brd68xy2rzs_34-8-rgb_front and everybody laughs
brd68xy2rzs_35-8-rgb_front oh you were my enemy
brd68xy2rzs_36-8-rgb_front you were my defender
brd68xy2rzs_37-8-rgb_front and it is a great icebreaker
brd68xy2rzs_38-8-rgb_front it is pretty fast and it gets the energy way up
brd68xy2rzs_39-8-rgb_front it gets people moving and gets people close together in a way that does not feel too creepy
brd68xy2rzs_4-8-rgb_front so here is how you do enemy defender
brd68xy2rzs_40-8-rgb_front so that is one of my favorites
brd68xy2rzs_41-8-rgb_front it is called enemy defender
brd68xy2rzs_42-8-rgb_front oh yeah and if you are working with kids i usually call it something like apples and oranges
brd68xy2rzs_43-8-rgb_front you do not have to use those kind of villainous terms
brd68xy2rzs_44-8-rgb_front that is enemy defender an improv icebreaker
brd68xy2rzs_5-8-rgb_front i like to facilitate this game with everyone walking around the room
brd68xy2rzs_6-8-rgb_front so that is the first thing i do
brd68xy2rzs_7-8-rgb_front i invite everybody to come down into this space
brd68xy2rzs_8-8-rgb_front move around the room and just move to open space
brd68xy2rzs_9-8-rgb_front kind of disperse themselves like atoms and then in the space
btsrrqawn6k_0-4-rgb_front when we do a hearing assessment there are three parts of the auditory system that we are primarily evaluating
btsrrqawn6k_1-4-rgb_front the first part is the outer ear so we examine the external part of the ear which we refer to as the pinna and the ear canal
btsrrqawn6k_10-4-rgb_front the cochlea is a snail shaped boney device that is fluid filled and contains all of the sensory nerves that detect sound
btsrrqawn6k_2-4-rgb_front we use a device called an autoscope which is essentially a light with a magnifying lens to look into the ear canal and we can see as far as the ear drum
btsrrqawn6k_3-4-rgb_front the second part of the assessment evaluates the middle ear
btsrrqawn6k_4-4-rgb_front in the middle ear that is the space behind the ear drum in a normal healthy ear it is an air filled space
btsrrqawn6k_5-4-rgb_front in there we have three little bones that are referred to as the asocales
btsrrqawn6k_6-4-rgb_front the middle ear space it functions as a impedance matching device so it takes sound that is being transmitted in the ear which hits the ear drum and causes the ear drum to vibrate
btsrrqawn6k_7-4-rgb_front the bones the vibration of the ear drum then sets those bones into motion and the function of that whole middle ear system is to transfer the sound energy from air to th inner ear which is the fluid filled space
btsrrqawn6k_8-4-rgb_front so the middle ear is a mechanical system the inner ear is the part of the assessment we are evaluating when we are doing the pure tone testing or the part of the assessment where we are determining how soft sounds at specific frequencies need to be for someone to hear them
btsrrqawn6k_9-4-rgb_front that is where we are evaluating what is known as the inner ear or the cochlea

btwqxw3e8g8_0-8-rgb_front there are good and bad photo copies for the process we are going to go through today
btwqxw3e8g8_1-8-rgb_front for a general guideline contrast
btwqxw3e8g8_10-8-rgb_front these shoulder areas are going to be very pronounced in our transfer because it is nice and dark
btwqxw3e8g8_11-8-rgb_front for the lighter areas that you do have they are also really flanked by darks so the shapes are still going to be there
btwqxw3e8g8_12-8-rgb_front it is ok to be light or you know to be close to white that is fine
btwqxw3e8g8_13-8-rgb_front but you have to have a defining darker shapes around your photo copy
btwqxw3e8g8_14-8-rgb_front so you can see here like around the eyes the hair the shoulders those are all going to show up really well or going to help kind of fill in the rest of the face in your minds eye
btwqxw3e8g8_15-8-rgb_front now a lot of photo copy machines will have a contrast
btwqxw3e8g8_16-8-rgb_front and where you can darken and lighten and use more or less toner for your photo copy
btwqxw3e8g8_17-8-rgb_front in general if you are going to make like an average black and white photocopy do at least one or two extra in terms of the darkness and see what you get
btwqxw3e8g8_18-8-rgb_front usually a photo copy that you think is going to be too extreme and too glaring will be really perfect for our photo copy transfer
btwqxw3e8g8_2-8-rgb_front lots of contrasts
btwqxw3e8g8_3-8-rgb_front you are going to see that if you have lots of gray that is sort of washed out colors on your photo copy they will transfer they will be there but they will not really show up that well
btwqxw3e8g8_4-8-rgb_front what you want you want contrast you want the shapes to come out
btwqxw3e8g8_5-8-rgb_front take for example this photo copy
btwqxw3e8g8_6-8-rgb_front i have a guy in a mask
btwqxw3e8g8_7-8-rgb_front why do i have this
btwqxw3e8g8_8-8-rgb_front well he makes a good example
btwqxw3e8g8_9-8-rgb_front first off his neckline and jacket is very dark this is going to show up

bunolsdikxo_0-8-rgb_front hi
bunolsdikxo_10-8-rgb_front people with cognitive disabilities in therapeutic riding can work on numbers letters do sequencing memory
bunolsdikxo_11-8-rgb_front a lot of things with horseback riding there are two things you are doing at once
bunolsdikxo_12-8-rgb_front you are steering a horse and kicking them with your legs at the same time
bunolsdikxo_13-8-rgb_front it brings in a lot of cognitive functions that people do not really think about usually when they are riding
bunolsdikxo_14-8-rgb_front people with psychological disabilities horseback riding and horse interaction is wonderful for people with problems with attachments sexual abuse survivors they make an attachment with the horse they learn to trust they learn respect and that translates into their real life
bunolsdikxo_15-8-rgb_front that is what this is all about
bunolsdikxo_16-8-rgb_front horseback riding and horses helping people reach out reaching potentials in their lives they never expected to
bunolsdikxo_2-8-rgb_front if you have a son or daughter or know someone with a physical mental or even psychological disability sometimes horseback riding can be really beneficial
bunolsdikxo_3-8-rgb_front the best way to find out is to actually ask your child is doctor or therapist if they have ever heard of horseback riding therapy
bunolsdikxo_4-8-rgb_front also call hippa therapy
bunolsdikxo_5-8-rgb_front what we do here at hearts adaptive riding is called therapeutic riding because there is no therapists on staff actually doing therapy
bunolsdikxo_6-8-rgb_front it is horseback riding for people with disabilities
bunolsdikxo_7-8-rgb_front it teaches them skills but also they have the benefits of therapeutic riding with physical cognitive and psychological benefits
bunolsdikxo_8-8-rgb_front but if you know someone with a disability look up riding
bunolsdikxo_9-8-rgb_front people with physical disabilities obviously they get a physical workout they improve their muscle tone they work on their balance and stability
bvyuubpwesg_0-3-rgb_front now i know a lot of people out there avoid peanuts for whatever reason possibly allergies you can do the same thing with almond butter
bvyuubpwesg_1-3-rgb_front we are going to use peanut butter today you can get it trader joe is or raw almond butter i have done it with this its every bit is delicious
bvyuubpwesg_2-3-rgb_front so just so you know if peanut in your diet use almond butter
bvyuubpwesg_3-3-rgb_front okay
bvyuubpwesg_4-3-rgb_front so let is get started
bvyuubpwesg_5-3-rgb_front first thing we need to make peanut dip is of course peanut butter and i always use organic whenever possible but also want to use one that is unsweetened unsalted and you can always add these things
bvyuubpwesg_6-3-rgb_front i think to buy it is to buy things in their more natural whole state is best
bvyuubpwesg_7-3-rgb_front if you need more salt if you need more sweet you can always add it you can not take it away
bvyuubpwesg_8-3-rgb_front so buy as pure of an ingredient as whole food of an ingredient as you can
bvyuubpwesg_9-3-rgb_front this is a couple of organic peanut butter and i am using the cream make because this is a dip and i want it smooth

bwlhaeu1h90_10-5-rgb_front basically you can just go ahead sit down in the boat put your feet in it like this and you are ready to go
bwlhaeu1h90_11-5-rgb_front so kayaks are great if you want to be out on a day like to today where it is nice and sunny
bwlhaeu1h90_12-5-rgb_front you are going to get wet
bwlhaeu1h90_13-5-rgb_front there are holes in the boat which allow water when it gets in the boat to drain out of the boat
bwlhaeu1h90_14-5-rgb_front so the one thing about kayaks you will get a little wetter than kayaks
bwlhaeu1h90_15-5-rgb_front the next kayak we are going to look at will be the kayak
bwlhaeu1h90_16-5-rgb_front this is a recreational model
bwlhaeu1h90_17-5-rgb_front if you can see how large the cockpit is
bwlhaeu1h90_18-5-rgb_front it will be different from a touring kayak with a smaller cockpit
bwlhaeu1h90_19-5-rgb_front the reason for this style of cockpit is it is easier to get in and out of
bwlhaeu1h90_2-5-rgb_front the great thing about kayaks is they are easy to get in and out of
bwlhaeu1h90_20-5-rgb_front so these are usually made for just day touring around the lakes things like that
bwlhaeu1h90_21-5-rgb_front notice the width on this boat from here to here that is going to make the boat a lot more stable than other kayaks
bwlhaeu1h90_22-5-rgb_front the wider the boat is the more stable it will be
bwlhaeu1h90_23-5-rgb_front the flatter the bottom also will bring up the stability
bwlhaeu1h90_24-5-rgb_front one problem though is if you look there is no keel on the bottom of this boat
bwlhaeu1h90_25-5-rgb_front that means it will turn very easily whether you want it to turn or not
bwlhaeu1h90_26-5-rgb_front so a boat like this is not going to track well which means going straight as well as the next boat we will see
bwlhaeu1h90_27-5-rgb_front but again the reason they make a recreational cockpit like this which is about inches is just for ease of getting in and out
bwlhaeu1h90_28-5-rgb_front so all you have to do is put your feet in it like this and get in
bwlhaeu1h90_29-5-rgb_front usually be some foot braces inside the boat which are adjustable for the length of your legs
bwlhaeu1h90_3-5-rgb_front if you flip them over they are easy to get back in on top of the water
bwlhaeu1h90_30-5-rgb_front the next boat we are going to look at will be a touring kayak
bwlhaeu1h90_31-5-rgb_front the first two boats we looked at were about feet long this one is about feet long
bwlhaeu1h90_32-5-rgb_front it has a hatch which is watertight you can put some things in it
bwlhaeu1h90_33-5-rgb_front usually they have a front and back hatch depending on what model you have
bwlhaeu1h90_34-5-rgb_front the difference with this boat is the length of the cockpit
bwlhaeu1h90_35-5-rgb_front if you notice the length on this cockpit is about inches long it is a lot narrower
bwlhaeu1h90_36-5-rgb_front this boat is going to be harder to get in and out but it is possible if you flip in this boat if you are wearing a skirt to actually roll it back up
bwlhaeu1h90_37-5-rgb_front so when we look at the bottom of this boat see how narrow this boat is
bwlhaeu1h90_38-5-rgb_front it is about inches wide where the first two boats we looked at were about inches wide
bwlhaeu1h90_39-5-rgb_front it is going to make this boat a lot less stable but also faster
bwlhaeu1h90_4-5-rgb_front so looking at a kayak they are all basically the same
bwlhaeu1h90_40-5-rgb_front this is boat is feet long which will also make it faster
bwlhaeu1h90_41-5-rgb_front and if you look at the front and back of these boats notice how they have on them this will make going straight a lot easier for you
bwlhaeu1h90_42-5-rgb_front the only problem is it will make turning a lot harder
bwlhaeu1h90_43-5-rgb_front so what you give up in going straight in the other boats you gain in this boat but turning this one will be a lot harder
bwlhaeu1h90_5-5-rgb_front most of them have a chicken line that runs around the outside that is to help you get back in the boat or to hold on to
bwlhaeu1h90_6-5-rgb_front they have some type of foot wells or foot pedals in them depending if they do or do not have a rudder
bwlhaeu1h90_7-5-rgb_front if you are lucky they will have a nice comfortable seat with a backrest
bwlhaeu1h90_8-5-rgb_front some do not but it is a lot more comfortable if you grab one with a backrest
bwlhaeu1h90_9-5-rgb_front but like i said the best thing about a kayak is the ease of getting in and out
bwnfdmdvwfq_0-4-rgb_front hi my name is mary thinnes and i am a skin care expert
bwnfdmdvwfq_1-4-rgb_front now i am going to discuss with you dehydrated skin and how to properly treat dehydrated skin
bwnfdmdvwfq_2-4-rgb_front do not get confused because dehydrated skin is different from dry skin
bwnfdmdvwfq_3-4-rgb_front dry skin is actually a skin type and dehydrated skin is a condition
bwnfdmdvwfq_4-4-rgb_front dry skin is lacking in oil and dehydrated skin is lacking in water
bwnfdmdvwfq_5-4-rgb_front not only does it have to do with properly hydrating your body with water just because someone drinks more water does not mean that their skin is going to actually be hydrated like they want to and have that healthy skin glow but you have to properly treat your skin as well
bwnfdmdvwfq_6-4-rgb_front with dehydrated skin you want to definitely do proper home care treatments your masks on a basis you want to break down your papayas to break down those dead skin cells because you do not want to get that surface build up but at the same time with dehydrated skin moisturizing is the most important step for them as well
bwnfdmdvwfq_7-4-rgb_front you definitely want to use more products with pure hyaluronic acid in it for more mature skin use the moisturizers that have the antioxidants in them and your vitamins in there
bwnfdmdvwfq_8-4-rgb_front also your vitamin c serum the specialty product i mentioned before is going to help with dehydrated skin to help tighten brighten and lighten the skin
bwnfdmdvwfq_9-4-rgb_front as far as that goes that is the way to properly treat dehydrated skin
bwvtaii4pg0_0-5-rgb_front alright guys for our next shine what we are going to teach you is called a tightrope
bwvtaii4pg0_1-5-rgb_front okay
bwvtaii4pg0_10-5-rgb_front so let is break it down for you guys
bwvtaii4pg0_11-5-rgb_front we are going to cross over in front on one
bwvtaii4pg0_12-5-rgb_front guys we are also going to cross again on two with our right leg and cross again on three
bwvtaii4pg0_13-5-rgb_front what is really important here guys is that you use your hips
bwvtaii4pg0_14-5-rgb_front okay
bwvtaii4pg0_15-5-rgb_front do not think it is nothing feminine it is just trying to get your feet around
bwvtaii4pg0_16-5-rgb_front okay
bwvtaii4pg0_17-5-rgb_front so again using your hips guys with our arms at home base we are going to cross on one cross two cross three
bwvtaii4pg0_18-5-rgb_front now the biggest thing here also guys remember stay on the balls of your feet
bwvtaii4pg0_19-5-rgb_front try not to stay because that is going to be easy to trip yourself on the pattern
bwvtaii4pg0_2-5-rgb_front take a look i am going to start off with a basic five six basic
bwvtaii4pg0_20-5-rgb_front so here we go
bwvtaii4pg0_21-5-rgb_front nice and slow
bwvtaii4pg0_22-5-rgb_front cross on one cross on two cross on three pause on four
bwvtaii4pg0_23-5-rgb_front right here guys we are going to continue to do it for three more counts
bwvtaii4pg0_24-5-rgb_front cross on five cross on six cross on seven
bwvtaii4pg0_25-5-rgb_front go right into our basic
bwvtaii4pg0_26-5-rgb_front one two three five six seven
bwvtaii4pg0_27-5-rgb_front okay
bwvtaii4pg0_28-5-rgb_front so let me demonstrate it one more time for you guys
bwvtaii4pg0_29-5-rgb_front maybe i should do it this way
bwvtaii4pg0_3-5-rgb_front one two three five six seven
bwvtaii4pg0_30-5-rgb_front five six basic
bwvtaii4pg0_31-5-rgb_front one two three five six seven

bwvtaii4pg0_7-5-rgb_front with a basic five six and one two three five six seven
bwvtaii4pg0_8-5-rgb_front one two three five six basic one two three five and stop
bwvtaii4pg0_9-5-rgb_front okay
bxph-lrp-my_0-8-rgb_front my name is ryan parker with parker home renovations in new braunfels texas and today i am going to teach you how to replace a cabinet door hinge
bxph-lrp-my_1-8-rgb_front if you have a cabinet door hinge that is either fallen off or bent or is rusted shut at your house you may have to replace it
bxph-lrp-my_10-8-rgb_front so you will hold the door in place and then you will line it up with the other doors and then you will pop a screw in the top and the bottom of each hinge
bxph-lrp-my_11-8-rgb_front my name is ryan parker with parker home renovations
bxph-lrp-my_12-8-rgb_front and that is how you fix a door hinge
bxph-lrp-my_13-8-rgb_front you can visit me at parkerhomerenovations com
bxph-lrp-my_2-8-rgb_front now the first thing you are going to want to do is you want to take a look at the hinge that is currently on the door and try to find one that is similar to it that will fit in the same application
bxph-lrp-my_3-8-rgb_front these hinges here you can get at just about any any local hardware store and these are very good hinges to keep the door shut and they are very sturdy and very strong
bxph-lrp-my_4-8-rgb_front now what you are going to want to do is you are going to want to take the old hinges off the door
bxph-lrp-my_5-8-rgb_front now once you take the old hinges off the door you are not going to be able to use the existing holes where the screws go because those holes may be stripped out or you want to find new wood to screw to so the hinges will hold better
bxph-lrp-my_6-8-rgb_front now what you do is you will mount the hinge on the back of the cabinet door two inches from the top of the door two inches from the bottom of the door on the hinge side
bxph-lrp-my_7-8-rgb_front you will want to slide it into place and you will want to pop a screw in each one of these holes here on the back of the door
bxph-lrp-my_8-8-rgb_front now once you get both hinges put on the top and on the bottom of the door you will want to hold the door in place
bxph-lrp-my_9-8-rgb_front now this hinge here mounts on the outside of the facing of the cabinet
bxzjo0cmuyc_0-8-rgb_front hi
bxzjo0cmuyc_10-8-rgb_front i am going to be installing mine on my center panel and i am going to install it a little under feet up on the door
bxzjo0cmuyc_11-8-rgb_front this should be a good height for everyone that lives in the household
bxzjo0cmuyc_2-8-rgb_front in this video clip i will be showing you step for installing a wide angle door viewer
bxzjo0cmuyc_3-8-rgb_front this is the door viewer that we will be installing
bxzjo0cmuyc_4-8-rgb_front it is also known as a peep hole
bxzjo0cmuyc_5-8-rgb_front in this entry way there are no windows or other way to tell who is on the other side of that door
bxzjo0cmuyc_6-8-rgb_front by installing this door viewer it will really aid in our safety
bxzjo0cmuyc_7-8-rgb_front you want to make sure when installing your door viewer that you pick a location that looks good on the door
bxzjo0cmuyc_8-8-rgb_front obviously the center would look a lot better than if it were on one of the sides
bxzjo0cmuyc_9-8-rgb_front the next thing to consider is that your height that you are installing your door viewer is that all people living in your household can look through it
byclh8sn7wg_0-8-rgb_front there are other things you need to keep in mind about when not to massage your horse
byclh8sn7wg_1-8-rgb_front if your horse is very tired and is having a hard time staying focused on you they may just want some time left alone in their stall or left alone to chill out with their friends before they can enjoy a massage
byclh8sn7wg_10-8-rgb_front i will do some body work on them
byclh8sn7wg_11-8-rgb_front they will relax
byclh8sn7wg_12-8-rgb_front they will feel better
byclh8sn7wg_13-8-rgb_front the horse may not agree with that assessment
byclh8sn7wg_14-8-rgb_front so they may want you to just back off and let them get acclimated
byclh8sn7wg_15-8-rgb_front pay attention to what your horse is trying to tell you
byclh8sn7wg_2-8-rgb_front so pay attention to that
byclh8sn7wg_3-8-rgb_front if they are really cranky you know it could be too hot for them it could be too buggy it could be too cold it could be too anything
byclh8sn7wg_4-8-rgb_front it could just be a day that they just do not feel having to focus on that for a while
byclh8sn7wg_5-8-rgb_front if they are sick again you want to make sure that your veterinarian has given you clearance on it
byclh8sn7wg_6-8-rgb_front and even if your vet has said sure go ahead with it that does not mean that your horse is necessarily going to feel like that
byclh8sn7wg_7-8-rgb_front so do not try to impose what you want to do on the horse let the horse be your guide
byclh8sn7wg_8-8-rgb_front the horse could be too agitated for whatever reason in a new location
byclh8sn7wg_9-8-rgb_front and you might think oh this is great
bypeefgkwyw_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about who invented homework
bypeefgkwyw_1-8-rgb_front i did some research on this
bypeefgkwyw_10_11_12-8-rgb_front if you want to be an architect you better be able to do your professor your architecture professor is homework if not you are going to be an architect
bypeefgkwyw_13-8-rgb_front if you are studying to be a doctor or a lawyer
bypeefgkwyw_14-8-rgb_front all your teachers are going to give you homework
bypeefgkwyw_15-8-rgb_front now when you are in college you do not have to do the homework
bypeefgkwyw_16-8-rgb_front it is not required
bypeefgkwyw_17-8-rgb_front but then of course when test time comes around
bypeefgkwyw_18-8-rgb_front if you did not do your homework
bypeefgkwyw_19-8-rgb_front more likely you are going to fail that test
bypeefgkwyw_2-8-rgb_front and i have no idea who invented homework
bypeefgkwyw_20-8-rgb_front and you are not going to become an architect or lawyer or doctor
bypeefgkwyw_21-8-rgb_front or whatever chosen field you decided to pursue
bypeefgkwyw_22-8-rgb_front so who invented homework
bypeefgkwyw_23-8-rgb_front maybe you can find that and let me know
bypeefgkwyw_24-8-rgb_front because i do not know
bypeefgkwyw_3-8-rgb_front most people probably want to choke the guy who invented homework
bypeefgkwyw_4-8-rgb_front if you are a student
bypeefgkwyw_5-8-rgb_front but it is probably more important to talk about why homework was invented
bypeefgkwyw_6-8-rgb_front o k
bypeefgkwyw_7-8-rgb_front it was not invented to make your life miserable
bypeefgkwyw_8-8-rgb_front although many students will probably think that
bypeefgkwyw_9-8-rgb_front but it was made so you could master a subject through a skill
bz-afk_q_1w_0-5-rgb_front okay once you have all your squares cut you want to go ahead and go back and iron them
bz-afk_q_1w_1-5-rgb_front obviously once they are cut up it is kind of you have got to kind of guess at what needs to be ironed at what on what level what setting
bz-afk_q_1w_2-5-rgb_front a lot of times when you iron it the edges will not look as straight again so you can go back and snip off edges to square it off again
bz-afk_q_1w_3-5-rgb_front i do not iron it until after i have the squares cut because it is just impossible to try to iron the ones with all the seams and everything in it it would take you forever
bz-afk_q_1w_4-5-rgb_front and if you have like this is a velvet piece i do not want to iron it on that side but i can iron it on the back as long as i have it set low enough
bz-afk_q_1w_5-5-rgb_front and as you are ironing them just go ahead and stack them up
bz-afk_q_1w_6-5-rgb_front and you can have all different size of blocks as long as you kind of figure out a way to piece them together
bzty65xt4_o_0-3-rgb_front finely for lips is lip gloss very important
bzty65xt4_o_1-3-rgb_front get a good color probably something lighter than the lipstick
bzty65xt4_o_10-3-rgb_front and there you go
bzty65xt4_o_2-3-rgb_front what i like to do is put a little on the base of my palette which is the back of my hand and sometimes i like to mix in a few colors
bzty65xt4_o_3-3-rgb_front depending on what you like i like natural light colors and you can blend them in with the same brush that i just used for the lipstick just remove some of the residue of the lipstick before you apply it
bzty65xt4_o_4-3-rgb_front get a good amount there mix it in and what i like to do is put it mainly in the center of my lip
bzty65xt4_o_5-3-rgb_front both on the bottom and the top
bzty65xt4_o_6-3-rgb_front it also makes your lipstick last longer because it gets that nice moist feeling on your lips without drying out
bzty65xt4_o_7-3-rgb_front because lipstick does dry your lips out quite a lot
bzty65xt4_o_8-3-rgb_front and get a good amount spread it around and to the corners of your lips as much as possible
bzty65xt4_o_9-3-rgb_front you want to make sure that you go with something that is nice natural and is not going to or draw too much attention to your lips
c0umdwywvf0_0-5-rgb_front so i am just going to discuss for a moment the nature of sort of random collaging as opposed to thinking about all of these very complex dynamics of highlights and shadows
c0umdwywvf0_1-5-rgb_front because there is a lot of thinking that gets involved in making that process happen
c0umdwywvf0_10-5-rgb_front some areas lighter than others to create dynamic
c0umdwywvf0_11-5-rgb_front but because this was more of an abstract piece because this was more of a just purely collaged random piece it was not necessary for me to think oh i need to have a highlight here and a shadow there
c0umdwywvf0_12-5-rgb_front i was being a little more at random
c0umdwywvf0_13-5-rgb_front a little more free to cut pieces out place them as i will and see how they worked together that way
c0umdwywvf0_2-5-rgb_front whereas something like this piece which i did within i do not know maybe a half an hours time
c0umdwywvf0_3-5-rgb_front i was not really thinking about that
c0umdwywvf0_4-5-rgb_front i wanted to just be a little more random
c0umdwywvf0_5-5-rgb_front i cut the pieces at random
c0umdwywvf0_6-5-rgb_front i fit them at random a little more
c0umdwywvf0_7-5-rgb_front similarly as i did in a piece such as this
c0umdwywvf0_8-5-rgb_front i was not really trying to consider shadow and highlights specifically
c0umdwywvf0_9-5-rgb_front some areas i made sure were darker than others
c11s3-7gekg_1-5-rgb_front now we are going to go ahead and take a look at our shape
c11s3-7gekg_10-5-rgb_front instead of using and and our left hand to play that g and the b we are actually going to use and
c11s3-7gekg_11-5-rgb_front what that is going to do is allow us to take our index finger and bring it down to hit that f that is our f there
c11s3-7gekg_12-5-rgb_front when we hit it all together it makes it a little bit easier to play it that way using this shape
c11s3-7gekg_13-5-rgb_front that is the
c11s3-7gekg_2-5-rgb_front again reviewing from our scale degree segment our is going to consist of our g the scale degree of which is our b which is our d and now we are going to add our flat in there we just take our natural which would be an f sharp drop it down it becomes an f natural
c11s3-7gekg_3-5-rgb_front reviewing our shape it is pretty similar to our g major
c11s3-7gekg_4-5-rgb_front we have got our g our b our and our d g again
c11s3-7gekg_5-5-rgb_front now instead of playing the d and g up here i actually dropped this down to a b which is another note of our chord
c11s3-7gekg_6-5-rgb_front it is okay to do that as long as we are playing notes of the chord
c11s3-7gekg_7-5-rgb_front and it makes it a little bit easier to get to this f which is our flat
c11s3-7gekg_8-5-rgb_front okay i am looking over here at the scale flat that is going to be our highest note there
c11s3-7gekg_9-5-rgb_front and what we are going to do is play it a little bit differently than we play our g major shape
c1lkiz9m8xo_0-9-rgb_front hi my name is dan schmidt from the chinese martial arts center
c1lkiz9m8xo_1-9-rgb_front today we are going to showing you proper self defense against the front choke
c1lkiz9m8xo_10-9-rgb_front ok from here you can do whatever you want
c1lkiz9m8xo_11-9-rgb_front ok mainly a knee would be best because their groin is right there
c1lkiz9m8xo_12-9-rgb_front ok closest to you
c1lkiz9m8xo_13-9-rgb_front so he grabs take the hand pull down step back and twist hit straight up then knee right to the groin
c1lkiz9m8xo_14-9-rgb_front ok it is very important as you practice this you want to get used to grabbing striking and twisting all at the same time
c1lkiz9m8xo_15-9-rgb_front ok so he grabs should be more like this so you are here one and then two and three
c1lkiz9m8xo_16-9-rgb_front ok it is important that when he grabs ok you want to grab with one side and step back with the other
c1lkiz9m8xo_17-9-rgb_front this way i am on balance
c1lkiz9m8xo_18-9-rgb_front ok so if he tries to wrestle with me and twist you know i can move around
c1lkiz9m8xo_19-9-rgb_front i am more pliable
c1lkiz9m8xo_2-9-rgb_front ok so if somebody chokes you from the front with two hands
c1lkiz9m8xo_20-9-rgb_front now if i stepped back with this side and he twists see i go right off balance
c1lkiz9m8xo_21-9-rgb_front so you want to incorporate all those together
c1lkiz9m8xo_22-9-rgb_front so he grabs and all at once step here here
c1lkiz9m8xo_23-9-rgb_front and then straight with the knee
c1lkiz9m8xo_24-9-rgb_front that is the proper way to perform self defense against a front choke
c1lkiz9m8xo_3-9-rgb_front ok there is a few very important steps
c1lkiz9m8xo_4-9-rgb_front first you want to take your left hand you want to place it on their arm
c1lkiz9m8xo_5-9-rgb_front ok you want to keep your elbow down
c1lkiz9m8xo_6-9-rgb_front ok this is like an anchor
c1lkiz9m8xo_7-9-rgb_front at the same time with your opposite leg in this case your right leg you want to step back ok step deep enough so you are shorter than they are
c1lkiz9m8xo_8-9-rgb_front you want to punch straight to the solar plexis as you twist your hips
c1lkiz9m8xo_9-9-rgb_front then take your hand again and palm straight up to the chin
c2klk-rr89u_0-8-rgb_front now we have all heard stories about those malicious cats
c2klk-rr89u_1-8-rgb_front you know the little more evil ones
c2klk-rr89u_10-8-rgb_front so we draw on our triangular mouth there and opposed to smiling we are not going to have that evil of a cat this cat is just frowning
c2klk-rr89u_11-8-rgb_front there will still be some whiskers but they will be close in
c2klk-rr89u_12-8-rgb_front it will be a very narrow face
c2klk-rr89u_13-8-rgb_front also it is ears are going to be out a little further
c2klk-rr89u_14-8-rgb_front almost kind of like horns
c2klk-rr89u_15-8-rgb_front the rest of the cat is body and posture are going to likewise be cold
c2klk-rr89u_16-8-rgb_front we are just going to have this cat is kind of be skulking and hulking like cats can do
c2klk-rr89u_17-8-rgb_front bring out the claws there it is tail is going to be up maybe even waving a little bit adding a couple of lines if you want to add the idea of motion
c2klk-rr89u_18-8-rgb_front draw in some forepaws right there
c2klk-rr89u_19-8-rgb_front there you go
c2klk-rr89u_2-8-rgb_front now every feline is different but certainly there have been a couple that have given cats a bad name
c2klk-rr89u_20-8-rgb_front and automatically our cat looks angry
c2klk-rr89u_21-8-rgb_front this cat does not look happy i would not want to meet it in a back alley
c2klk-rr89u_22-8-rgb_front and you can see just with a little bit of manipulation of a lot of the lines we have already covered how you can make a very happy feline look pretty angry at the world
c2klk-rr89u_3-8-rgb_front that said drawing a malicious cat offers an excellent exercise in how different lines will very quickly change the features of our cat cartoons
c2klk-rr89u_4-8-rgb_front so here we have our happy cat
c2klk-rr89u_5-8-rgb_front notice real quick the features how we have the half circles with the rounded corner above
c2klk-rr89u_6-8-rgb_front now with an evil cat we are going to flip that around
c2klk-rr89u_7-8-rgb_front basically going to have the top of the lines be flat and then our circles underneath
c2klk-rr89u_8-8-rgb_front now right away i have not drawn anything else that does not look like the happiest of creature
c2klk-rr89u_9-8-rgb_front in this case this creature is going to be a kitty
c4az5nstt7i_0-2-rgb_front hi i am diana korten and i am here today with ben to talk about common cat illnesses
c4az5nstt7i_1-2-rgb_front i have chosen ben to do this segment with us because he gets urinary tract infections pretty easily
c4az5nstt7i_10-2-rgb_front i am just filling this box with the health check litter and what will happen is when the cat goes to the bathroom it will just be yellow
c4az5nstt7i_11-2-rgb_front if the cat peas and it stays yellow then that is a sign that things are probably
c4az5nstt7i_12-2-rgb_front if the color changes and you get a red that usually tells you that there is a little urine in the blood and you want to get he cat to have it checked out
c4az5nstt7i_13-2-rgb_front ben is being very cooperative today and we are going to see how his urine comes out
c4az5nstt7i_14-2-rgb_front it is looking very yellow and it is just looking very yellow so that tells us that ben is doing very well today
c4az5nstt7i_15-2-rgb_front if it changed color then that would tell us that we need to be on the look out and we need to take him to the vet
c4az5nstt7i_16-2-rgb_front the reason why we are in the bathroom today is that for some reason cats are drawn to the bathroom when they are not feeling well
c4az5nstt7i_17-2-rgb_front a cat with a urinary tract infection will often pea right over the drain so if you come in the bathroom and you smell a little cat urine odor or you see a little yellow around the drain that is a good sign that your cat might have a urinary tract infection and you want to rush him to the vet because they can die from uti is
c4az5nstt7i_18-2-rgb_front some ways that you can help your cat prevent from getting uti is and kidney failure is to keep them well hydrated
c4az5nstt7i_19-2-rgb_front i would like to advocate feeding your cat wet food which contains a lot of water
c4az5nstt7i_2-2-rgb_front basically you want to watch for things like loss of appetite
c4az5nstt7i_20-2-rgb_front cats are not natural drinkers
c4az5nstt7i_21-2-rgb_front occasionally you will get a cat who loves to drink a lot of water but most cats are not really good water drinkers
c4az5nstt7i_22-2-rgb_front they are originally a desert animal
c4az5nstt7i_23-2-rgb_front their ancestors got most of their moisture from their kill so giving them a wet diet means that they get a lot of moisture in their food like their ancestors did
c4az5nstt7i_24-2-rgb_front from day one you want to take your cat in for an annual health check even if there is nothing going on
c4az5nstt7i_25-2-rgb_front once your cat gets to be eight years old you really want to take that cat in once every six months to get a little blood work done get these things checked out because a lot of things there are a lot of illnesses that your vet can catch early that do not have to be terminal but if you catch them late if you wait for your cat to point you to the symptoms you may find that by that time it is really too late
c4az5nstt7i_3-2-rgb_front you want to check their fur and if their fur gets dehydrated
c4az5nstt7i_4-2-rgb_front you want to pull on it like this and you see how ben is just sort of pops back down
c4az5nstt7i_5-2-rgb_front if you pull on it like this it will stay up if they are dehydrated and that tells you that something is going on
c4az5nstt7i_6-2-rgb_front hiding is another symptom
c4az5nstt7i_7-2-rgb_front they are trying to hide their illness so they try to hide their whole selves
c4az5nstt7i_8-2-rgb_front fortunately we have some tools that can help us as well
c4az5nstt7i_9-2-rgb_front if your cat is getting a little bit older you might want to consider using a diagnostic litter periodically just as a routine check to make sure that the cat is not ill
c4clox0z9aa_1-8-rgb_front myth number you are supposed to use your dog is name before you give him every command to get his attention
c4clox0z9aa_10-8-rgb_front eventually they can add lucky come the dog starts moving over
c4clox0z9aa_11-8-rgb_front if your dog is sitting there and you say lucky down he may towards you and then you may get mad at him
c4clox0z9aa_12-8-rgb_front now he is really confused or lucky stay
c4clox0z9aa_13-8-rgb_front so all that does is cause confusion
c4clox0z9aa_14-8-rgb_front sit down and stay
c4clox0z9aa_15-8-rgb_front those are the stationary commands
c4clox0z9aa_16-8-rgb_front never use the dog is name for those
c4clox0z9aa_2-8-rgb_front wrong
c4clox0z9aa_3-8-rgb_front use your dog is name for common heel
c4clox0z9aa_4-8-rgb_front those are the action commands
c4clox0z9aa_5-8-rgb_front the stationary commands are sit down and stay
c4clox0z9aa_6-8-rgb_front you never want to use your dog is name for those commands
c4clox0z9aa_7-8-rgb_front first thing people do when they bring their puppy or dog home is that they name them
c4clox0z9aa_8-8-rgb_front they will say lucky
c4clox0z9aa_9-8-rgb_front the dog will start moving towards him
c55ch96jxyg_1-8-rgb_front i am charles connelly
c55ch96jxyg_10-8-rgb_front if you have a hard ceiling at the very top about feet from the peak
c55ch96jxyg_11-8-rgb_front the reason we put smoke detectors up high is because smoke and heat rises and this is what is going to set the detector off
c55ch96jxyg_12-8-rgb_front like we said in this case this is a smoke and carbon monoxide detector
c55ch96jxyg_13-8-rgb_front you can get a carbon monoxide at any home depot
c55ch96jxyg_14-8-rgb_front they come in a variety of ways such as ones that can plug into the wall
c55ch96jxyg_15-8-rgb_front smoke detectors should be checked monthly and every smoke detector has a test button
c55ch96jxyg_16-8-rgb_front in this case it is towards the back
c55ch96jxyg_17-8-rgb_front in this practice we are not going to set this one off because we are in an enclosed area and it is very loud
c55ch96jxyg_18-8-rgb_front batteries should be changed in all smoke detectors twice a year
c55ch96jxyg_19-8-rgb_front it is recommended in good practice to change the batteries when you change your clocks for daylight savings time once in the fall and once in the spring
c55ch96jxyg_3-8-rgb_front this is basic fire safety
c55ch96jxyg_4-8-rgb_front this is smoke detectors
c55ch96jxyg_5-8-rgb_front in this case what we have here is combination detectors
c55ch96jxyg_6-8-rgb_front this is a smoke and carbon monoxide detector
c55ch96jxyg_7-8-rgb_front we recommend that everyone has a smoke detector in their house
c55ch96jxyg_8-8-rgb_front it should be placed in the hallways and other common areas and should be in front of bedroom doors
c55ch96jxyg_9-8-rgb_front smoke detectors should be at the highest point of the house such as the top of the ceiling
c5slsqzzdf4_1-3-rgb_front we are talking about how to take care of your wig
c5slsqzzdf4_2-3-rgb_front in previously we have mentioned washing it and felling up a sink or a basin filled or water
c5slsqzzdf4_3-3-rgb_front once you have done that you want to get some wig shampoo
c5slsqzzdf4_4-3-rgb_front it is especially designed to help condition and wash the fiber so it does not break it down as normal shampoo would
c5slsqzzdf4_5-3-rgb_front so you want to go to either the accessory shop or to any of your local wig store to purchase a shampoo specifically made for wig or for wigs so it would help the synthetic hair
c5slsqzzdf4_6-3-rgb_front you want to use probably just about a tablespoon of shampoo in the basin or sink
c5slsqzzdf4_7-3-rgb_front you do not want too much shampoo cause you do not want to have soapy hair so just a little bit would work
c5slsqzzdf4_8-3-rgb_front we would wash out all the dirt and the grime and make it nice and clean for you again
c6difzhesqq_1-8-rgb_front now we are going to talk about how you write dialogue on the page in the formatting process
c6difzhesqq_10-8-rgb_front evan says yes thank you and then evan enters
c6difzhesqq_11-8-rgb_front so here is a way we can break up the dialogue with action and we can list the dialogue
c6difzhesqq_12-8-rgb_front also down on this line sonia says have a seat
c6difzhesqq_13-8-rgb_front evan sits
c6difzhesqq_14-8-rgb_front so we can have evan sit right there and that gives a little direction inside the dialogue
c6difzhesqq_15-8-rgb_front you can also say have a seat
c6difzhesqq_16-8-rgb_front sonia sighs perhaps and that gives a little direction that something she might do in a sound type of capacity but with the dialogue
c6difzhesqq_17-8-rgb_front do you want coffee
c6difzhesqq_18-8-rgb_front do you want a cup
c6difzhesqq_19-8-rgb_front and then he says sure and then she exits
c6difzhesqq_2-8-rgb_front so here we have the same page where we have the scene description and let is look at the dialogue
c6difzhesqq_20-8-rgb_front and then right down here we have offstage which is denoted by the os in parenthesis
c6difzhesqq_21-8-rgb_front that basically means offstage the character is delivering a line from offstage
c6difzhesqq_22-8-rgb_front how do you take it
c6difzhesqq_23-8-rgb_front and then evan says black
c6difzhesqq_24-8-rgb_front and then we hear some dialogue offstage
c6difzhesqq_25-8-rgb_front so here is some of the ways in which we can see dialogue is written on the page
c6difzhesqq_26-8-rgb_front it is basically written in a back and forth process
c6difzhesqq_27-8-rgb_front also there is a lot of room on this page
c6difzhesqq_28-8-rgb_front some of these things will be happening here so that is how the dialogue functions and that is how we lay it out in the page in the formatting of dialogue
c6difzhesqq_3_4-8-rgb_front okay so we have two characters evan and sonia evan says hi sonia says hey and then we come in for a pause
c6difzhesqq_5-8-rgb_front so here is some of the ways in which we can influence dialogue
c6difzhesqq_6-8-rgb_front hi hey pause
c6difzhesqq_7-8-rgb_front so there we have a pause in the dialogue
c6difzhesqq_8-8-rgb_front that is a direction to the actors
c6difzhesqq_9-8-rgb_front then we have sonia saying do you want to come in
c7sx43yu__u_0-8-rgb_front okay we are over here at tub number where we are going to install a pvc pipe drainage system and this pipe does not have any holes in it
c7sx43yu__u_1-8-rgb_front you can buy a pipe that is perforated cause this is a thin wall sewer type pipe
c7sx43yu__u_10-8-rgb_front now we are going to plug the ends of this pipe so that we do not have dirt coming in to the pipes
c7sx43yu__u_11-8-rgb_front on the ends we are just going to use a can to put in the end and we are going to hold it in place with a little piece of stick
c7sx43yu__u_12-8-rgb_front we are going to do that on both ends of the pipe to provide a barrier for the infiltration of dirt that will choke up our drainage system like that
c7sx43yu__u_2-8-rgb_front but the problem is with a thin wall sewer pipe that you will buy it is going to have holes on exactly sides of each other and we are not going to drill like that
c7sx43yu__u_3-8-rgb_front we are going to drill our holes so that the water holes are on the bottom of the pipe but not degrees to each other
c7sx43yu__u_4-8-rgb_front we are going to drill them so that they are just kind of around the corner from each other
c7sx43yu__u_5-8-rgb_front then we will give an improved way of getting the water out while impeding the infiltration of dirt and many things that will get into there to choke up our little system
c7sx43yu__u_6-8-rgb_front these holes are about a half inch diameter
c7sx43yu__u_7-8-rgb_front this is a speed borer
c7sx43yu__u_8-8-rgb_front it is kind of a generic name that is used for the drill bit or flat spade bit that some people call them
c7sx43yu__u_9-8-rgb_front that does a real nice job of drilling but you can see how we drill primarily on one side of the pipe and there is a reason for that
c8qcebslaow_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to learn the lift up with your second hand
c8qcebslaow_1-8-rgb_front if you hoop to the left your second hand is your left hand
c8qcebslaow_10-8-rgb_front really try to push the hoop forward and keep it in that strong horizontal plane above your head
c8qcebslaow_11-8-rgb_front let is try it again
c8qcebslaow_12-8-rgb_front take the hoop to the waist start hooping in your comfortable direction take the second hand notice when the hoops create an opening in front of your body
c8qcebslaow_13-8-rgb_front hands dips into the hoop like you are shaking someone is hand lift and turn
c8qcebslaow_14-8-rgb_front bring the hoop up into lasso
c8qcebslaow_15-8-rgb_front turning is really important in this move
c8qcebslaow_16-8-rgb_front one more time
c8qcebslaow_17-8-rgb_front hooping at the waist dipping the hand in turning spiraling all the way up into lasso with the second hand
c8qcebslaow_18-8-rgb_front nice job
c8qcebslaow_2-8-rgb_front if you hoop to the right your second hand is your right hand
c8qcebslaow_3-8-rgb_front starting at the waist look down watch the hoop
c8qcebslaow_4-8-rgb_front as the hoop swings around to the front of your body you are going to take your second hand dip it in the hoop grab the hoop as if you are shaking someone is hand turn with the hoop and lift it up
c8qcebslaow_5-8-rgb_front let is get a little bit more detailed
c8qcebslaow_6-8-rgb_front at the waist your second hand dips into the hoop grab the hoop and lift it up all the way up into lasso over the head
c8qcebslaow_7-8-rgb_front there is one tricky movement that happens with the hand
c8qcebslaow_8-8-rgb_front as you lift up the hoop is going to roll over your thumb and into the palm of your hand
c8qcebslaow_9-8-rgb_front it is a little bit tricky
cbqbvdzqx3g_0-8-rgb_front my name is joseph shung chiang lee
cbqbvdzqx3g_1-8-rgb_front i am a member of the calcutta racing pigeon club
cbqbvdzqx3g_10-8-rgb_front so once this pigeon has grown to become an adult pigeon you cannot remove the ring
cbqbvdzqx3g_11-8-rgb_front neither you can put on any other ring
cbqbvdzqx3g_12-8-rgb_front so this number belongs to this pigeon it cannot be changed
cbqbvdzqx3g_2-8-rgb_front this ring that you can see is not made in india
cbqbvdzqx3g_3-8-rgb_front they are imported from belgium
cbqbvdzqx3g_4-8-rgb_front we import the ring from belgium to prevent anyone from duplicating the ring
cbqbvdzqx3g_5-8-rgb_front so this is why any people are making the same number of rings
cbqbvdzqx3g_6-8-rgb_front so this ring is made with aluminum metal ring and the people would just bring the number and the club name and the year and then covered with plastic
cbqbvdzqx3g_7-8-rgb_front now this ring is released from the club but ring is given from the club only after december and the ring you have to put on the ring on the youngster when they are only about days old
cbqbvdzqx3g_8-8-rgb_front more than days old then the leg will become sore and it would be difficult to put the ring in
cbqbvdzqx3g_9-8-rgb_front this pigeon is about more than weeks old and you can see it is impossible to take out the ring or to put in another ring without injuring the leg of the bird
cc-miiph-14_0-8-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson
cc-miiph-14_1-8-rgb_front what we want to talk about right now is the importance of having a good rebounding team
cc-miiph-14_2-8-rgb_front now in the game of basketball every possession counts and what a rebound means is another chance for your team to either score or less of a chance for the opposing team to get a chance to score
cc-miiph-14_3-8-rgb_front rebounding is probably one of the most important parts fundamental parts of the game of basketball
cc-miiph-14_4-8-rgb_front if you have a good rebounding team not only will your team get many chances at the basket but also the opposing team every time they miss it and you get to rebound you will be able to go to the other end and score and that is what we all like to do is to go to the other end and score
cc-miiph-14_5-8-rgb_front so it is very important that each one of your players takes pride in rebounding and that you instill that in your practices and that you work on the fundamental skills of rebounding so that your team is able to get second chance shots and so that you can dominate inside and so that you can keep the other team off the boards and allow your team to score more
cc-miiph-14_6-8-rgb_front really concentrate on rebounding it will make your team much much better
cc5rfhob1gk_0-5-rgb_front you have recently wondered what are your rights about free credit report
cc5rfhob1gk_1-5-rgb_front are you entitled to a free credit report
cc5rfhob1gk_2-5-rgb_front whatever
cc5rfhob1gk_3-5-rgb_front hello i am robert todd and i am here to answer what is the law about free credit reports
cc5rfhob1gk_4-5-rgb_front as you know employers often and are allowed by law to check your credit report for their background checks for you with regards to both perspective employment and with existing employment
cc5rfhob1gk_5-5-rgb_front the united states fair credit reporting act entitles you as an individual to receive a free credit report once a year
cc5rfhob1gk_6-5-rgb_front now there are a lot of websites that talk about sending you the free credit report and so forth beware
cc5rfhob1gk_7-5-rgb_front instead i would site you to annual credit report dot com to receive your free credit report
cc5rfhob1gk_8-5-rgb_front and pay attention to your credit report it is probably not a bad idea to check on this once a year
cc5rfhob1gk_9-5-rgb_front i am robert todd and thank you for watching
cemmjobvnze_0-5-rgb_front okay let is talk for a minute about structure
cemmjobvnze_1-5-rgb_front that is what i am going to call it
cemmjobvnze_10-5-rgb_front traditionally a monologue should have a climax
cemmjobvnze_11-5-rgb_front and what a climax is is where the character makes a revelation
cemmjobvnze_12-5-rgb_front throws somebody out
cemmjobvnze_13-5-rgb_front some big action occurs that they have been talking about prior to it
cemmjobvnze_14-5-rgb_front so think of the monologue structure as kind of an arc
cemmjobvnze_15-5-rgb_front we are building to something that big something happens and then we can taper it down
cemmjobvnze_16-5-rgb_front also remember you only have one or two minutes to get the job
cemmjobvnze_17-5-rgb_front to make the impression
cemmjobvnze_18-5-rgb_front to be fabulous
cemmjobvnze_19-5-rgb_front so always always pick a monologue with a strong opening line
cemmjobvnze_2-5-rgb_front but what we are looking at is what needs to be in this one or two minutes with regards to material
cemmjobvnze_20-5-rgb_front many monologues are more talking about something just chatting
cemmjobvnze_21-5-rgb_front and that is okay
cemmjobvnze_22-5-rgb_front but you must have a strong opening line and really you need a strong closing line
cemmjobvnze_23_24_25-5-rgb_front but that is not the closing is not absolutely as imperative as the opening line you want a stong opening hey listen to me
cemmjobvnze_26-5-rgb_front i am going to do a monologue
cemmjobvnze_27-5-rgb_front and then your closing the thing about the closing the last line it should be very clear i am done
cemmjobvnze_28-5-rgb_front i have seen way too many monologues that just kind of ended
cemmjobvnze_29-5-rgb_front and left me the director wanting more
cemmjobvnze_3-5-rgb_front well regardless of where you find the monologue if you put it together or even if you write it yourself it is important that the monologue makes sense
cemmjobvnze_30-5-rgb_front okay that was it
cemmjobvnze_31-5-rgb_front you never want to say okay i am finished
cemmjobvnze_32-5-rgb_front you want to come in with that strong line
cemmjobvnze_33-5-rgb_front so that is what we got to have in this monologue
cemmjobvnze_4-5-rgb_front do not think necessarily so much in the terms of beginning middle and end
cemmjobvnze_5-5-rgb_front but where are we going
cemmjobvnze_6-5-rgb_front what is the through line of the character
cemmjobvnze_7-5-rgb_front what is the character talking about
cemmjobvnze_8-5-rgb_front why are they talking about it
cemmjobvnze_9-5-rgb_front where is this monologue going
cg6jfsmdpnw_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to go over some measuring rules
cg6jfsmdpnw_1-8-rgb_front this is called an eyebrow map
cg6jfsmdpnw_10-8-rgb_front if your eyebrow ends short of that naturally then that is fine do not make it any shorter but you want to let that your fine fine few hairs end up that is a natural line that is your map
cg6jfsmdpnw_11-8-rgb_front ok
cg6jfsmdpnw_12-8-rgb_front so i have got my inside starting my outside ending now your arch right in the middle of your eyebrow is where your arch should be the highest point of your eyebrow
cg6jfsmdpnw_13-8-rgb_front when you are looking straight forward where the pupil of your eye is go ahead and open your eye where the pupil of her eye is i want to hold this straight up above and that is where the highest part of her arch is going to be
cg6jfsmdpnw_14-8-rgb_front so now i have created that is all natural lines no matter what your face shape is
cg6jfsmdpnw_15-8-rgb_front so now i have actually created an eyebrow map
cg6jfsmdpnw_16-8-rgb_front now that i know the shape that i need to take i am going to kind of embed this in my memory in my brain or if you need to remeasure as you go along that is fine
cg6jfsmdpnw_17-8-rgb_front so now i know where the shape that i want her eyebrows to be
cg6jfsmdpnw_2-8-rgb_front ok
cg6jfsmdpnw_3-8-rgb_front it is called a shaping map
cg6jfsmdpnw_4-8-rgb_front a couple of things you want to learn
cg6jfsmdpnw_5-8-rgb_front first of all just take your stick or even your eyebrow brush something with a straight line and what you want to do is measure from the inside of the nose i mean excuse me the outside of the nose hold the stick straight up
cg6jfsmdpnw_6-8-rgb_front you are drawing imaginary lines ok
cg6jfsmdpnw_7-8-rgb_front that is where the inside of her eyebrow is going to start right here where this line is
cg6jfsmdpnw_8-8-rgb_front that is the inside of her eyebrow which is where it is naturally so that is good
cg6jfsmdpnw_9-8-rgb_front then you want to take the same space from her nose and draw an imaginary line again follow it to the outside corner of her eye and that is where the outside of her eyebrow will end
ch27piyx6gi_0-9-rgb_front so are you interested on how to brush your teeth
ch27piyx6gi_1-9-rgb_front well my name is michelle and i am a dental assistant with solutionz and i am going to explain and show you on how you can brush your teeth
ch27piyx6gi_10-9-rgb_front you are going to want to initially first angle the bristles directly at like somewhat of like a ninety degree angle and you are going to place it therefore the bristles are touching your gums and your teeth and then you want to go around in a circular motion
ch27piyx6gi_11-9-rgb_front what you do not want to do is go back and forth or go up like this because that will actually cause your gums to kind of swell if you are going back and forth and it will also cause your gums to recede and then you will start to become having sensitive teeth so you want to go in a circular motion
ch27piyx6gi_12-9-rgb_front that will ensure that you are removing all of the debris and bacteria off of your teeth and then you want to start in the front and work your way towards the back and then go ahead and open for me slightly sweetie and then when you are coming back towards your back teeth it is always helpful that you close down just a bit so therefore it will release your tmj joint muscle to give you more room to brush back there in a circular motion so go ahead and close down for me
ch27piyx6gi_13-9-rgb_front there you go just like that and as you can see i am able to stick the toothbrush way back there and you are making sure you are getting the very back part of your teeth along with your gums and you want to do that consistently all throughout your mouth
ch27piyx6gi_14-9-rgb_front you want to do it on your upper arch and also on your lower arch
ch27piyx6gi_15-9-rgb_front that will remove any of debris and bacteria from your gums and then also you want to brush back and forth motion on top of your teeth and that will remove any debris and prevent you from having any cavities and my name is michelle and i am a dental assistant with solutionz and i just demonstrated for you on how to brush your teeth
ch27piyx6gi_2_3_4_5-9-rgb_front we have a great girl she is going to demonstrate for us on how to brush your teeth it is pretty simple first of all you need the set of teeth and you need a toothbrush and a toothpaste you want to place a small amount of toothpaste on to your toothbrush
ch27piyx6gi_6-9-rgb_front just basically you want to cover the bristles of your toothbrush
ch27piyx6gi_7-9-rgb_front then you are going to go ahead and open for me and actually bite down on your back teeth
ch27piyx6gi_8-9-rgb_front back teeth bite down like this
ch27piyx6gi_9-9-rgb_front good just like that
ch9sbtbbeey_0-8-rgb_front hi i am john graden for the martial arts teacher is association
ch9sbtbbeey_1-8-rgb_front as a fighter and as a coach here are two offensive strategies that once you learn to understand that everything falls into place and quite simply it is a direct attack versus an indirect attack
ch9sbtbbeey_10-8-rgb_front if i go direct he is going to clock me as i come in and i do not want that to happen so i go about it indirectly
ch9sbtbbeey_11-8-rgb_front i will throw a little fake on him draw that punch out and then finish the attack by stepping in the rest of the distance so it is an indirect attack
ch9sbtbbeey_12-8-rgb_front so a direct attack nothing proceeds it and an indirect attack is usually proceeded by a fake or some kind of draw step or something that sets the attack up
ch9sbtbbeey_13-8-rgb_front you want to hit him with the punch or the kick but because of their counter fighting skills or speed or power you will want to go about it indirectly
ch9sbtbbeey_14-8-rgb_front so become a master at direct attacks and indirect attacks and when to use each
ch9sbtbbeey_15-8-rgb_front i am john graden
ch9sbtbbeey_16-8-rgb_front for more information contact me at johngraden com
ch9sbtbbeey_17-8-rgb_front thank you
ch9sbtbbeey_2-8-rgb_front you want to become a master of both but the real intricacy the real advanced student really becomes a master at the indirect attack
ch9sbtbbeey_3-8-rgb_front what do i mean by this
ch9sbtbbeey_4-8-rgb_front joining me from pro star mixed martial arts is mr joe brignoli
ch9sbtbbeey_5-8-rgb_front a direct attack just like it implies i am out where i set point control without a fake without anything else i simply step in pow and i directly attack him
ch9sbtbbeey_6-8-rgb_front that is fine however if he is bigger stronger faster more experienced than me stepping in with a direct attack could be kind of dangerous especially if he is a really good counter fighter
ch9sbtbbeey_7-8-rgb_front so i want to become a master of the indirect attack so possibly in this case i am going to throw a little fake on him
ch9sbtbbeey_8-8-rgb_front in other words i am going to hit him with this jab but i am going to go about it indirectly
ch9sbtbbeey_9-8-rgb_front so i might i have got this much distance to cover in order to get in there
ckw0ifadisu_0-3-rgb_front hi
ckw0ifadisu_10-3-rgb_front again we are just going to do it on a series of little cuts
ckw0ifadisu_11-3-rgb_front pretty soon it will just go right through and i will have my cardboard protecting the carpet area
ckw0ifadisu_12-3-rgb_front you can start to feel when it has gone all the way through your picture or through the foam core
ckw0ifadisu_2-3-rgb_front again if you are brand new at this just start with something small and kind of get a feel for it before you do something much larger
ckw0ifadisu_3-3-rgb_front if you do not want the ruler touching the photo like i did this the first and second times
ckw0ifadisu_4-3-rgb_front part of the ruler is actually on the photo but if you do not want that to be on the photo at all then go ahead and keep it on the outside and just line it up on your photo like this
ckw0ifadisu_5-3-rgb_front again make sure that you kind of stretch out a little bit because you will be on the floor cutting for quite a bit
ckw0ifadisu_6-3-rgb_front if you have a nice large table to use
ckw0ifadisu_7-3-rgb_front you need to be able to press down which is why i like doing it on the floor
ckw0ifadisu_8-3-rgb_front i have that gravity working for me and i can press down
ckw0ifadisu_9-3-rgb_front again we are going to go ahead and score this at the very top
ckmtmtqeuki_0-9-rgb_front hi on behalf of expertvillag com my name is shelly roberts with aa callister in salt lake city utah i am going to show you some points about how to do buy a winter horse blanket
ckmtmtqeuki_1-9-rgb_front fist i would like to show you what a winter horse blanket is
ckmtmtqeuki_2-9-rgb_front it is a body cover that will usually cover from their chest back to their tail and this is rudy here
ckmtmtqeuki_3-9-rgb_front rudy also has on a hood and we will go into hoods a little later but just a winter horse blanket something to protect your horse from the elements
ckmtmtqeuki_4-9-rgb_front now some people might say why does my horse need a winter horse blanket
ckmtmtqeuki_5-9-rgb_front horses have been around for thousands of years and it is true mother nature has provided them with a layer of head that will protect them from the elements
ckmtmtqeuki_6-9-rgb_front but as we have domesticated horses we have taken them out of their natural environment and put them in places that they would not naturally be like in a snow covered pasture up to feet where they can not get any food vegetation
ckmtmtqeuki_7-9-rgb_front so we have had to get horse blankets to provide them with the natural covering that they would need in that environment that mother nature has not provide for them
ckmtmtqeuki_8-9-rgb_front so we will go over what a horse blanket is types of horse blankets there are what sizes there are and how to size your horse for the winter horse blanket
ckmtmtqeuki_9-9-rgb_front so that is how to start choosing a horse blanket a winter horse blanket
cn11vmtiguw_0-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that you always apply your wax in the same direction the hair grows
cn11vmtiguw_1-8-rgb_front the hair will not be removed with the wax if you do not do it in this manner
cn11vmtiguw_10-8-rgb_front perfect
cn11vmtiguw_11-8-rgb_front this is a good little secret tip
cn11vmtiguw_12-8-rgb_front if you have wax that you have previously removed take that and reapply it to the wax the next section that you are ready to take off because it gives you like a handle something to grab a hold of and remove that wax
cn11vmtiguw_13-8-rgb_front wax sticks to wax so you can go through and dab that on any little pieces that might be left and remove those wax
cn11vmtiguw_14-8-rgb_front so remember apply with the growth remove against the growth
cn11vmtiguw_2-8-rgb_front so i am going the hair grows down and it is sometimes facial hair tends to grow in several directions
cn11vmtiguw_3-8-rgb_front so if this hair grows in the direction then go this way
cn11vmtiguw_4-8-rgb_front if this hair grows in this direction then go that way and separate your sections
cn11vmtiguw_5-8-rgb_front but make sure you always apply in the way the hair grows in the direction the hair is growing
cn11vmtiguw_6-8-rgb_front it is growing this way i am applying this way
cn11vmtiguw_7-8-rgb_front hard wax
cn11vmtiguw_8-8-rgb_front remember we are going to put it on nice and thick so we have something to grab a hold of
cn11vmtiguw_9-8-rgb_front and then i am going to remove against the direction of the hair growth
cnlpx_e0_kk_1-5-rgb_front and today we are going to talk about how to self publish your own comic or graphic novel
cnlpx_e0_kk_10-5-rgb_front you know here we have had four pages in a row that are captioned
cnlpx_e0_kk_11-5-rgb_front you would rarely if ever see in a movie where there would have that much voice over time
cnlpx_e0_kk_12-5-rgb_front comics are also a literary medium
cnlpx_e0_kk_13-5-rgb_front you are not doing an inferior job as a comic storyteller to use that and to allow yourself to get inside the comic character is head
cnlpx_e0_kk_2-5-rgb_front so are comics really like movies
cnlpx_e0_kk_3-5-rgb_front obviously there have been any number of successful comic movies lately and they certainly have some things in common
cnlpx_e0_kk_4-5-rgb_front comics are a visual medium and movies tend to be a visual medium as well
cnlpx_e0_kk_5-5-rgb_front although as we said with comics you have an unlimited special effects budget
cnlpx_e0_kk_6-5-rgb_front but the thing to remember about comics is that they are also a literary medium
cnlpx_e0_kk_7-5-rgb_front with comics you have time and you can control the pacing
cnlpx_e0_kk_8-5-rgb_front it is it is not like a movie where you are you are paying for every single minute
cnlpx_e0_kk_9-5-rgb_front and if you want to do a voice over and include captions that is fairly easy to do
cnlldjjcrig_0-5-rgb_front another thing to look out for and this can be very important
cnlldjjcrig_1-5-rgb_front quite often hats have inner tags and even though the lining on this particular this is a canvas hat a safari hat with a snap on the side as you will see even though this hat is lined with a gentle cotton that would find very good on your head it actually has a harsh embroidered tag on the back of it that can be very very uncomfortable
cnlldjjcrig_2-5-rgb_front look out for tags bows seams and joins because while they might not feel bad during the three seconds during the time you are in the hat shop once that hat is on your head for four or five or six hours they can begin to chaff wear and become a complete annoyance and now you have spent or on a hat you are not going to wear any more and that is just not good sense
coqgnuyjzyw_0-8-rgb_front hi
coqgnuyjzyw_10-8-rgb_front for example if our cheer is go go go team go
coqgnuyjzyw_11-8-rgb_front the most prominent and easy words of that cheer are going to be go team go
coqgnuyjzyw_12-8-rgb_front we are going to want to start off with go team go and then everyone knows what cheer we are going to do you are going to be ready and you are going to take one beat to get into the cheer
coqgnuyjzyw_13-8-rgb_front anyone can call a cheer at anytime
coqgnuyjzyw_14-8-rgb_front first and foremost you usually want to let the captain go ahead and call a couple of cheers
coqgnuyjzyw_15-8-rgb_front then each girl is going to take a turn
coqgnuyjzyw_16-8-rgb_front sometimes we will go in order down the formation
coqgnuyjzyw_17-8-rgb_front other times it can just be a free fall
coqgnuyjzyw_18-8-rgb_front whenever you feel the motivation to start your cheer you are going want to make sure everyone is paying attention
coqgnuyjzyw_19-8-rgb_front go ahead and this is where our volume is going to come into play
coqgnuyjzyw_2-8-rgb_front i am going to show you some cheerleading squad cheers today
coqgnuyjzyw_20-8-rgb_front just make sure everyone is ready
coqgnuyjzyw_21-8-rgb_front you are in control of saying go team go
coqgnuyjzyw_22-8-rgb_front then everyone should be ready to go ahead and go forth to perform the whole cheer
coqgnuyjzyw_3-8-rgb_front we are going to talk about chants and i am going to demonstrate some that you can take to your squad
coqgnuyjzyw_4-8-rgb_front now that we are at a game we need to figure how we are going to do what cheer when
coqgnuyjzyw_5-8-rgb_front we do not just want to do them in the same order every game because then it is going to get boring
coqgnuyjzyw_6-8-rgb_front the crowd is going to get sick of it
coqgnuyjzyw_7-8-rgb_front we are going to get sick of it and also how are we going to know when to start these cheers
coqgnuyjzyw_8-8-rgb_front it is really important to learn how to call a cheer
coqgnuyjzyw_9-8-rgb_front the way we are going to call a cheer is to pick out the most prominent words and motions of the cheer
coukk2pnilc_1-5-rgb_front if the cake happens to fall in you can just flip it over and use the bottom side to frost
coukk2pnilc_2-5-rgb_front the cake could fall if you do not modify the recipe for high altitudes or if you open the oven to much and cool air will cause it to fall
coukk2pnilc_3-5-rgb_front the timer just went off we are going to check the cakes and i am going to stick this knife down in the center and it came out clean
coukk2pnilc_4-5-rgb_front there is no batter on it so now we are going to take the cake out when you cooling the cakes it is important not to cool it on the oven
coukk2pnilc_5-5-rgb_front so you suppose to put them on cooling racks so that they can cool but i do not have cooling racks so i am just going to use this pan turn it upside down and cool them that way
cp4zkvuikge_0-9-rgb_front hi i am stan defreitas mr green thumb
cp4zkvuikge_1-9-rgb_front this is a is tongue sometimes called sansevieria
cp4zkvuikge_10-9-rgb_front as far as the plant goes it grows well in a good peaty type soil but you can grow it in just about anything sand rocky it does not matter
cp4zkvuikge_11-9-rgb_front this plant will survive
cp4zkvuikge_12-9-rgb_front this plant can be grown inside in a bright area or even a low lit area
cp4zkvuikge_13-9-rgb_front the plant still seems to survive
cp4zkvuikge_14-9-rgb_front good water soluble plant food maybe once every two to three months should be fine or you can add some extra fertilizer at planting time
cp4zkvuikge_15-9-rgb_front sansevieria good plant if you are trying to make sure the plant will not die
cp4zkvuikge_16-9-rgb_front for on gardening i am stan defreitas mr green thumb
cp4zkvuikge_2-9-rgb_front and the is tongue well you kind of get the idea where the name came from
cp4zkvuikge_3-9-rgb_front it looks like a long tongue
cp4zkvuikge_4-9-rgb_front this plant is one of those succulent kind of plants that is really tough
cp4zkvuikge_5-9-rgb_front this is almost a brown thumber is favorite plant
cp4zkvuikge_6-9-rgb_front you really have to try to kill this plant once it is established
cp4zkvuikge_7-9-rgb_front probably not that cold hardy but this plant sometimes called say is tongue or it used to be called hemp plant as well
cp4zkvuikge_8-9-rgb_front they used to grow this plant and they would actually peel the leaves and make a type of hemp rope from it also
cp4zkvuikge_9-9-rgb_front a little trivia that you may not have known
cpii6gpjvgu_1-3-rgb_front now that we have our dough we will set that to the side and i will show you how to make the orange zest that we will need next
cpii6gpjvgu_2-3-rgb_front all you need to do is take a small grater and with your orange grate until you have cup
cpii6gpjvgu_3-3-rgb_front keep rotating your orange so you do not actually get into the fruit part we just want the rind
cpii6gpjvgu_4-3-rgb_front it does take a little while alright we final have our cup of orange zest we are now going to add this to the rest of our dough
cqbrxccfdyc_0-5-rgb_front hi i am magician paul weatherbee and i am going to show you a magic trick
cqbrxccfdyc_1-5-rgb_front i am going to need to borrow a dollar from a spectator
cqbrxccfdyc_10-5-rgb_front very good
cqbrxccfdyc_11-5-rgb_front right there
cqbrxccfdyc_12-5-rgb_front you can see it there
cqbrxccfdyc_13-5-rgb_front okay i am going to take your dollar bill
cqbrxccfdyc_14-5-rgb_front i am going to cover it up with this handkerchief and better yet what we will do is grab it right by the top here
cqbrxccfdyc_15-5-rgb_front can you feel it in there
cqbrxccfdyc_16-5-rgb_front can you hold it
cqbrxccfdyc_17-5-rgb_front you got a hold of it
cqbrxccfdyc_18-5-rgb_front okay very good
cqbrxccfdyc_19-5-rgb_front now i have got a magic magic knife right here new york style credit card
cqbrxccfdyc_2-5-rgb_front sir could you please come on up with your dollar
cqbrxccfdyc_20-5-rgb_front we will tap once here and tap once here
cqbrxccfdyc_21-5-rgb_front when i count to three let go
cqbrxccfdyc_22-5-rgb_front are you ready
cqbrxccfdyc_23-5-rgb_front one two three and the dollar is gone
cqbrxccfdyc_24-5-rgb_front where could it be you might ask
cqbrxccfdyc_25-5-rgb_front well we have an orange right here
cqbrxccfdyc_26-5-rgb_front just take a look at this
cqbrxccfdyc_27-5-rgb_front cut that right around there like that
cqbrxccfdyc_28-5-rgb_front there is the dollar in the orange
cqbrxccfdyc_29-5-rgb_front here is the serial number
cqbrxccfdyc_3-5-rgb_front there it is very good
cqbrxccfdyc_30-5-rgb_front take the dollar out of the orange and make sure that the serial number matches
cqbrxccfdyc_31-5-rgb_front does it match
cqbrxccfdyc_32-5-rgb_front it does
cqbrxccfdyc_33-5-rgb_front there you have it
cqbrxccfdyc_34-5-rgb_front now i am going to tell you how this trick is done
cqbrxccfdyc_35-5-rgb_front first you get an orange and you cut the end off the orange
cqbrxccfdyc_36-5-rgb_front you stick a pencil in the orange and then you roll up a dollar bill
cqbrxccfdyc_37-5-rgb_front before you roll it up write down the serial number
cqbrxccfdyc_38-5-rgb_front and then you stick it into the orange and put the little knob back on
cqbrxccfdyc_39-5-rgb_front in the cloth i have a piece of rolled up paper sewn in the hem
cqbrxccfdyc_4-5-rgb_front ah yes
cqbrxccfdyc_40-5-rgb_front that way when the person is holding it they think it is really the dollar
cqbrxccfdyc_41-5-rgb_front so when i write down the serial number of their dollar i have already written this down and i just act like i am writing this down
cqbrxccfdyc_42-5-rgb_front so they give me the dollar in my hand
cqbrxccfdyc_43-5-rgb_front i take their dollar as i am reaching for the knife and put it in my pocket then give them this wadded up piece of paper to hold
cqbrxccfdyc_44-5-rgb_front and then the rest is just cutting open the orange to reveal the dollar
cqbrxccfdyc_45-5-rgb_front have fun and keep the magic in your life
cqbrxccfdyc_5-5-rgb_front i am going to write down the serial number of that dollar because as you know each dollar has a separate serial number
cqbrxccfdyc_6-5-rgb_front that is the way they can be identified later
cqbrxccfdyc_7-5-rgb_front okay i would like you to take your dollar bill and roll it up if you would
cqbrxccfdyc_8-5-rgb_front just roll it right up and place it into my left hand
cqbrxccfdyc_9-5-rgb_front roll it right up tight
cqwxm1k62wy_0-5-rgb_front hi this is yolanda vanveen from vanveen bulbs dot com
cqwxm1k62wy_1-5-rgb_front and in this segment we are going to talk about how to grow indoor plants with artificial lights
cqwxm1k62wy_10-5-rgb_front and it seems to be just enough for them to do even better then if they did not get any light at night
cqwxm1k62wy_11-5-rgb_front and i found just a little bit of artificial light goes a long way
cqwxm1k62wy_12-5-rgb_front and all it takes whether it is a little light in your laundry room or a light in your bathroom or even a light in your office
cqwxm1k62wy_13-5-rgb_front if you put a plant underneath that light when the light is on at night it might be just enough for that plant to do really well
cqwxm1k62wy_14_15-5-rgb_front so of course the sun light is the best for plants but not all of us live in areas where even when the sun is out and there is so many clouds to cloud it up you are just not getting enough light in the house
cqwxm1k62wy_16-5-rgb_front so by just even having a few lamps or a few lights or using the lights that you already have sometimes you can use clip on lights and sometimes even a night light over a plant will make all the difference
cqwxm1k62wy_17-5-rgb_front and try it that is what my case is try it you never know what plants will do
cqwxm1k62wy_18-5-rgb_front a lot of plants do not need much light to survive
cqwxm1k62wy_19-5-rgb_front and they will do very well indoors even if it is a tiny night light above them
cqwxm1k62wy_2-5-rgb_front now we all love our plants outside in our garden but we can also enjoy plants inside
cqwxm1k62wy_20-5-rgb_front so try to plant your plants inside under a light and see how they do
cqwxm1k62wy_21-5-rgb_front if they are not doing so well move them into a sunnier window and if they are doing really well then leave them where they are at
cqwxm1k62wy_22-5-rgb_front but gardening can be really enjoyable inside or outside and you do not even need to have sunlight
cqwxm1k62wy_23-5-rgb_front you can have artificial light
cqwxm1k62wy_3-5-rgb_front and you do not need to have a really sunny window and you do not need to have a lot of artificial light for them to grow well
cqwxm1k62wy_4-5-rgb_front you only need a little light and i found plants really survive well indoors with a little help with just a little artificial light
cqwxm1k62wy_5-5-rgb_front i have found this window is the best window in my whole house for plants to grow
cqwxm1k62wy_6-5-rgb_front it is east facing so it gets the sun that comes up in the morning and then there is no sun in the afternoon
cqwxm1k62wy_7-5-rgb_front i have got this artificial light up here that is on every night
cqwxm1k62wy_8-5-rgb_front it is about the only light that i leave on in this part of the house
cqwxm1k62wy_9-5-rgb_front and it is just enough light for all the plants to have light at night as well
crrd3k2zgsc_0-8-rgb_front hi i am tim gipson and i am going to talk to you about how to use steel wool
crrd3k2zgsc_1-8-rgb_front now when we are using steel wool steel wool comes in various coarseness and fineness
crrd3k2zgsc_2-8-rgb_front now you have and they are graded by numbers so you may have a steel wool that is or any numbers like or represent a coarse steel wool and that might be something that you use as far as removing rust from metal using or an oil type of finish so if you have some rough machine parts that you want to clean up using a coarse steel wool
crrd3k2zgsc_3-8-rgb_front then you get into the steel wools that are finer such as a or a or and those are the type of steel wools that you use for something like this is when you are refinishing furniture or putting finishes on furniture
crrd3k2zgsc_4-8-rgb_front what the steel wool allows you to do is get a really smooth surface as opposed to using a fine sand paper so we will use the steel wool so in this case if we have put a coat of varnish or urethane or a shellac on this and we are in between coats then we can use the steel wool
crrd3k2zgsc_5-8-rgb_front now it is usually a good idea to have a neoprene or latex glove or a rubber glove that you are using when you are using steel wool because little shavings can come off and can embed in your skin so it is good to have some kind of protection but when we are using steel wool we are going to use it just like we would any sand paper and we are just going to rub it and we are going to go with the grain so it is very important when you are refinishing wood that you always use any type of sand paper or any type of steel wool you are putting very very fine scratches into the surface so you always want that to go with the grain so that it will not show up
crrd3k2zgsc_6-8-rgb_front so again it works just like using steel wool is just like using sand paper and we can just work back and forth and what it does is it really can give you a very fine surface in between your coats of your urethane shellac or lacquer or polyurethanes
crrd3k2zgsc_7-8-rgb_front so i am tim gipson and that is how to use steel wool
crhaqtxgclw_0-5-rgb_front in our first clip we are going to actually talk about the construction of the mirrors
crhaqtxgclw_1-5-rgb_front they are approximately foot square
crhaqtxgclw_2-5-rgb_front they are unbreakable and one of the reasons being unbreakable is i have the boxers stand about where they can punch the mirror and then step about a half a foot back
crhaqtxgclw_3-5-rgb_front so too many times they will be stepping in and they will be actually hitting the mirror which is really not what we want to do
crhaqtxgclw_4-5-rgb_front but just in case they do we do not want them to break
crhaqtxgclw_5-5-rgb_front the reason we have got them cut down to about a foot square is we used to use a mirror and some of the boxers still use the mirrors in their shadowboxing etcetera but that does not give you the actual circumference of your head of a position
crhaqtxgclw_6-5-rgb_front even with a full length mirror if you take a magic marker and draw a circle around it you will get the effect of a target but this gives you that much more
crhaqtxgclw_7-5-rgb_front once you duck down you are out of the mirror and that is the best thing about having just the foot mirror
crhaqtxgclw_8-5-rgb_front that way you are limited to just that one foot
crhaqtxgclw_9-5-rgb_front once you are out of there you are out of that mirror
crhmpbpcw_4_1-5-rgb_front so we are going to use about an inch of the hot water just enough to let the tea steep
crhmpbpcw_4_2-5-rgb_front there is one tea bag just let the tea steep for a little bit and we are going to fill up this with cold water over the ice so i am going to add the cold water to it so all the ice does not melt
crhmpbpcw_4_3-5-rgb_front and pour it over the ice i usually leave the tea bag in it
crhmpbpcw_4_4-5-rgb_front if you want to add honey or cream you can do that when it is in the hot water so that it will dissolve and that is an iced tea
crhmpbpcw_4_5-5-rgb_front watch our next segment and i will show you how to make another drink
crrkstsuw10_0-2-rgb_front hi my name is mary thinnes and i am a skin care expert
crrkstsuw10_1-2-rgb_front i am going to go through prepping the skin to repair it for the chemical peels
crrkstsuw10_10-2-rgb_front after you have rinsed off the cleanser off the skin you want to prep the skin with the papaya
crrkstsuw10_11-2-rgb_front papaya is going to break down those dead skin cells and its going to help the chemicals penetrate into the skin as well
crrkstsuw10_12-2-rgb_front if you have dead skin cells built up on the surface nothing is going to come in and nothing is going to go out
crrkstsuw10_13-2-rgb_front so it will not be effective
crrkstsuw10_14-2-rgb_front basically papaya is just a little bit of like a gel as you can tell
crrkstsuw10_15-2-rgb_front and you want to put it on the skin
crrkstsuw10_16-2-rgb_front and since most people do not have a steamer at home you want to keep it on the skin for about twenty minutes without steam
crrkstsuw10_17-2-rgb_front if you have a steamer you want to keep it on the skin for ten minutes
crrkstsuw10_18-2-rgb_front but without a steamer you are going to keep it on for twenty
crrkstsuw10_19-2-rgb_front and then once twenty minutes is up you are going to remove it with a wet cloth
crrkstsuw10_2-2-rgb_front first what you want to do is put on gloves to protect your hands because it will cause peeling on your hands
crrkstsuw10_20-2-rgb_front and that is the first step in prepping the skin for chemical peels
crrkstsuw10_3-2-rgb_front and obviously you do not want that
crrkstsuw10_4-2-rgb_front then you are going to cleanse the skin
crrkstsuw10_5-2-rgb_front i am going to take a brush dip it in some water put some of the cleansing gel on it and then i am going to cleanse the skin
crrkstsuw10_6-2-rgb_front you want to do it in just a circular motion
crrkstsuw10_7-2-rgb_front do not be too aggressive on the skin just cleanse it
crrkstsuw10_8-2-rgb_front just making sure you get off all the impurities so that your skin is properly prepped for the peel
crrkstsuw10_9-2-rgb_front and so that the chemicals and treatments that you are going to do from here on out are actually going to penetrate into cleansed skin not contaminated skin
csrzjbw3oty_0-5-rgb_front so to conclude the leave it command it is going to be a very important command to train your dog not to eat chew or dig certain items
csrzjbw3oty_1-5-rgb_front you can use this command whether something falls off a bathroom counter a kitchen counter if your dog is attempting to counter surf for food or if you are on a walk and the dog attempts to eat a taco bell wrapper or cat poop
csrzjbw3oty_2-5-rgb_front to illustrate again we will start with a tin man bait the dog to get attention lightly down on one knee gently hold the collar place the treat down a foot and a half away hold three to five seconds and release with the command take
csrzjbw3oty_3-5-rgb_front as i said you can use any release command but get your dog in tune to the same word so they know it is acceptable to eat smell or chew something upon that release command
csrzjbw3oty_4-5-rgb_front by practicing the leave it it also will show your dog that you are the boss
ctsjtnes_hs_1-1-rgb_front what we want to talk about now is when kicking an extra point or a field goal you want to have the proper kicking mechanisms
ctsjtnes_hs_10-1-rgb_front you see he has his body straight up and when he kicks through watch how high his leg extension is when he kicks through video demo
ctsjtnes_hs_11-1-rgb_front he has good mechanics he has his body open when he comes through he explodes the leg through he keeps it straight and he kicks it up as high as he possibly can
ctsjtnes_hs_12-1-rgb_front you can see if he was bent over he would not have been able to get that leg extension
ctsjtnes_hs_13-1-rgb_front it is all about kicking the ball and getting the most out of your body when you make the kick
ctsjtnes_hs_14-1-rgb_front we are going to see what it looks like at full speed
ctsjtnes_hs_15-1-rgb_front watch his balance as he approaches in the way he kicks his leg through and up and how he gets good height when he kicks the ball through video demo
ctsjtnes_hs_16-1-rgb_front you can see his balance as he comes through
ctsjtnes_hs_17-1-rgb_front everything was straight everything was exploding through the ball very good and balanced
ctsjtnes_hs_2-1-rgb_front what we are talking about first of all is obviously balance
ctsjtnes_hs_3-1-rgb_front when you approach the ball to kick a field goal you do not want to be leaned over
ctsjtnes_hs_4-1-rgb_front if you lean over you can not get good leg extension
ctsjtnes_hs_5-1-rgb_front you will only be able to kick your leg up as high as you are bent over and that will not allow you to kick it very far
ctsjtnes_hs_6-1-rgb_front you also do not want to be on your back foot
ctsjtnes_hs_7-1-rgb_front when you plant you do not want to be leaning backward or you will kick the ball straight up in the air
ctsjtnes_hs_8-1-rgb_front so it takes a lot of good balance
ctsjtnes_hs_9-1-rgb_front john is going to demonstrate
cve-33jxceo_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is rachel and i am the owner of austinstylewatch com street fashion site and i am also a freelance fashion reporter and today i am going to talk to you about how to choose a charm for your charm bracelet
cve-33jxceo_1-8-rgb_front now charm bracelets go way back
cve-33jxceo_11-8-rgb_front if you are doing gold you are going to always want to stick with solid gold
cve-33jxceo_12-8-rgb_front if you do not like to stick with that standard theme and you kind of want to get kooky with what you are doing there a lot of different turns on charms out there that will bring a little color into your bracelet
cve-33jxceo_13-8-rgb_front you can look for enamel charms that have been colored in with the glass enamel
cve-33jxceo_14-8-rgb_front you can also look for and these are a little pricey but jewels and gems inside charms to kind of make the bracelet a little more upscale
cve-33jxceo_15-8-rgb_front i also wanted to talk about two other types of charm bracelets that have kind of come up in popularity with charm bracelets resurgence and that is the european charm bracelet which is really a combination of different types of silver and jeweled beads so it is definitely nothing like what we think of as the american charm bracelet and there is also the italian charm bracelet and these you will see a lot of different stores nowadays and they are flat bracelets with charms kind of riveted into it and it is connecting links so that is how you get in the different little charms is the links of the bracelet so this has been how to choose a charm for your charm bracelet
cve-33jxceo_2-8-rgb_front actually depending on how you are judging it way way far back
cve-33jxceo_3-8-rgb_front they were popularized as catholic symbols and tools to show your beliefs and then they came back in the is as kind of kitschy little pieces that teens collected and each charm on bracelets in the is would usually represent an important moment in a person is life
cve-33jxceo_4-8-rgb_front you would have a birthday one you would have a marriage one you would have a graduation one so it is sort of like a story on a bracelet
cve-33jxceo_5-8-rgb_front it kind of fell out of fashion during the is when disco era big chains came in but charm bracelets have made a recent resurgence and that makes buying a charm really easy right now so there is a lot of places selling them
cve-33jxceo_6-8-rgb_front there is a lot of companies bringing it back and the trade of vintage charms has become really big so when you are selecting charms for a charm bracelet assuming you do not yet have your bracelet it is something to think about before you really get started collecting
cve-33jxceo_7-8-rgb_front when you get the bracelet you sort of commit to a motif
cve-33jxceo_8-8-rgb_front if you are going to get a gold one you kind of commit to gold
cve-33jxceo_9_10-8-rgb_front if you are going to get a silver one you kind of commit to silver colors expense sterling silver versus cheap if you are going to want to keep a theme with your whole bracelet you are going to want to put some thought when you are first buying it into what color what look for the long term are you going to really want so when you decide that theme you are going to want to stick with a light metal so if you are doing silver you are going to always want to stick with sterling silver
cvgkqk7bip4_1-5-rgb_front myth number my dog fears me and he know who is boss
cvgkqk7bip4_10-5-rgb_front she told me my dog responds me she comes to me but she respects my husband more
cvgkqk7bip4_11-5-rgb_front well the dog has to listen to you too i told her
cvgkqk7bip4_12-5-rgb_front husband comes in late dog is all over the place
cvgkqk7bip4_13-5-rgb_front she is like we have to do something about this dog
cvgkqk7bip4_14-5-rgb_front he yells at the dog go to the kitchen
cvgkqk7bip4_15_16_17-5-rgb_front like a bullet i ask him the question does the dog come to you when you call him he told me well apart from all these other problems we are having with the dog i need to my dog to come to me when i call him
cvgkqk7bip4_18-5-rgb_front what happen there is he got his result lesson taught
cvgkqk7bip4_19-5-rgb_front he got the dog to do exactly what he wanted him to do but he taught him the wrong lesson
cvgkqk7bip4_2-5-rgb_front you need fear in your dog so that he respects you
cvgkqk7bip4_20-5-rgb_front the lesson he taught him is to be fearful of him
cvgkqk7bip4_21-5-rgb_front when he gets into the kitchen now the dog is in a back room because that is the lesson that he taught him
cvgkqk7bip4_22-5-rgb_front his got to the kitchen training when down the drain
cvgkqk7bip4_23-5-rgb_front there is a difference between respect which he was not respecting him that is what she thought and fear
cvgkqk7bip4_3-5-rgb_front wrong
cvgkqk7bip4_4-5-rgb_front you want to make sure that your dog does things because he feels good about doing it
cvgkqk7bip4_5-5-rgb_front wants to please you not out of fear
cvgkqk7bip4_6-5-rgb_front out of fear you are going to have all kinds of behavioral problems later also
cvgkqk7bip4_7-5-rgb_front apart from him being fearful of you right
cvgkqk7bip4_8-5-rgb_front the other day for example there was a customer where the german shepherd was just jumping all over her
cvgkqk7bip4_9-5-rgb_front she had scratches from here to here
cxkfa8qu81e_0-5-rgb_front a really good thing to have in your studio if you are producing a lot of pieces is a damp area that is designated to keep pieces damp
cxkfa8qu81e_1-5-rgb_front now the way that this works i have built into a metal shelving unit i have added side pieces and then cross bars
cxkfa8qu81e_2-5-rgb_front and shelves can come in and out of these cross bars
cxkfa8qu81e_3-5-rgb_front when i am throwing pieces that i take directly off the wheel i can set them right onto this shelf and then slide it into this damp area or if i have thrown them on a bat i can set the bat on the shelf
cxkfa8qu81e_4-5-rgb_front now the benefit of doing this is that you do not have to throw plastic over pieces that are still very wet which can often leave marks it can deform them it can do a lot of things that are kind of unpleasant and cause you to do a lot of work later that you did not want to have to do
cxkfa8qu81e_5-5-rgb_front so this has a front door made of plastic
cxkfa8qu81e_6-5-rgb_front it is completely enclosed all the way around with plastic and then it is just got a large drape that comes over the front
cxkfa8qu81e_7-5-rgb_front now when i am going to leaves for a long period of time in here and i want them to stay damp i will spray down the damp area and then i will tape the sides shut so that no air flow will go through there
cxkfa8qu81e_8-5-rgb_front and on not incredibly dry days you can keep things in there for days on end without having a problem and they will stay damp for you
cxkfa8qu81e_9-5-rgb_front it is a really great way to save you some time and save you some effort
cytnoyfqyc0_0-8-rgb_front just to recap and summarize our grip
cytnoyfqyc0_1-8-rgb_front remember you are going to grip the racket and you turn it like that so the racket faces open
cytnoyfqyc0_10-8-rgb_front if i have a bad grip i can hit all types of bad shots but if i have the proper grip i am going to be much more cognizant of staying away from the ball and hitting a good shot
cytnoyfqyc0_11-8-rgb_front so the idea of why the grip is such a simple concept but it is so overlooked because people are always looking for those big improvements but the fastest way to improve your game is to get a good grip so that once again it is that open face on both sides so you see how you open the face and if you do that you will be able to hit a nice loft on the ball and you will have a good shot so remember with an open face that is an easy shot
cytnoyfqyc0_12-8-rgb_front with a closed face it is no good so open the face and your game will be good
cytnoyfqyc0_2-8-rgb_front grip the racket and turn it like that and that is what it should look like
cytnoyfqyc0_3-8-rgb_front if you have a nice grip it allows you to come underneath the ball and open the face under spin is the key to good squash
cytnoyfqyc0_4-8-rgb_front it is not like tennis where we hit top spin
cytnoyfqyc0_5-8-rgb_front in this game if you hit top spin you are going to drive it in to the tin and you are going to lose a lot of points
cytnoyfqyc0_6-8-rgb_front to be able to get the ball deep into the court you are going to have to have the racket open so you can hit the ball with some loft so the grip is really the foundation of everything
cytnoyfqyc0_7-8-rgb_front if you have a good grip that is going to force you to move in certain ways
cytnoyfqyc0_8-8-rgb_front see if i have a bad grip where i can use arm and shoulder i can move the ball any way i want because i will just adjust with my hand and arm but i will hit a bad shot virtually every time
cytnoyfqyc0_9-8-rgb_front the same goes on the forehand
cydu_ww4808_0-5-rgb_front here i have a puff sleeve and i have a thin band and a bow at the bottom of it as a closure
cydu_ww4808_1-5-rgb_front this will look good
cydu_ww4808_10-5-rgb_front and then i have a bow as a detail
cydu_ww4808_11-5-rgb_front you could do a button
cydu_ww4808_12-5-rgb_front you could do a tie anything but that is your closure right there
cydu_ww4808_13-5-rgb_front and there is your puff sleeve
cydu_ww4808_2-5-rgb_front i see party dresses with this
cydu_ww4808_3-5-rgb_front basically it is going to have the same arm hole as your shell as your basic sleeveless shell
cydu_ww4808_4-5-rgb_front not much variation there
cydu_ww4808_5-5-rgb_front and again how much puff you want is determined by how much fabric you are using
cydu_ww4808_6-5-rgb_front remember you have to put in all the fabric that you use that creates the puff is going to naturally measure more than the arm hole does
cydu_ww4808_7-5-rgb_front so you have to gather it and put it in and the more you gather it the more fabric you gather the more of a puff you get
cydu_ww4808_8-5-rgb_front and then on the opposite end at the bottom of the band you do the exact same thing pretty much
cydu_ww4808_9-5-rgb_front you take a band of fabric of given measurement typically whatever is going to fit around that person is arm and you bring the bottom of your puff all the fabric that creates the bottom of the puff gathered together and sewn into the band and then that creates the bottom of the puff
czioevwrgfg_0-5-rgb_front this is a type of skirt that i use when i go creeking and in a bigger water situations as well
czioevwrgfg_1-5-rgb_front this particular one made out under it is a little durable than a touring kayak skirt it also has a enclosure resistant bar and that is this bar right here it is built in with the skirt so that water can not punch through it and take it off of me while i am in the kayak
czioevwrgfg_2-5-rgb_front it has an elastic that goes all the way round towards back and a pull tab this pull tab is important cause this is how to get out of the kayak and i am going to show you how to put it on as well
czioevwrgfg_3-5-rgb_front when you put the skirt on the boat you want to grab the back of the elastic of the skirt pop it around the back coaling the back of the cockpit coaling which is this ram that sticks out from the boat make sure it is on there pretty snug so when you pull on the skirt it stays on flip the pull grab group push it all the way forward get it over the front of the cockpit combing run your fingers all the way back make sure the sides are on as well so that no water can come in then your skirt is on
czioevwrgfg_4-5-rgb_front you want to get your out of the boat when you take your skirt off you pull the pull grab loop give it a good snug it comes off the first time that is great if you need to run your fingers back toward the back of the cockpit combing that is good as well just make sure it is all the way off pull your knees together push out of the boat and then your done
czbkzfhpbsg_0-8-rgb_front these are also two other common instruments that a dentist uses basically everyday of their career
czbkzfhpbsg_1-8-rgb_front one being the straw the straw is basically a way of evacuating or eliminating all the spit and saliva that is in you are mouth while were doing dental procedures
czbkzfhpbsg_10-8-rgb_front there is basically an unlimited potential for dentist depending on what they pursue
czbkzfhpbsg_11-8-rgb_front it is obviously dictated by how big their personnel is and the size of the practice that they have
czbkzfhpbsg_12-8-rgb_front i know dentist that make as little as and i tell you dentists that make as much as a million
czbkzfhpbsg_13-8-rgb_front and again it is all variable based on you know what sort of services they provide how large their staff is how large that their patient clientele is certainly where they are practicing
czbkzfhpbsg_14-8-rgb_front it is definitely growing a recent statistic approximately a year or two ago has suggested that for every four dentist that were retiring only one dentist was entering into school
czbkzfhpbsg_15-8-rgb_front which is an outstanding feature for some one who is pursuing the career of dentistry because there is a lot of dentist that are baby boomers and because of that the access to dental care is becoming decrease very rapidly so it is a great time for someone to pursue dentistry
czbkzfhpbsg_2-8-rgb_front this is what is called a dental hand piece or core drill and this is the device that is typically used to help remove the cavity or the filling out of a tooth to help us fix it
czbkzfhpbsg_3-8-rgb_front every geographical location dictates the income of the dentist
czbkzfhpbsg_4-8-rgb_front now typically typically a dentist if i am not mistaken the household income of a dentist i believe in was approximately
czbkzfhpbsg_5-8-rgb_front that again can be very variable because depends certainly on the location where your at
czbkzfhpbsg_6-8-rgb_front it also depends on how much you work
czbkzfhpbsg_7-8-rgb_front some dentist will work as little as three days a week some work six days a week some work fridays some work saturdays there is a lot of flexibility in the schedule and it also goes hand in hand with fact that whether or not the dentist is working for himself or a group practice or a hospital or even the military
czbkzfhpbsg_8-8-rgb_front so there is a lot of variability you know in the salary of a dentist depending upon where you are who you are working for and also how long you have been practicing
czbkzfhpbsg_9-8-rgb_front if you are going into like a residency so you want to get additional training it may be starting as little as or or if you go directly into private practice which is what most people do when they graduate dental school they could start out for as much as probably i would say as much as to
czhgkz4jnnk_0-8-rgb_front hi so what is green tea
czhgkz4jnnk_1-8-rgb_front green tea you need to keep in mind the best ones come from china and japan
czhgkz4jnnk_10-8-rgb_front in addition green tea has moderate amount of caffeine because it is still processed a little bit
czhgkz4jnnk_11-8-rgb_front the pan firing is done to keep the tea leaves green
czhgkz4jnnk_12-8-rgb_front after that they would take it off the wok or the steamer and let the leaves dry on their own
czhgkz4jnnk_13-8-rgb_front but in chinese version they would roll into various shapes and sizes and such
czhgkz4jnnk_2-8-rgb_front green tea also is not fermented is a term that is used a lot
czhgkz4jnnk_3-8-rgb_front it is not also oxidized either
czhgkz4jnnk_4-8-rgb_front once you have picked green tea what is usually done it is taken automatically into heat
czhgkz4jnnk_5-8-rgb_front in japan they would steam it in china they would pan fire it and put it into a big wok and add heat to it to stop the tea leaves from withering
czhgkz4jnnk_6-8-rgb_front this process keeps green tea green
czhgkz4jnnk_7-8-rgb_front the brew will have a light gold to a green tint
czhgkz4jnnk_8-8-rgb_front the japanese tea you will see a darker emerald type of green
czhgkz4jnnk_9-8-rgb_front and in this regard green tea has a lot of antioxidants that is not present in other teas such as oolong or black
c_m23pd7jhc_0-5-rgb_front these moldings here i tend to use in a cowboy type thoughts
c_m23pd7jhc_1-5-rgb_front this particular one here i used around a lady who had won her ribbon for roping a cow
c_m23pd7jhc_10-5-rgb_front this is actually something that you can put around a document you can put it around a photo or put it around a piece of art and it is going to fit in almost everyones home
c_m23pd7jhc_2-5-rgb_front they had a picture of her roping the cow the cow that helped her win the ribbon
c_m23pd7jhc_3-5-rgb_front her husband is a great cowboy he is very cowboy he wears cowboy hat blue jeans boots the whole bit
c_m23pd7jhc_4-5-rgb_front and she told me i need this to hang in my husbands office and you know how much of a cowboy he is
c_m23pd7jhc_5-5-rgb_front so i got to looking at the picture and decided that i wanted to use this with it cause it just look like him
c_m23pd7jhc_6-5-rgb_front several of these are the same way they are very much cowboy looking
c_m23pd7jhc_7-5-rgb_front they fit in other things as well but i tend to reach for them often when i am dealing with my cowboy people or my country people
c_m23pd7jhc_8-5-rgb_front because they just fit it is a very earthy frame
c_m23pd7jhc_9-5-rgb_front most cowboys are very earthy people people are very earthy people and they tend to lean not as fancy as thought
ca1_w8lzuma_0-5-rgb_front now it is time to warm up the lips
ca1_w8lzuma_1-5-rgb_front the first thing that you want to do is you want to think in terms of creating voiceless sounds through your lips
ca1_w8lzuma_2-5-rgb_front i want you to blow air through your lips just allowing them to flutter
ca1_w8lzuma_3-5-rgb_front sometimes you might do that when you get frustrated you might blow air through your lips
ca1_w8lzuma_4-5-rgb_front and you want to do that times allowing your lips to flutter
ca1_w8lzuma_5-5-rgb_front i am sorry that makes my nose itch that fluttering
ca1_w8lzuma_6-5-rgb_front the next thing that you want to do is blow vibration through
ca1_w8lzuma_7-5-rgb_front so the first time through we just have that little flutter and now we really want to put a hard vibrating sound on our lip where you really get a vibration you really get a nose itching kind of really vibrating feeling
ca1_w8lzuma_8-5-rgb_front so a light flutter a voiceless sound and then a flutter of the lips
ca1_w8lzuma_9-5-rgb_front that is the first thing that you want to do to get your lips warmed up
ca54j6d5hka_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to be talking about road cranks
ca54j6d5hka_10-5-rgb_front and they have made the bearings that go into the frame much larger because they now sit it outside of the frame
ca54j6d5hka_11-5-rgb_front all of this adds up to extreme stiffness strength and a great riding crank that can make a big difference in your riding and your power
ca54j6d5hka_2-5-rgb_front this can be a great upgrade to any road bike out there
ca54j6d5hka_3-5-rgb_front one of the top names in the business of course is shimano
ca54j6d5hka_4-5-rgb_front shimano is one of the companies that really is a pioneering company for both lightweight strength durability
ca54j6d5hka_5-5-rgb_front with this particular crank we are going to look at today is their crank
ca54j6d5hka_6-5-rgb_front what i have got here is a very interesting cutaway which really shows how they get that lightweight but yet extremely stiff and strong crank
ca54j6d5hka_7-5-rgb_front again to distribute that power from our pedals now right through to the drive crank to propel us froward quicker
ca54j6d5hka_8-5-rgb_front they made the entire crank hollow all this being done while it is done in a casting process
ca54j6d5hka_9-5-rgb_front we have also made the axle integrated into the crank arm itself makes for a much stronger much larger axle
cash1hzrhza_0-5-rgb_front okay
cash1hzrhza_1-5-rgb_front so now we are going to look at how to string a classical guitar
cash1hzrhza_10-5-rgb_front bring it around and bring it underneath the string
cash1hzrhza_11-5-rgb_front and then we will bring it down a little bit so we have a little bit of room and enough slack so that we can bend it again and push it through
cash1hzrhza_12-5-rgb_front now once we have done that we should be able to take it and do one more just like that
cash1hzrhza_13-5-rgb_front and then we will pull the string very tightly so that we can get that all the slack
cash1hzrhza_14-5-rgb_front get the knots nice and tight
cash1hzrhza_15-5-rgb_front okay
cash1hzrhza_16-5-rgb_front we have the post turned so that the hole is facing us
cash1hzrhza_17-5-rgb_front we just put the string through the hole in this way
cash1hzrhza_18-5-rgb_front and this allows us to tie
cash1hzrhza_19-5-rgb_front this is much more flexible this little couple of inches at the end of the string
cash1hzrhza_2-5-rgb_front so we are going to go ahead and we are going to tie on we are going to change the sixth string on this guitar or the low e string
cash1hzrhza_20-5-rgb_front it allows us to put a little knot in if we choose to
cash1hzrhza_21-5-rgb_front there are several different methods of locking
cash1hzrhza_22-5-rgb_front so what i am doing is i am holding the tension on both sides of this little knot that we have tied
cash1hzrhza_23-5-rgb_front and this is just one method of many
cash1hzrhza_24-5-rgb_front and as we do this you can if you choose to even again wrap the end of the knot back around the string
cash1hzrhza_25-5-rgb_front and it will stay enough so that we can simply pull
cash1hzrhza_26-5-rgb_front we are turning the key and rolling the post
cash1hzrhza_27-5-rgb_front and that pulls this string that we are turning onto the post over the top of our knot on the outside if you notice
cash1hzrhza_28-5-rgb_front when i say the outside i mean the outside of the hole on the post you see
cash1hzrhza_29-5-rgb_front all right
cash1hzrhza_3-5-rgb_front okay
cash1hzrhza_30-5-rgb_front and then after we have done that once maybe twice where we have come around to our tie
cash1hzrhza_31-5-rgb_front we have crossed it
cash1hzrhza_32-5-rgb_front now we can go ahead and take our string and bring it across
cash1hzrhza_33-5-rgb_front as you see we have brought it across our first wind around the peg or the post
cash1hzrhza_34-5-rgb_front now some strings will have an excess amount of length on the string
cash1hzrhza_35-5-rgb_front and you will check it and you can go ahead and cut it
cash1hzrhza_36-5-rgb_front you want to just make sure you have got a good three inches or so
cash1hzrhza_37-5-rgb_front we are keeping a consistency of tension as we are putting the string on the guitar which helps a whole lot in the string is ability to hold its tune once you are done
cash1hzrhza_38-5-rgb_front so let is go ahead and see
cash1hzrhza_39-5-rgb_front finish this here
cash1hzrhza_4-5-rgb_front and we are going to start by a lot of times you will have strings your classical guitar strings you will notice that at the end they will have a little bit of winding that kind of thins out and you will have an inch or two
cash1hzrhza_40-5-rgb_front and we kind of keep the same amount of tension
cash1hzrhza_41-5-rgb_front as the string gets closer to the neck the tension obviously increases
cash1hzrhza_5-5-rgb_front you will notice that at the end where the string is a different width
cash1hzrhza_6-5-rgb_front and that you will use at your top through the headstock
cash1hzrhza_7-5-rgb_front the classical guitar you will have holes for each string
cash1hzrhza_8-5-rgb_front and what you are going to do is put the string through in this direction towards the bottom of the guitar
cash1hzrhza_9-5-rgb_front we will wrap the string around once underneath
caemc6ec3qc_1-8-rgb_front it is really good to take your child to the restroom as frequently as possible because in the beginning of potty training they do not know when they have to go and when they do they are going to just go in their clothes
caemc6ec3qc_2-8-rgb_front they do not know how to hold it like you and i eventually they are going to get to the point where they are going to but when they are really small they get really into what they are doing
caemc6ec3qc_3-8-rgb_front if they are playing they do not want to stop playing it is better to just drag them out of whatever they are doing and say it is time to go to the restroom and they are going to go
cbbb4mkvqqw_0-5-rgb_front now we are going to talk about what some things not to do that can create a lot of ill will and problems in relationships with regard to communication
cbbb4mkvqqw_1-5-rgb_front and this one is this is a hard one
cbbb4mkvqqw_10-5-rgb_front thus the climate of the workplace the climate of the school classroom the climate of any type of environment can be regulated by the people who gossip and the energy that that gossip puts out
cbbb4mkvqqw_11-5-rgb_front basically the bottom line on gossip is it is a negative thing that is very hard to repair
cbbb4mkvqqw_12-5-rgb_front and should be no matter how difficult avoided at all costs
cbbb4mkvqqw_13-5-rgb_front just do not do it
cbbb4mkvqqw_14-5-rgb_front just sacrifice not being in the in group
cbbb4mkvqqw_15-5-rgb_front do not gossip
cbbb4mkvqqw_2-5-rgb_front this is a hard one to resist
cbbb4mkvqqw_3-5-rgb_front it is gossip
cbbb4mkvqqw_4-5-rgb_front and what is gossip
cbbb4mkvqqw_5-5-rgb_front well it is social talk that makes evaluations about another person when they are not there to defend themselves basically
cbbb4mkvqqw_6-5-rgb_front but gossip actually does a lot of other things well
cbbb4mkvqqw_7-5-rgb_front it can create some very negative things which if you are in it it might not seem negative but to the outsider looking in can be very negative
cbbb4mkvqqw_8-5-rgb_front gossip can create an in group the group that gossips together
cbbb4mkvqqw_9-5-rgb_front can cause can help regulate the behavior of an organization
cbuvaya-dec_1-8-rgb_front sleep as a model is very important you want to make sure that you get at least hours of sleep a day and i know hard because with your schedule on shoots on set very hard to get at least hours of sleep a day
cbuvaya-dec_2-8-rgb_front so you want to try to schedule it in your calendar to where you can get may be or hours here another hour there to add up to a full hours of sleep
cbuvaya-dec_3-8-rgb_front the effects of lack of sleep are tremendous i mean your eyes it shows in your eyes your face how you carry yourself and how you do your work
cbuvaya-dec_4-8-rgb_front you also want to make sure that when you get your sleep how little it may be at a time that actual restful sleep and another way to do that is maybe by doing some meditation or listening to soft classical music while sleeping
cbuvaya-dec_5-8-rgb_front like i said you want to schedule it in your calendar to make sure that you can work in at least hours of sleep especially while on set
cbuvaya-dec_6-8-rgb_front to sleep is so important as a model you want to get old before your time
cbuvaya-dec_7-8-rgb_front you may visit me at www myspace thank you for visiting have a great day
cc1abgxzjds_6-5-rgb_front and they have a nice heavy feel to them and are usually not too expensive
cc1abgxzjds_7-5-rgb_front and that is glass chess sets
ccwcwiikp_q_10-8-rgb_front the third step is then bring your pitcher back up submerge the tip back into the milk and keep swirling until you reach the right temperature
ccwcwiikp_q_3-8-rgb_front so what i am going to do to steam the milk for a single latte is drop the steam wand down in to where this tip of the steam wand is below the surface of the milk and turn on the steam wand
ccwcwiikp_q_4-8-rgb_front there is then three processes that go into steaming the milk for the latte and the first is after i turn it on i have the tip on the steam one submerged below the surface of the milk with the steam one resting in this ridge and i have the pitcher held at the right angle so that the milk is swirling inside the pitcher
ccwcwiikp_q_5-8-rgb_front you got to keep it swirling until right when you feel the milk warm up
ccwcwiikp_q_6-8-rgb_front you feel it kind of match the temperature of your hand and its right at about degrees and then you are going to want to drop it down toward the tip of the steam wand is just above the surface of the milk
ccwcwiikp_q_7-8-rgb_front that is going to start introducing air into the milk and that is where you make your foam
ccwcwiikp_q_8-8-rgb_front now that we are making a latte you are not going to do that quite as long as you would for a cappuccino
ccwcwiikp_q_9-8-rgb_front see there is less foam goes into a latte
cd6_mrfsabg_0-5-rgb_front we are going to go and cover the handle of the wagon with some tissue paper make it a little bit more decorative
cd6_mrfsabg_1-5-rgb_front for that we will use a different color and we are going to use the same glue that we used for the green tissue paper over the body of the wagon
cd6_mrfsabg_2-5-rgb_front we just go ahead and coat the entire surface of the paper towel holder and once it is fully coated we will go ahead and take pieces of the tissue paper and we will just lay it across the same way that we did to the shoebox to the body of the wagon
cd6_mrfsabg_3-5-rgb_front it does not really matter how it is laid across
cd6_mrfsabg_4-5-rgb_front it gives it a nice effect even if it is not fully spread out so that it lays completely flat and the tissue paper will also be a fun activity for the kids that can give them more time to glue and paste
cd6_mrfsabg_5-5-rgb_front make sure that you take pieces and cover up all of the spaces
cd6_mrfsabg_6-5-rgb_front the wagon can be used to actually play with because it does move or it could just be used as a decoration to put things inside and to be left into a child is room
cd6_mrfsabg_7-5-rgb_front i have seen people even use this type of project to put plants and things inside and in a playroom or a kid is room so there is a lot of things you can do
cd6_mrfsabg_8-5-rgb_front it is a really nice project and gives a lot of room for creativity as you can decorate it and cover it in any way you want so now i have showed you how to cover the handle and finish the project for the wagon
cdwey8_wfza_0-8-rgb_front i am going to lay in this shot and i want to show you something
cdwey8_wfza_1-8-rgb_front now you can see from this angle the v that is what we are looking for the v or or what i want to say the funnel
cdwey8_wfza_10-8-rgb_front more space is provided more a dew is created and it spills into the bucket
cdwey8_wfza_11-8-rgb_front and we all like i said we also have the top for the a the rain water
cdwey8_wfza_12-8-rgb_front so that is the whole theory behind the solar still
cdwey8_wfza_2-8-rgb_front the reason why again is if it rains tonight this the rain that will hit here is going to run down this v towards the stone into the bucket
cdwey8_wfza_3-8-rgb_front the morning dew collects underneath it so this is why it is shaped the way it is as you can see the the strong funnel v so if you have it like this you know you are in good shape
cdwey8_wfza_4-8-rgb_front the stones right over the the slit and now let is let me explain the whole theory behind all this work
cdwey8_wfza_5-8-rgb_front you ever hear of the green house effect
cdwey8_wfza_6-8-rgb_front when water is enclosed it creates this this precipitation this dew
cdwey8_wfza_7-8-rgb_front we have water like i showed you earlier in the ground here and when it this tarp heats up it creates the green house effect and the dew from that water will start to form on the underneath of this v v tarp and funnel tarp
cdwey8_wfza_8-8-rgb_front as it accumulates more and more it will make space it will actually push the the the dew into the bucket and more dew will start to accumulate on the tarp and it will keep doing this process as more dew drips in there it creates more open space
cdwey8_wfza_9-8-rgb_front and more of that rain water heats up and creates more dew on the tarp so it is this constant cycle of the dew forms spills into the bucket
ce3agdfnapw_0_1-8-rgb_front ok now that myra is hair is sectioned off and i am ready to apply color i want to mix my color you do not want to mix your color too early
ce3agdfnapw_10-8-rgb_front and you want to lightly shake this
ce3agdfnapw_11-8-rgb_front you do not want to be too vigorous with it
ce3agdfnapw_12-8-rgb_front probably that is about right
ce3agdfnapw_13-8-rgb_front you can see that everything has been mixed all the way through
ce3agdfnapw_14-8-rgb_front there is no lightener or color separated
ce3agdfnapw_15-8-rgb_front it is all mixed pretty good
ce3agdfnapw_16-8-rgb_front if you shake it too much it actually heats up the molecules and speeds up the color process
ce3agdfnapw_17-8-rgb_front so it does not process properly
ce3agdfnapw_18-8-rgb_front so just a light shake
ce3agdfnapw_19-8-rgb_front make sure that cover that hole is covered
ce3agdfnapw_2-8-rgb_front because it actually starts the color process at that time
ce3agdfnapw_20-8-rgb_front and now we are ready to apply color
ce3agdfnapw_3-8-rgb_front so in my bottle i have nothing but my hair color
ce3agdfnapw_4-8-rgb_front this is after i have been to the store chose the right color
ce3agdfnapw_5-8-rgb_front and this actually has measuring lines on the bottle itself
ce3agdfnapw_6-8-rgb_front so i am going to follow my measuring lines
ce3agdfnapw_7-8-rgb_front apply my developer which now once you apply the developer the color starts to process
ce3agdfnapw_8-8-rgb_front put your cover on
ce3agdfnapw_9-8-rgb_front make sure you cover the opening with your finger
celb3uj9_ko_0-8-rgb_front there is so many beautiful stained glass pieces to choose from
celb3uj9_ko_1-8-rgb_front it almost seems silly to incorporate other things but why not
celb3uj9_ko_10-8-rgb_front here is an example of a piece in which i used a couple of multimedia highlights
celb3uj9_ko_11-8-rgb_front most of this is stained glass but i have a glass bead up here i have glitter glass windows the millifiore flowers as a doorknob and flowers in the grass
celb3uj9_ko_12-8-rgb_front it adds texture depth and a touch of class
celb3uj9_ko_13-8-rgb_front here is another example
celb3uj9_ko_14-8-rgb_front in this piece i used stained glass to make the bamboo i used tempered glass for the background
celb3uj9_ko_15-8-rgb_front tempered glass is really easy to find in a city like sanfransisco when people get their car windows broken
celb3uj9_ko_16-8-rgb_front it is also easy to find if you know contractors who break down shower doors or shower windows
celb3uj9_ko_17-8-rgb_front all that glass is tempered and can make a beautiful sparkling effect on your piece
celb3uj9_ko_18-8-rgb_front remember you have a lot of creativity in this project so be creative go wild go crazy use colors or do not
celb3uj9_ko_19-8-rgb_front just enjoy the process be patient with yourself and have a good time
celb3uj9_ko_2-8-rgb_front sometimes i like to use little glitter glass in my pieces or glass beads
celb3uj9_ko_3-8-rgb_front you can also feel free to use little tiles some come in shapes already precut for you
celb3uj9_ko_4-8-rgb_front these are glass flowers
celb3uj9_ko_5-8-rgb_front they are italian made they are called millifiore million flowers
celb3uj9_ko_6-8-rgb_front they can add nice little highlights and touches in your pieces
celb3uj9_ko_7-8-rgb_front you can even add soveniers
celb3uj9_ko_8-8-rgb_front this is a buddha from a trip i took to thailand
celb3uj9_ko_9-8-rgb_front it will look beautiful in a piece
cft0amwavuo_0-5-rgb_front i am going to be doing pressure points on the head all going towards the crown
cft0amwavuo_1-5-rgb_front when you have a headache this is a great way to relieve the stress of the headache
cft0amwavuo_2-5-rgb_front it might not take care of it but it will relieve the stress of the headache
cft0amwavuo_3-5-rgb_front i am using my thumbs going down the center of the back of the head
cft0amwavuo_4_5_6-5-rgb_front i am going towards the crown if we had a headache i would probably be staying there a little bit longer maybe not necessarily using my thumbs but i can also use my middle finger or my index finger or both and just staying there a little bit longer
cft0amwavuo_7-5-rgb_front going towards the crown
cft0amwavuo_8-5-rgb_front when i get to the crown i give it a nice double thumb pressure
cft0amwavuo_9-5-rgb_front a little pressing
ch8dtxid3ng_0-5-rgb_front using your oil lamps and converting them to electric is a really great way to make them functional today in our homes today
ch8dtxid3ng_1-5-rgb_front so what i suggest is you take the number one burner and you just unscrew it and take it off and take this number one that has been electrified and i put the globe right on it
ch8dtxid3ng_10-5-rgb_front they are all going to be a little bit different but i like to make sure the shade is covers that portion of the lamp and this seems to fit just about the right size and i will show you
ch8dtxid3ng_2-5-rgb_front it has the exact same size of the threads on the bottom that you can see that are going to fit right into the center of the collar of the oil lamp
ch8dtxid3ng_3-5-rgb_front so you are going to screw that right on to the base very simple easy to do
ch8dtxid3ng_4-5-rgb_front an inexpensive way to convert your oil lamps to functional oil lamps today
ch8dtxid3ng_5-5-rgb_front so there you have your lamp with your electric burner on top and you can take any one of these shades
ch8dtxid3ng_6-5-rgb_front it does not necessarily have to be one of these shades but i find that this size in particular fits this particular lamp and you will see that you are going to have to measure the size of the height width and clip of each of these shades to make them fit proportionally with your lamp
ch8dtxid3ng_7-5-rgb_front ideally when you put a shade onto a lamp like this you do not want to see the brass collar here
ch8dtxid3ng_8-5-rgb_front you want it to come down to the old collar that would make it proportionally to the lamp
ch8dtxid3ng_9-5-rgb_front you have about as much space up here as you have down here on this particular lamp
chdvd0wh8hu_0-5-rgb_front alright for indoor and outdoor hockey roller hockey you need a ball for outdoor and for indoor you would want to use a specified roller hockey puck
chdvd0wh8hu_1-5-rgb_front they sell them to they will sell them to any sporting goods store would have them
chdvd0wh8hu_10-5-rgb_front it just does not work very well if you have a lot of cracks stuff like that
chdvd0wh8hu_11-5-rgb_front the puck will be bouncing around
chdvd0wh8hu_12-5-rgb_front so typically outdoors what you want is just a roller hockey ball
chdvd0wh8hu_13-5-rgb_front it just works good rolling around out here
chdvd0wh8hu_14-5-rgb_front you can stick handle really good with it
chdvd0wh8hu_15-5-rgb_front and it works great
chdvd0wh8hu_16-5-rgb_front so use that
chdvd0wh8hu_2-5-rgb_front you can go there and check it out and they can tell you which ones are the best ones or whatever
chdvd0wh8hu_3-5-rgb_front basically a roller hockey puck is basically the same size as a regular ice hockey puck
chdvd0wh8hu_4-5-rgb_front it would be a little bit lighter
chdvd0wh8hu_5-5-rgb_front it is made of plastic
chdvd0wh8hu_6-5-rgb_front but at the pro shop they would be able to explain it a little bit better and you can check it out
chdvd0wh8hu_7-5-rgb_front see if you want to get one of those
chdvd0wh8hu_8-5-rgb_front if you need it or whatever
chdvd0wh8hu_9-5-rgb_front you can use them outdoor too if you want
ck8pd1xb2hm_0-5-rgb_front hi
ck8pd1xb2hm_10-5-rgb_front of course it is very difficult to tell so you are going to use the test
ck8pd1xb2hm_11-5-rgb_front right there it is still a little bit greasy but you can hear on the side over here
ck8pd1xb2hm_12-5-rgb_front we have got all that grease up
ck8pd1xb2hm_13-5-rgb_front it might also be a problem on the glass inside of your microwave oven so you want to probably use some cleaner on the inside of that to keep it clean and streak free
ck8pd1xb2hm_2-5-rgb_front as well as the boiled water technique works for cleaning out baked on gunk from the top sides and even bottom of your microwave water alone is not going to help if you have some slick butter or grease that is been spilled inside that microwave
ck8pd1xb2hm_3-5-rgb_front for that we are going to need something to cut the grease
ck8pd1xb2hm_4-5-rgb_front this will take soap of some sort
ck8pd1xb2hm_5-5-rgb_front i am going to use an organic cleaner
ck8pd1xb2hm_6-5-rgb_front you do not want to spray it in your microwave
ck8pd1xb2hm_7-5-rgb_front you have got vents all over the sides and the top which can easily get cleaner in them and that is going to potentially mess up your microwave down the line
ck8pd1xb2hm_8-5-rgb_front just spray it right on your sponge and then you are going to use that to wipe up that grease
ck8pd1xb2hm_9-5-rgb_front it should take it off in a wipe or
ckefgaf2zkc_0-8-rgb_front hi
ckefgaf2zkc_10-8-rgb_front once i have my box leveled i am going to remove that level and draw around each side of my box
ckefgaf2zkc_11-8-rgb_front when i remove my box i will have my lines
ckefgaf2zkc_2-8-rgb_front in this video clip i will be showing you how to properly mark for an electrical box
ckefgaf2zkc_3-8-rgb_front on this section of wall i want an electrical box to go right here
ckefgaf2zkc_4-8-rgb_front if i stick it on there and just mark around my electrical box there is a good chance that my box is going to be crooked and its not going to look good
ckefgaf2zkc_5-8-rgb_front what i like to do is grab a combination square and some other type of tool that may have a small level built into it
ckefgaf2zkc_6-8-rgb_front go ahead and remove that piece and i have this little level
ckefgaf2zkc_7-8-rgb_front now i have also used a line level in the past which is a real small level or you could just buy a very short level
ckefgaf2zkc_8-8-rgb_front next i am going to put my box onto my wall and set that level on top of it
ckefgaf2zkc_9-8-rgb_front i am going to go ahead and adjust it so that my bubble goes in the middle that way i will know that box is perfectly level
clxja4ok8bs_0-5-rgb_front hello
clxja4ok8bs_10-5-rgb_front adults love to play in birthday parties

clxja4ok8bs_2-5-rgb_front its time to party
clxja4ok8bs_3-5-rgb_front now we are going to discuss the appropriate games for the birthday party
clxja4ok8bs_4-5-rgb_front for example if you are having a party for a year old you want to choose games that are lively
clxja4ok8bs_5-5-rgb_front invite a clown have face painting
clxja4ok8bs_6-5-rgb_front have games that are going to make the children and when they leave they will be glad that they came to the birthday party

clxja4ok8bs_9-5-rgb_front do not forget about adults
cmfd-ykgj0w_0-9-rgb_front in this clip were going to talk about the importance of the spray skirt
cmfd-ykgj0w_1-9-rgb_front we wear a spray skirt th keep the water out of boats
cmfd-ykgj0w_10-9-rgb_front russel here is pulling on it and you can see the skirts not coming off immediately
cmfd-ykgj0w_11-9-rgb_front this could set you into panic
cmfd-ykgj0w_12-9-rgb_front so always practice pulling that skirt forward then back
cmfd-ykgj0w_13-9-rgb_front this will release the tightest skirt
cmfd-ykgj0w_14-9-rgb_front now there s different types of spray skirts
cmfd-ykgj0w_15-9-rgb_front people this may be a little bit to tight so you can get a nylon skirt comes off very easily
cmfd-ykgj0w_16-9-rgb_front we prefer neoprene because when were in rougher water like waves and serf and white water it does not come off as easily
cmfd-ykgj0w_17-9-rgb_front this may come off but on regular day paddle if you just want to keep the sun and water off your legs a nylon skirt works really well
cmfd-ykgj0w_18-9-rgb_front we also want to show you another way to remove a spray skirt
cmfd-ykgj0w_19-9-rgb_front often times were in a hurry to get on the water because others ore waiting for us
cmfd-ykgj0w_2-9-rgb_front russel is going though show you how to put on a neoprene spray skirt
cmfd-ykgj0w_20-9-rgb_front so we may inadvertently put our loop in
cmfd-ykgj0w_21-9-rgb_front so what we want to do is not be depending on the loop to pull the spray skirt off
cmfd-ykgj0w_22-9-rgb_front it is like a shower cap it is just a bunch of cord around the undercut
cmfd-ykgj0w_23-9-rgb_front you just pull it off
cmfd-ykgj0w_24-9-rgb_front russel here is going to show how to pull it off without using the loop
cmfd-ykgj0w_25-9-rgb_front he turns to one side digs in and pulls the skirt away from the cockpit coning
cmfd-ykgj0w_26-9-rgb_front see how easy that is
cmfd-ykgj0w_27-9-rgb_front this is something that you really should practice
cmfd-ykgj0w_28-9-rgb_front and we challenge our self that if we should capsize we try not to pull the loop at first we practice by not using the loop
cmfd-ykgj0w_3-9-rgb_front first were going to start and always start in the back
cmfd-ykgj0w_4-9-rgb_front fully engage it in the under cut of cockpit coning work it around the sides and then pull it on
cmfd-ykgj0w_5-9-rgb_front this is a pull loop so if you should capsize you can pull this loop and it releases
cmfd-ykgj0w_6-9-rgb_front russel is going to show you haw to remove a spray skirt
cmfd-ykgj0w_7-9-rgb_front pull forward then up
cmfd-ykgj0w_8-9-rgb_front he lets go of the spray skirt reaches around and pushes the back of the kayak and out he comes
cmfd-ykgj0w_9-9-rgb_front what is real important about the loop on your spray skirt is to pull it forward first instead of back first
cmi0-jjwroa_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to make smothered chicken with maque choux casserole
cmi0-jjwroa_10-5-rgb_front this is going to be a coating seasoning for your chicken
cmi0-jjwroa_2-5-rgb_front so now we are going to prepare the chicken but here is how we are going to do it
cmi0-jjwroa_3-5-rgb_front we want to create a flour dredge for it to brown up nicely
cmi0-jjwroa_4-5-rgb_front so here is how we do that
cmi0-jjwroa_5-5-rgb_front so i just like to pour some flour
cmi0-jjwroa_6-5-rgb_front i have a paper plate here you can use whatever you need then put that in here
cmi0-jjwroa_7-5-rgb_front we have a wheat flour here you can just use regular white flour if you like pretty southern tradition to do
cmi0-jjwroa_8-5-rgb_front seasoning it up a little bit so i am going to use some black pepper be pretty liberal with this because it is in the flour so all this is not going to be on the chicken
cmi0-jjwroa_9-5-rgb_front you have that and you have some nice salt here to put in
cnbusqft5hc_1-5-rgb_front and today we are making a campfire in my backyard in the snow in the winter months which is something we actually love to do be able to spend as much time as we can outdoors
cnbusqft5hc_2-5-rgb_front not everyone has an opportunity to be able to do a campfire like this
cnbusqft5hc_3-5-rgb_front now i happen to have a nice big backyard and so that really is a great thing for me but you need to be able to talk to your fire department or local places to see if you could actually and legally have a campfire and be able to roast marshmallows in a container
cnbusqft5hc_4-5-rgb_front we are going to talk about what type of surroundings you need to look for in order to make sure that you are safe when you actually build a campfire in your backyard but be familiar with your rules in your own community
cnbusqft5hc_5-5-rgb_front no matter where you live you need to kinda find out what you are allowed to do in your own little community before you start a campfire
cop58p_n38i_1-1-rgb_front now i am going to talk to you about how to decide if you are going to build a glue in or a bolt in neck
cop58p_n38i_10-1-rgb_front you can complete the body first make sure that it is done make sure it is going to work and then turn your attention to a neck
cop58p_n38i_11-1-rgb_front now bolt on necks are not as warm in sound as glue in necks but they are definitely going to be something that you would be able to pull off
cop58p_n38i_12-1-rgb_front this is what is referred to as a glue in neck again
cop58p_n38i_13-1-rgb_front and again this neck is actually glued in to the body it is not removeable once it is put in there
cop58p_n38i_14-1-rgb_front for these guitars the only way to take the neck out and put a new one in is to cut this neck out and route all of the material that is left from it from this body
cop58p_n38i_15-1-rgb_front so again this is something that is very difficult to change
cop58p_n38i_16-1-rgb_front if you break the neck it woud be very difficult for you to make another one to replace
cop58p_n38i_17-1-rgb_front in addition the fit between this neck and the body has to be fairly precise for you to get the appropriate return of vibration and tone
cop58p_n38i_18-1-rgb_front it requires a little more technical skill you have to be a lot more careful when you are putting this type of guitar together
cop58p_n38i_19-1-rgb_front but again it provides a very solid joint it is a permanent neck so if you do not like this neck you can not really change it
cop58p_n38i_2-1-rgb_front and i want to explain the differences to you of each of these types of designs and how they affect the sound and how they will affect your ability to build one
cop58p_n38i_20-1-rgb_front but again it is a solid connection
cop58p_n38i_21-1-rgb_front you will get more sustain with this type of neck then you will with a bolt on
cop58p_n38i_3-1-rgb_front let is begin with what is called a bolt on neck
cop58p_n38i_4-1-rgb_front as you can see once again we talked about that it has four screws that hold it in
cop58p_n38i_5-1-rgb_front and of course they do not protrude through the top
cop58p_n38i_6-1-rgb_front the benefits of the bolt on neck are that you can easily adjust the angle of the neck by applying shims under it
cop58p_n38i_7-1-rgb_front a small piece of wood a small piece of paper whatever to tilt the neck if you need to change the angle of the neck
cop58p_n38i_8-1-rgb_front also if you ever break the neck or lets go ahead and assume that at some point during the assembly process you have difficulty shall we say with the neck that you are working on and you decide that you want to start over
cop58p_n38i_9-1-rgb_front you will be able to do that with absolutely no problem it will not affect your body at all
coyy7sdvmac_1-8-rgb_front now this is an open front winter turnout blanket
coyy7sdvmac_10-8-rgb_front if you put a blanket on and there is dirt underneath the blanket it is just going to rub on your horse all the time so it is important to make sure that your horse is brushed off
coyy7sdvmac_11-8-rgb_front the open front is very easy to slide on
coyy7sdvmac_12-8-rgb_front all we need to do is just over the horse and again just buckle him up
coyy7sdvmac_13-8-rgb_front so we will start in the front do his chest straps he has three belly surcingle that we will do next
coyy7sdvmac_14-8-rgb_front and last but not least on this blanket a ham strap
coyy7sdvmac_15-8-rgb_front so that is how to take on and off an open front blanket
coyy7sdvmac_2-8-rgb_front let me show you the easiest way to take on and off a winter horse blanket
coyy7sdvmac_3-8-rgb_front first to take it off this is rudy he is already got it on unbuckle the front and this also has a velcro behind it so we will undo that as well
coyy7sdvmac_4-8-rgb_front then he is going to have three surcingles and we are going to undo those three surcingles and then this blanket also has the tail strap and we are going to take that off as well
coyy7sdvmac_5-8-rgb_front a turnout open front blanket is really easy
coyy7sdvmac_6-8-rgb_front we just slide it right off the side
coyy7sdvmac_7-8-rgb_front easy just like that
coyy7sdvmac_8-8-rgb_front now to put it back on when you are putting on your horse blanket obviously you want to make sure that your horse has been brushed
coyy7sdvmac_9-8-rgb_front it is just like before you put a saddle on
cpcdteywhpc_0-8-rgb_front proper golf etiquette is something that every golfer needs to know and practice while out on the golf course
cpcdteywhpc_1-8-rgb_front my name is jared garbett and i am with echo farms
cpcdteywhpc_10-8-rgb_front after marking the ball you can pick the ball up
cpcdteywhpc_11-8-rgb_front so that anybody else that is behind you is not in the way of your golf ball
cpcdteywhpc_12-8-rgb_front this is how practice proper golf etiquette while on the green
cpcdteywhpc_2-8-rgb_front and i am going to teach you how to practice proper golf etiquette while out on the putting green
cpcdteywhpc_3-8-rgb_front you are going to begin by taking the flag out of the flag stick
cpcdteywhpc_4-8-rgb_front making sure not to damage the edges of the cup
cpcdteywhpc_5-8-rgb_front going to gently place the flag stick on the ground making sure not to throw or drop it
cpcdteywhpc_6-8-rgb_front you are then going to check your line of path to walk so that you know you are not in anybody else is way
cpcdteywhpc_7-8-rgb_front seeing that the path is clear i can walk over and mark my golf ball
cpcdteywhpc_8-8-rgb_front whenever i get to my golf ball i want to take a coin or a ball marker and gently place it behind my golf ball
cpcdteywhpc_9-8-rgb_front making sure not to move my golf ball
cseuyspzgao_1-5-rgb_front you can find me in new york city and today i am going to teach you how to play a saw
cseuyspzgao_2-5-rgb_front about the time of world war ii saw playing almost disappeared
cseuyspzgao_3-5-rgb_front this was due to the fact that vaudeville it is main venue ceased to exist
cseuyspzgao_4-5-rgb_front also all metal was used for the manufacturing of ammunition and no new saws were manufactured
cseuyspzgao_5-5-rgb_front for saw playing you need a new saw with no rust on it and most of the men went to war
cseuyspzgao_6-5-rgb_front since most saw players were men there was nobody who would teach the younger generation how to play
cseuyspzgao_7-5-rgb_front therefore the art form disappeared
cseuyspzgao_8-5-rgb_front today it is regarded as if it is a new invention but actually it is very very old
cseuyspzgao_9-5-rgb_front i started bringing this art form back into popularity through performances recordings lecture demonstrations but mostly through working with composers of today urging them to incorporate the musical saw in new works
cu22tqwikio_0_1_2-5-rgb_front let is talk about how you keep score in the game of pyramid solitaire well you do not necessarily keep score it can be just a one hand affair but i do like to keep score
cu22tqwikio_3-5-rgb_front i have a bit of a competitive nature and i might compete with my previous score
cu22tqwikio_4-5-rgb_front so it is interesting to me to have a score at the end of a hand of pyramid if i have not completed the board
cu22tqwikio_5-5-rgb_front so the end of a hand is when you can make no more plays you have no more stock pile you are usually going to have a waste pile you are usually going to have some tableau left and then you have got the foundation
cu22tqwikio_6-5-rgb_front the way i keep score is i ignore the foundation and i add the remaining tableau to what is in the waste pile
cu22tqwikio_7-5-rgb_front so in this case it is one two three four five six seven eight plus one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
cu22tqwikio_8-5-rgb_front i have a score of twenty for this hand of pyramid
cueklcakduc_0-8-rgb_front to make our rat we are going to use air drying clay or self hardening clay
cueklcakduc_1-8-rgb_front important things about this kind of clay is that it need to be kept in a sealed container in order to stay malleable and able to use
cueklcakduc_2-8-rgb_front it will dry up really quickly
cueklcakduc_3-8-rgb_front so we want to make sure that when we are that when we are not using it
cueklcakduc_4-8-rgb_front it is wrapped up and the air is out of the bag and when we are using it we are not leaving it for long periods of time
cueklcakduc_5-8-rgb_front we also use water with this clay it is a little different from what you might use if you us if you were doing pottery or spinning on a wheel and you want when you are using this clay you will notice that the oils and the moisture from your hands are actually soaked into the clay and it starts to dry out
cueklcakduc_6-8-rgb_front so it is important to add water to this clay but not too much
cueklcakduc_7-8-rgb_front what happens when we add water is it moistures the clay but then if we add too much we get something that gets a little bit too sticky and this clay can often crack if it is not well shaped and well sculpted
cvn7htba8xc_0-8-rgb_front just like in the previous sit command i would like you to administer baiting your dog with the leave it command as well
cvn7htba8xc_1-8-rgb_front once your dog knows that they are about to have a work activity by baiting them you can then get down on your one knee
cvn7htba8xc_10-8-rgb_front good sit
cvn7htba8xc_2-8-rgb_front as i mentioned i like to lightly hold the dog is collar bait them so they know that a command is to follow
cvn7htba8xc_3-8-rgb_front i will be discussing placement of the treat or the object in an upcoming segment but i would like you to always think how baiting the dog gets the dog is attention
cvn7htba8xc_4-8-rgb_front like i also mentioned i never want a dog to assume a certain pattern of commands
cvn7htba8xc_5-8-rgb_front certainly if you go to a zoo or see a dog show they train the dog to do a series of segments
cvn7htba8xc_7-8-rgb_front good sit
cvn7htba8xc_8-8-rgb_front but as far as the leave it command or any other single commands i want the dog to know that baiting is going to be followed by a particular command
cvn7htba8xc_9-8-rgb_front up
cw66nebqw2w_0-9-rgb_front hi my name is mark breaux
cw66nebqw2w_1-9-rgb_front i have been working in men is tailored clothing for about years now and i am going to demonstrate how to tie a wider knot
cw66nebqw2w_10-9-rgb_front you start out you cross the front of the tie over and then you take a wrap around this first leg and cross around the back side and you go around this leg
cw66nebqw2w_11-9-rgb_front a lot of times with the more euro knot you do not pull this part as tight as you would with a normal business tie because you want it to be a little fuller to start with
cw66nebqw2w_12-9-rgb_front after you get that base it forms a good triangle there cross it over and up through the neck and then down through that loop
cw66nebqw2w_13-9-rgb_front and that is going to tie a wider stance knot at the top here and it is going to fill up spread collar a littler bit more and then also as far as the gage you want to gage it for the over all length of the tie
cw66nebqw2w_14-9-rgb_front it still should drop below your belt line of your trousers
cw66nebqw2w_15-9-rgb_front and that is the euro knot
cw66nebqw2w_2-9-rgb_front a lot of times it is used with a spread collar or cut away collars
cw66nebqw2w_3-9-rgb_front it gives you a wider knot
cw66nebqw2w_4-9-rgb_front it is also referred to as a euro knot
cw66nebqw2w_5-9-rgb_front first thing you want to do when you start out to tie this tie you need a tie that is a little thicker in its fabrication
cw66nebqw2w_6-9-rgb_front the liners are going to be a little heavier on the inside of the tie and make it a little heavier
cw66nebqw2w_7-9-rgb_front if you go with a traditional business tie like this it is going to be a little thinner and it is going to tie a narrower knot
cw66nebqw2w_8-9-rgb_front but to tie this knot first thing you do you want to start out and tie the full windsor which also gives you another wrap around the base of the knot and helps you get a little fuller knot
cw66nebqw2w_9-9-rgb_front first thing you have to do is you want to judge your length how much you need
cwxqvmfkj48_0-5-rgb_front hi i am johanna krynytzky and this is karen sun ray and we are here with hip expressions belly dance studio in st petersburg florida
cwxqvmfkj48_1-5-rgb_front let is work on our rocking camel
cwxqvmfkj48_10-5-rgb_front one two three four
cwxqvmfkj48_11-5-rgb_front good
cwxqvmfkj48_12-5-rgb_front now how big you want to make your camel is up to you
cwxqvmfkj48_13-5-rgb_front right
cwxqvmfkj48_14-5-rgb_front you can make it nice and big one two three four
cwxqvmfkj48_15-5-rgb_front or you can refine your camel and make it a little bit smaller three four
cwxqvmfkj48_16-5-rgb_front one two three let is speed it up a little bit four
cwxqvmfkj48_17-5-rgb_front and one two three four
cwxqvmfkj48_18-5-rgb_front one two three four
cwxqvmfkj48_19-5-rgb_front one two three very nice
cwxqvmfkj48_2-5-rgb_front now remember a camel is different from an undulation because the shoulders move with the camel an undulation stays with a confine of the body without having the shoulders move
cwxqvmfkj48_20-5-rgb_front good
cwxqvmfkj48_21-5-rgb_front excellent
cwxqvmfkj48_22-5-rgb_front that is a beautiful rocking camel
cwxqvmfkj48_3-5-rgb_front so if we put one shoulder in front of the other so right now i have my left foot in front of my right and not very far forward so we are not way out here
cwxqvmfkj48_4-5-rgb_front okay
cwxqvmfkj48_5-5-rgb_front feet together so my toes line up almost with my heel i want to bend my knees keep the belly button pulled in
cwxqvmfkj48_6-5-rgb_front as i bring the chest forward i am going to let the shoulders come forward with me and then lift the chest bring it back and roll down
cwxqvmfkj48_7-5-rgb_front so it is going to be one and two on the front foot and three and four on the back foot
cwxqvmfkj48_8-5-rgb_front one and two back on three and four
cwxqvmfkj48_9-5-rgb_front good
cx9q2gqwzco_0-8-rgb_front hi if you are looking for things to consider when you are rating a massage chair when you are thinking about buying one i can give you a few things to consider and to think about before you make your purchase
cx9q2gqwzco_1-8-rgb_front i am sundae with natural sundae
cx9q2gqwzco_10-8-rgb_front it takes a few more minutes than a chair that is made a little bit better would
cx9q2gqwzco_11-8-rgb_front out of five stars i would probably give this chair a three
cx9q2gqwzco_12-8-rgb_front so you want to make sure it is really easy to set up and that there is not too many moving parts
cx9q2gqwzco_13-8-rgb_front the third thing to consider is the padding and there are many most of the pieces on here are padded
cx9q2gqwzco_14-8-rgb_front you have got your headrest which is really padded and that is really nice you have got your chest plate you see this one moves up and down you have got your seat you have got your leg guards and you have got your hand rest your forearm rest
cx9q2gqwzco_15-8-rgb_front so you want to make sure it is got enough padding for you
cx9q2gqwzco_16-8-rgb_front and you also want to make sure it is comfortable to sit in
cx9q2gqwzco_17-8-rgb_front you want to make sure it is really comfortable and some massage chairs just are not comfortable at all and they look comfortable so you just never know
cx9q2gqwzco_18-8-rgb_front you want to sit in your chair definitely before you buy it
cx9q2gqwzco_19-8-rgb_front so those are just four quick and very simple things to consider when considering which chair to buy for your chair massage
cx9q2gqwzco_2-8-rgb_front now there are about four things that you should really keep in mind when you are purchasing a chair massage chair for massage
cx9q2gqwzco_20-8-rgb_front i am sundae with natural sundae
cx9q2gqwzco_21-8-rgb_front take it easy guys
cx9q2gqwzco_3-8-rgb_front what you want to do is you first want to think about the weight and how heavy it is
cx9q2gqwzco_4-8-rgb_front you are going to be carrying it around and you do not really want it to you do not want to hurt yourself carrying your chair around
cx9q2gqwzco_5-8-rgb_front so you want to make sure it is fairly light
cx9q2gqwzco_6-8-rgb_front you also want to make sure that it is fairly adjustable
cx9q2gqwzco_7-8-rgb_front the headrest can move this chest plate can move up and down and there are definitely lots of movable parts on the chair
cx9q2gqwzco_8-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that you know how to work your chair and that it is easy to work
cx9q2gqwzco_9-8-rgb_front for instance this chair is a little bit harder for me to set up
cxnfma-d_n8_0-1-rgb_front in this segment we will talk about how to set your tent up in the snow
cxnfma-d_n8_1-1-rgb_front in the coldest part of the winter you are certainly going to want a four season tent
cxnfma-d_n8_10-1-rgb_front this will save you a lot of grief and also be a really good way of knowing that you can set your tent up faster especially as the sun sets and it is getting cold and you would like to get that tent up
cxnfma-d_n8_11-1-rgb_front i am using snow stakes which have a little better purchase on the snow and will hold the tent a little more securely than the wire stakes that normally come with your tent
cxnfma-d_n8_12-1-rgb_front if once you set your tent you do not feel that it is still secure enough you can always try to find l rocks or large quantities of snow to set over the stakes to help anchor them in
cxnfma-d_n8_13-1-rgb_front when you are pouring out all the parts to your tent they can get lost pretty easily in the snow particularly if it is fresh powder so it is a good idea to lay down some kind of a cloth that all your stakes and miscellaneous pieces go on otherwise you will be digging for them or worse yet not be able to set your tent
cxnfma-d_n8_14-1-rgb_front i have found a couple of rocks that i can put over the stakes and that may be good enough but i am going to go a step further and cover them with snow to sort of anchor them in place and that should keep my stakes where they belong and my tent standing through the night
cxnfma-d_n8_15-1-rgb_front now the final step of course is to put your rain fly in
cxnfma-d_n8_16-1-rgb_front you will stake it out the same way and that will give you a secure tent that you will be able to rely on for the night
cxnfma-d_n8_2-1-rgb_front you can use a three season tent towards either end of the season
cxnfma-d_n8_3-1-rgb_front if you are using a three season tent it is a good idea to use a ground cloth
cxnfma-d_n8_4-1-rgb_front you will want to set your door so that it is facing your gear that makes the shortest trip between the door and your gear when you need it for convenience sake
cxnfma-d_n8_5-1-rgb_front this tent has two doors so we will not have to consider that
cxnfma-d_n8_6-1-rgb_front if you were not able to get the ground perfectly flat which is often the case you will want to consider where to put your head
cxnfma-d_n8_7-1-rgb_front it is a good idea for the head end of the tent where that is where you are going to be laying your head when you are sleeping to be on the higher ground
cxnfma-d_n8_8-1-rgb_front you will sleep better that way
cxnfma-d_n8_9-1-rgb_front now hopefully what you did before you came out here was set your tent at home so that you know for sure how it sets up and that you have all the pieces that you need
czbrbqgziuc_0-5-rgb_front okay we are going to start with the shower
czbrbqgziuc_1-5-rgb_front we are all done with the tub now
czbrbqgziuc_10-5-rgb_front lets get some water marks going right there
czbrbqgziuc_11-5-rgb_front okay now every time i take a shower
czbrbqgziuc_12-5-rgb_front you see these
czbrbqgziuc_13-5-rgb_front i do not know if you can see the water marks
czbrbqgziuc_14-5-rgb_front but every time you shower if you use the squeegee to get rid of that water on your panels there is so much less work to do when you have to come and clean your shower
czbrbqgziuc_15-5-rgb_front so from the inside lets say i have just had a shower
czbrbqgziuc_16-5-rgb_front i pick up my squeegee which is always on the floor in m tub
czbrbqgziuc_17-5-rgb_front and i just go from top to bottom and it just helps so much with stopping that buildup of water marks or calcium from the water
czbrbqgziuc_18-5-rgb_front and just go like that
czbrbqgziuc_19-5-rgb_front done
czbrbqgziuc_2-5-rgb_front hopefully you have no questions left on the tub
czbrbqgziuc_20-5-rgb_front and then obviously i did it to this side as well
czbrbqgziuc_21-5-rgb_front but it
czbrbqgziuc_22-5-rgb_front you would be amazed at how much easier it is to keep your glass clean if you just do that with no cleaning products at all
czbrbqgziuc_3-5-rgb_front its sparkly and clean
czbrbqgziuc_4-5-rgb_front there is no germs
czbrbqgziuc_5-5-rgb_front you know that its its a clean place to wash
czbrbqgziuc_6-5-rgb_front so lets move on to the shower
czbrbqgziuc_7-5-rgb_front i am going to give you an example of what i do with the squeegee
czbrbqgziuc_8-5-rgb_front every time you take a shower this is your best friend
czbrbqgziuc_9-5-rgb_front so lets get some water marks first to show you
d-ufzzklfmm_0-5-rgb_front next step with a nice even coat of media on your photocopy flip it over
d-ufzzklfmm_1-5-rgb_front take your hand and i want this thing stuck stuck stuck stuck on here
d-ufzzklfmm_10-5-rgb_front there
d-ufzzklfmm_2-5-rgb_front everything should be stuck every single surface of it no edges poking up
d-ufzzklfmm_3-5-rgb_front if they are have some media on the end of your brush gently go around like that and then there you go then press it down
d-ufzzklfmm_4-5-rgb_front now as soon as you feel you have a good seal you are not done yet because you want to put some more media
d-ufzzklfmm_5-5-rgb_front i like putting some more media on the back of the photocopy as well
d-ufzzklfmm_6-5-rgb_front some people do not do this to me actually the transfers are a little more consistent when you do
d-ufzzklfmm_7-5-rgb_front so same as last time put a bunch of dots on the back now we are going to do the same thing
d-ufzzklfmm_8-5-rgb_front nice even strokes
d-ufzzklfmm_9-5-rgb_front i prefer a bigger brush for this not like a little one otherwise you can see it can take a while and media does dry so you want to make sure you have a nice even layer on here before the drying process starts which will be about five to ten minutes after first application
d-cjhsxckcq_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is mike sanders and i am going to tell you a little bit about how to catch a wave
d-cjhsxckcq_1-8-rgb_front so once you get out in to the position that you want to be in you gotta keep in mind that the waves usually break in one place repetitively
d-cjhsxckcq_10-8-rgb_front you do not want to take off on somebody which means you know the person who is on the wave or the person who is paddling for the wave and they are closest to the peak
d-cjhsxckcq_11-8-rgb_front if the wave is crumbling like this you know breaking breaking to the right and somebody is riding the peak and you are over here and you just should not go for it
d-cjhsxckcq_12-8-rgb_front it is not your wave
d-cjhsxckcq_13-8-rgb_front it is like cutting in line
d-cjhsxckcq_14-8-rgb_front you really should not do it
d-cjhsxckcq_15-8-rgb_front but if you know the wave is there it is standing up for you it is behind you you see it turn and you want to paddle perpendicular
d-cjhsxckcq_16-8-rgb_front if the wave is moving in like this you want to paddle perpendicular with the wave
d-cjhsxckcq_17-8-rgb_front give you a steepest face and give you the most speed to take off on
d-cjhsxckcq_18-8-rgb_front another thing to keep in mind is position of your body on the board
d-cjhsxckcq_19-8-rgb_front you want to be far enough back so that the nose stays out of the water
d-cjhsxckcq_2-8-rgb_front and they are going to move in parallel more or less
d-cjhsxckcq_20-8-rgb_front you also do not you do not want to be too far back because you are pushing a lot of water if your nose is you know if here is the water and your nose is here you are like a barge pushing a whole bunch of water in the front slowing you down
d-cjhsxckcq_21-8-rgb_front it is a lot harder to paddle
d-cjhsxckcq_22-8-rgb_front paddle like you have never paddled before
d-cjhsxckcq_23-8-rgb_front i can not stress this enough
d-cjhsxckcq_24-8-rgb_front so many people will just go out there start paddling start paddling and then they will jump up on the board when the wave is ten feet behind them and they wonder why they are not catching it
d-cjhsxckcq_25-8-rgb_front you really have to wait to feel the wave pick you up
d-cjhsxckcq_26-8-rgb_front you will feel the board get turned down the wave and as it gets turned down it will drop down the wave just like a skate board goes down a hill
d-cjhsxckcq_27-8-rgb_front and as you go down you get more speed
d-cjhsxckcq_28-8-rgb_front once you feel the board moving faster than you are paddling it that is when you know you have caught the wave
d-cjhsxckcq_3-8-rgb_front well their motion is perpendicular to the beach but the waves themselves come in and here is the beach the waves are coming in like this and they are breaking each way
d-cjhsxckcq_4-8-rgb_front so what you really want to do is position yourself where the waves are about to break and you want to be there
d-cjhsxckcq_5-8-rgb_front you do not want to be around too many people
d-cjhsxckcq_6-8-rgb_front that is hard to do in places like california
d-cjhsxckcq_7-8-rgb_front but if you can you want to stay away from too many people
d-cjhsxckcq_8-8-rgb_front fortunately usually there is more people surfing at the better spots
d-cjhsxckcq_9-8-rgb_front so once you are out there in your position you are right where the waves are almost breaking but not really just kind of lifting you up and down and you see white water on the other side of them you gotta be patient you gotta wait for a wave that is coming
d-wjmwfpezc_0-5-rgb_front ok we are just about finished here

d0hkysfvgru_10-5-rgb_front red cups red dixie cups are the easiest to play with and they are the most commonly used

d1h3xlgdmey_0-8-rgb_front hi
d1h3xlgdmey_1-8-rgb_front i am maria enomota from consumer credit counseling service and today we are going to learn how to shop without having a credit card
d1h3xlgdmey_10-8-rgb_front the main difference is that if you use it as a debit card and you enter your pin number and they charge the amount the amount of this charge is going to be taken right away from your checking account
d1h3xlgdmey_11-8-rgb_front if you decide to use the same card but as a visa transaction or a credit transaction they are going to be taking the funds hours after the transaction
d1h3xlgdmey_12-8-rgb_front so that will give you some time to put some money in your check account if you do not have a set amount at that point
d1h3xlgdmey_2-8-rgb_front some people have had a bad experiences with credit cards so they want to stop using them for at least for awhile
d1h3xlgdmey_3-8-rgb_front and but they also need to know that they can buy without having a credit card
d1h3xlgdmey_4-8-rgb_front one thing that you can use is a prepaid credit card
d1h3xlgdmey_5-8-rgb_front know something that has a extend limit you put the amount that you want to carry with that and you will use a prepaid credit card to do any purchases that you may want on line or if you are going to be renting a car or renting a hotel room if you are on travel or if you want to buy groceries
d1h3xlgdmey_6-8-rgb_front that is the way you can control your expenses by using a prepaid credit card and it is not exactly as a regular credit card because the limit is set by you
d1h3xlgdmey_7-8-rgb_front if you do not want to use a prepaid credit card you can still use your debit card
d1h3xlgdmey_8-8-rgb_front if you have noticed your debit card the one that you have from the bank that is link and attached to your checking account will have a visa or master card logo
d1h3xlgdmey_9-8-rgb_front and when you buy and use that card most of the times they ask you if you want debit or credit it is because that small tiny debit card can be used as a credit card too
d4gkps6fao0_0-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to talk about a top wing
d4gkps6fao0_1-5-rgb_front this keeps the wind on the side of the wing keeping your car on all four wheels
d4gkps6fao0_2-5-rgb_front it kind of acts as a parachute so as you are going around the corner and that wind is pressing up against this side of the wing and keeping you from tipping over and it causes you to go faster around the corner without letting up without using the brakes so much
d4gkps6fao0_3-5-rgb_front so these are very important to racing and sprint car racing especially
d4gkps6fao0_4-5-rgb_front the top wing is adjustable
d4gkps6fao0_5-5-rgb_front the front wing is not adjustable
d7agobq8bmw_0-8-rgb_front hi
d7agobq8bmw_10-8-rgb_front do not nap for too long because then it will actually drain you do not nap for anymore than an hour set your alarm and just lye down try to relax and even a short nap will do wonders for you
d7agobq8bmw_11-8-rgb_front if you have a disjointed schedule let is say you are a musician like me and you are traveling around a lot then it is difficult to get enough sleep
d7agobq8bmw_12-8-rgb_front you really have to force yourself to sit down and not do something do not go out even though you may be tempted to do it call it a night and relax
d7agobq8bmw_13-8-rgb_front because if you do not you are going to wake up around thinking oh god i wish i could sleep till noon and you do not always have that luxury
d7agobq8bmw_14-8-rgb_front people who do not get enough sleep are at much higher risk of catching a cold because it makes them very stressed out and their body is as strong anymore
d7agobq8bmw_15-8-rgb_front so get enough sleep as you possibly can work it into your schedule even at the point of cutting out social things and you will find you will be getting sick much less often
d7agobq8bmw_2-8-rgb_front now resting is one of the best ways of preventing and treating a cold should you catch one
d7agobq8bmw_3-8-rgb_front sleep helps you prevent a cold in a variety of ways
d7agobq8bmw_4-8-rgb_front first of all it boosts your immune system secondly it recharges your body which means you are going to perform at peak capacity
d7agobq8bmw_5-8-rgb_front sleep also reduces stress which can be a major cause of a cold
d7agobq8bmw_6-8-rgb_front so getting enough sleep is very important but actually doing it can be very difficult
d7agobq8bmw_7-8-rgb_front any busy person knows that you can not always get as many hours of sleep as you want but one thing that you can do is try to put yourself on a set sleep schedule
d7agobq8bmw_8-8-rgb_front force yourself to be in bed by a certain time no matter what maybe it is midnight maybe it is pm but make sure that you at least get hours of sleep per night
d7agobq8bmw_9-8-rgb_front if it turns out that you missed sleep because you are on a mixed up schedule then what you should do is try to take a nap in the afternoon
d7znbqalscs_0-5-rgb_front hi
d7znbqalscs_2-5-rgb_front there many of us that enjoy a drink now and again but drinking too much will actually make us venerable to catching colds
d7znbqalscs_3-5-rgb_front so what does alcohol do that actually makes you venerable to catching a cold
d7znbqalscs_4-5-rgb_front well one thing that it does is that it dehydrates you
d7znbqalscs_5-5-rgb_front water helps you get toxins out of your systems so you do not want to be dehydrated
d7znbqalscs_6-5-rgb_front the other thing that alcohol does is clog up your filtering systems in your body
d7znbqalscs_7-5-rgb_front our body has these natural offenses meant to push toxins out and alcohol is something that you body wants to get rid of
d7znbqalscs_8-5-rgb_front so if your body is busy getting rid of alcohol then it is not going to have the resources to get rid of the germs that are going to cause a cold
d7svdyzqjqk_1-5-rgb_front now we have already mentioned before about not being a pack rat as far as pulling stuff out now that you already have it in a garage sale you have got to make a real decision as to what are you going to get rid of and do not be a pack rat
d7svdyzqjqk_2-5-rgb_front you are going to have to put this stuff back up you are going to have to organize it you want to get it out of there and you want to sell it
d7svdyzqjqk_3-5-rgb_front if you want to make money on a garage sale and we often times my sister will make on a garage sale because she is really willing to go out there to put as much as she can out there and to put it within reasonable price
d7svdyzqjqk_4-5-rgb_front if things truly are valuable then do not under cut yourself
d7svdyzqjqk_5-5-rgb_front she would put it maybe a little more than i would ever put in a garage sale but then she sells it and she made on a garage sale
d7svdyzqjqk_6-5-rgb_front be willing to realize make a conscious effort to know that i have to put all this stuff back up
d7svdyzqjqk_7-5-rgb_front if it is stuff that is going to be sitting out at next years garage sale and you are not going use it in between then try to get rid of it
d7svdyzqjqk_8-5-rgb_front put it out display it try to talk to people
d7svdyzqjqk_9-5-rgb_front if you see somebody interested negotiate keep going down until they want till it is cheap enough that they really really want it
dbipltg0s5k_1-8-rgb_front what we want to talk about now is making the appropriate catch on the kick off or the return
dbipltg0s5k_10-8-rgb_front if this guy is left handed he wants to catch it more to the left side so he can tuck the ball away and step out of the end zone
dbipltg0s5k_11-8-rgb_front or he wants to catch it on the right side so he is on that dominant side
dbipltg0s5k_12-8-rgb_front also when you catch it catch it nice and soft
dbipltg0s5k_13-8-rgb_front you do not want to catch it with concrete hands
dbipltg0s5k_14-8-rgb_front this is what it looks like when he receives the kick video demo
dbipltg0s5k_15-8-rgb_front you see he catches it he has good balance and then he explodes out after making the good catch
dbipltg0s5k_16-8-rgb_front that is the proper way to do it
dbipltg0s5k_2-8-rgb_front we want to focus on when the ball is kicked and the ball is above you what are the proper ways to get yourself set in order to receive the kick off
dbipltg0s5k_3-8-rgb_front what we want to talk about first is that balance
dbipltg0s5k_4-8-rgb_front you never want to be coming up on a ball and have to catch it out in front of you
dbipltg0s5k_5-8-rgb_front you always want to catch the ball standing underneath the ball where you have good balance
dbipltg0s5k_6-8-rgb_front you also never want to be catching the ball on your back foot going backward when you receive the ball
dbipltg0s5k_7-8-rgb_front the other important thing to remember is when the ball is coming in to you you always want to catch the ball to one side or the other
dbipltg0s5k_8-8-rgb_front you do not want to receive the ball in the middle and let it hit you in the middle of the chest
dbipltg0s5k_9-8-rgb_front typically you will see those hit and bounce off and you will make a bad catch
dc0nsp_kiw4_0-8-rgb_front this is nigel gregory with blue griffin handyman and we are going to show you how to paint a straight line
dc0nsp_kiw4_1-8-rgb_front now when working with paint if it is not low voc or no voc type paint you want to remember to wear safety precautions and wear your face mask to protect you from the fumes in the paint during and after you are done painting until it is completely dry
dc0nsp_kiw4_2_3-8-rgb_front now there are several ways to get a straight line they have got these neat brushes out there that have rollers on them and so you just press these rollers up against the molding that you are working with or a board that you attach to the wall and you just paint along like so
dc0nsp_kiw4_4_5-8-rgb_front remove the board and then you have a straight line here another way you can do it is if you just have some tape and a brush this tape here is low stick and it will not pull the paint that is existing on the wall off so you take a strip of it and pull it fairly tight and put it on the wall or the board or surface that you are going to paint
dc0nsp_kiw4_6-8-rgb_front make sure that it is down on the surface really good and it sticks well and then take your brush and paint right down the middle of it or so so that you get a nice line a nice good amount of paint a good coating on there
dc0nsp_kiw4_7-8-rgb_front you may have to go over it two or three times but then what you want to do is allow that to dry just a little bit because sometimes the paint can bead at the edge of the tape but for demonstration purposes i am going to go ahead and pull it up and see if we can get a good straight line off of this and notice how you have a good straight line with the paint there
dc0nsp_kiw4_8-8-rgb_front those are just a couple of ways of getting a good straight line with paint
deimfsuetwk_1-5-rgb_front you can find me in new york city and today i am going to teach you how to play a saw
deimfsuetwk_10-5-rgb_front some kneel down this way
deimfsuetwk_11-5-rgb_front whatever way you decide to hold your saw it does not matter
deimfsuetwk_12-5-rgb_front the sound production method is the same it is just a different stance
deimfsuetwk_2-5-rgb_front there are many ways to hold the saw while playing
deimfsuetwk_3-5-rgb_front the most prevalent way is to sit down place the handle between your knees and clasp your knees together so that the blade will not slip through
deimfsuetwk_4-5-rgb_front if you are right handed then you hold the tip of the blade with your left hand
deimfsuetwk_5-5-rgb_front this is the most popular stance
deimfsuetwk_6-5-rgb_front however some people play standing up
deimfsuetwk_7-5-rgb_front you hold the saw in the same manner but you stand up
deimfsuetwk_8-5-rgb_front some people mostly i found switzerland play the saw kneeling down
deimfsuetwk_9-5-rgb_front again you hold the handle between your knees but you are kneeling down

dfahc--tlxq_0-5-rgb_front if you are massaging your own horse who is of a fairly calm stoic sort of a nature there is some real benefits to that
dfahc--tlxq_1-5-rgb_front but there is some disadvantages also
dfahc--tlxq_2-5-rgb_front you can find yourself kind of lulled into a false sense of security
dfahc--tlxq_3-5-rgb_front a calm horse may not let you know as readily as a more sensitive horse when something does not feel good to them
dfahc--tlxq_4-5-rgb_front they may be willing to tolerate a lot more from you then a more nervous or flighty horse would
dfahc--tlxq_5-5-rgb_front so that makes it equally important to not take them for granted to pay close attention to what you are doing and close attention to how they are reacting
dfahc--tlxq_6-5-rgb_front a calm horse may show you in much more subtle ways that you need to back off or that you need to move from one area to another
dfahc--tlxq_7-5-rgb_front there maybe less movement of the ears or less movement of their mouth as they are licking and chewing they may not sigh and drop their head
dfahc--tlxq_8-5-rgb_front they may just kind of stand there in more or less one position the entire time that you are working on them
dfahc--tlxq_9-5-rgb_front so pay attention to your horse and again know the horse that you are working with and know their likes and dislikes
dgi7tibyfis_0-5-rgb_front ben graham every kid can play baseball
dgi7tibyfis_1-5-rgb_front it is a very simple game
dgi7tibyfis_10-5-rgb_front you can play baseball in your backyard
dgi7tibyfis_11-5-rgb_front you can pick up a stick and hit a rock or a pine cone around which most of us have done at some point or another in our lives
dgi7tibyfis_12-5-rgb_front again baseball is very easily accessible very open to everyone who has willingness and a very basic skill set
dgi7tibyfis_13-5-rgb_front in this series of videos we will go through some more advanced skill sets
dgi7tibyfis_14-5-rgb_front but always remember baseball is a very simple game every kid can play
dgi7tibyfis_2-5-rgb_front it is very intricately woven into the history of the united states and our american culture
dgi7tibyfis_3-5-rgb_front and i think the reason that it is is because it is a very accessible game
dgi7tibyfis_4-5-rgb_front it is not a game that you need to be seven feet tall to play
dgi7tibyfis_5-5-rgb_front you do not need to be pounds
dgi7tibyfis_6-5-rgb_front you do not need to run a
dgi7tibyfis_7-5-rgb_front you have to have a very basic skill set to play the game of baseball
dgi7tibyfis_8-5-rgb_front if you can pick a ball if you can throw that ball if you can hit that ball and you can catch that ball you can play baseball
dgi7tibyfis_9-5-rgb_front baseball is played all over the united states and all over the world really with very simple equipment very simple people exercising a very simple skill set
dh0pisptiug_0-8-rgb_front now we are going to be talking about tennis balls a very important part of tennis
dh0pisptiug_1-8-rgb_front i am going to give you an example of a good tennis ball
dh0pisptiug_10-8-rgb_front you want to have a tennis cap to protect you from the sun
dh0pisptiug_11-8-rgb_front you want to make sure you put sunscreen to protect you from the sun
dh0pisptiug_12-8-rgb_front you want to make sure you have pants or skirt where you can put your balls
dh0pisptiug_13-8-rgb_front for example today i have a skirt that is also a it has pants and it has a skirt so i can actually put my ball inside a small pocket that is right here
dh0pisptiug_14-8-rgb_front there you go tennis ball in there
dh0pisptiug_15-8-rgb_front that is really going to help me because when i am going to be serving i am going to be serving with two balls because you have a first serve and a second serve
dh0pisptiug_16-8-rgb_front you do not want to be leaving the ball on the floor because you can step on it and you do not want to be tossing with two balls in your hand because you are not going to have a good toss
dh0pisptiug_17-8-rgb_front so you want to make sure you have pants or a place where to put your balls
dh0pisptiug_18-8-rgb_front that is concludes a little clip about balls
dh0pisptiug_2-8-rgb_front this would be a decent tennis ball
dh0pisptiug_3-8-rgb_front it has hair you can see the logo of it pretty clear
dh0pisptiug_4-8-rgb_front this would be an example of a bad tennis ball
dh0pisptiug_5-8-rgb_front the ball is almost pretty much gone you can see the logo is almost gone the yellow color of it is also gone and most important you can squeeze it and it is almost going to go all the way down as you can see right here
dh0pisptiug_6-8-rgb_front when a good tennis ball you can squeeze it but it will stay firm on your hand
dh0pisptiug_7-8-rgb_front where to place your tennis balls
dh0pisptiug_8-8-rgb_front that is a very important question
dh0pisptiug_9-8-rgb_front i will bet all of you are going to be serving and that is where your outfit comes in
dihovhzskug_1-8-rgb_front when you apply tip you want to make sure you get each nail to make sure size there are and the size of the nail corresponds to and is the largest so this looks like a
dihovhzskug_10-8-rgb_front you want to avoid having anything that over flows the nail and on to the skin
dihovhzskug_11-8-rgb_front again this is tight we just swivel it and that is a example in applying the tips on your real nails
dihovhzskug_2-8-rgb_front so we pick out a and apply it okay it is about the right size
dihovhzskug_3-8-rgb_front when you apply nails make sure you use nail glue super glue does not work it will lift the nail and you client would have a fungus because of the moisture
dihovhzskug_4-8-rgb_front when you apply the nails make sure that the fake nails which is the tips is in lined with the real nails so it will not be crooked it when you put it on
dihovhzskug_5-8-rgb_front absorb some pressure hold it for about a minute and then check it i swivel it a little bit and it is on tight
dihovhzskug_6-8-rgb_front the next nail you have to make sure sometimes people are they use there pencil or some tools that pushes against the nail so it pulls the nail and goes to the left or to the right
dihovhzskug_7-8-rgb_front you want to make sure that nail is straight and if it does goes to the left you want to put the acyclic nail to the right
dihovhzskug_8-8-rgb_front so again you apply pressure do not put to much glue to much glue it would leak over to the side of the nail and on to the skin
dihovhzskug_9-8-rgb_front it will irritate the skin sometimes burns and also sometimes when you put on the acrylic and the glue is over the skin water can get in
dj3lnqaocv4_0-8-rgb_front in this clip we will be evaluating the clients hair texture and type
dj3lnqaocv4_1-8-rgb_front that is totally important for the end result
dj3lnqaocv4_10-8-rgb_front his hair is relatively fine but it is very thick and has that very straight direction to it so there is absolutely no bend and because of that he basically has two choices
dj3lnqaocv4_11-8-rgb_front he either needs to grow his hair out a little bit longer so that the weight will actually keep this growth pattern in check and keep the hair down or he needs to take it considerably shorter so that as the hair pokes out which it is going to do it is doing so in a shape that is acceptable
dj3lnqaocv4_2-8-rgb_front often times the client will come in and they will be requesting a particular hair cut or a particular hairstyle and their hair texture just will not work for that
dj3lnqaocv4_3-8-rgb_front the best way to do that is to actually get your hands into the hair and feel what is going on
dj3lnqaocv4_4-8-rgb_front when your hands are in there you can feel the texture the density
dj3lnqaocv4_5-8-rgb_front at this time at this time it is also a good opportunity to analyze if there are any colics in the particular clients hair
dj3lnqaocv4_6-8-rgb_front a colic is a growth pattern where the hair swirls in a particular direction
dj3lnqaocv4_7-8-rgb_front it is very important to be aware of that before you begin the cut
dj3lnqaocv4_8-8-rgb_front typically in those areas if the cut is taken too short the hair is going to stick straight out
dj3lnqaocv4_9-8-rgb_front on our particular clients hair today we can see that his growth pattern is such that it wants to stick straight out
djkzc7ichgs_0-1-rgb_front the next thing that we are going to cover in our introductory lesson after we get done the stretching is going to be jump roping
djkzc7ichgs_1-1-rgb_front some of the boxers come in and they know how to jump rope already and a lot of them do not
djkzc7ichgs_10-1-rgb_front give me that jump rope
djkzc7ichgs_11-1-rgb_front so they hand me the jump rope and i say you know how to learn how to jump rope
djkzc7ichgs_12-1-rgb_front the best way to learn how to jump rope you take your jump rope and then you set it aside
djkzc7ichgs_13-1-rgb_front okay
djkzc7ichgs_14-1-rgb_front you just set it off to the side
djkzc7ichgs_15-1-rgb_front make believe you have a jump rope
djkzc7ichgs_16-1-rgb_front what we are going to do is as you are making a believe jump roping your wrists are going down we are going to bend at the wrist
djkzc7ichgs_17-1-rgb_front do not bend with your full arms and do not jump up a foot off the ground that is just torquing your body
djkzc7ichgs_18-1-rgb_front it is just wasting a lot of energy
djkzc7ichgs_19-1-rgb_front we are going to jump an inch off the floor
djkzc7ichgs_2-1-rgb_front a lot of them have not jump roped since they were a kid and that is fine
djkzc7ichgs_20-1-rgb_front we are just going to revolve our wrists a little bit
djkzc7ichgs_21-1-rgb_front just make believe you have got a jump rope that is the best way to learn
djkzc7ichgs_22-1-rgb_front you can practice on one foot on the other foot but just make believe
djkzc7ichgs_23-1-rgb_front okay
djkzc7ichgs_24-1-rgb_front now nick here is going to show us a little bit on how he jump ropes
djkzc7ichgs_25-1-rgb_front that is a knot in there
djkzc7ichgs_27-1-rgb_front well that is a good start
djkzc7ichgs_28-1-rgb_front next we will start on hand wrapping
djkzc7ichgs_3-1-rgb_front what we like to say is a good jump roper makes a good boxer and a good boxer makes a good jump roper
djkzc7ichgs_4-1-rgb_front so jump ropes come in all different styles and lengths and thicknesses and textures
djkzc7ichgs_5-1-rgb_front this one here happens to be what we call a speed rope
djkzc7ichgs_6-1-rgb_front it is a light nylon type thing with some good swivels
djkzc7ichgs_7-1-rgb_front they have also got some heavier leather ones with some good heavy weighted handles
djkzc7ichgs_8-1-rgb_front but what i usually tell people is if you have never jumped rope before i try to let them have a go at it
djkzc7ichgs_9-1-rgb_front i can see them over in a corner and they are trying their best and they are jumping really high and they are winging that thing over and this and that and i say hold on stop a minute
dpdiwklsjbw_0-2-rgb_front hi name is john stewart and this is how to find north with or without a compass
dpdiwklsjbw_1-2-rgb_front if you are trying to find north you can do it many different ways
dpdiwklsjbw_10-2-rgb_front true north points directly north and magnetic north is going to be off just a little
dpdiwklsjbw_11-2-rgb_front magnetic north is going to point towards your north poles and your south poles on the globe okay
dpdiwklsjbw_12-2-rgb_front but maps are set up to use true north unless you are right on an agnotic line and at that point it is going to use magnetic north
dpdiwklsjbw_13-2-rgb_front but these are the many different ways you can find north
dpdiwklsjbw_2-2-rgb_front you can do it using a compass just find a compass match the red arrows up and you are going to walk north
dpdiwklsjbw_3-2-rgb_front if you do not happen to have a compass you can do this several other ways
dpdiwklsjbw_4-2-rgb_front you can find a tree with moss on it moss always grows on the south side so walk the other side
dpdiwklsjbw_5-2-rgb_front you can do this at night by using the north star find the north star and that is going to lead you the way
dpdiwklsjbw_6-2-rgb_front other ways you can do this is watch the sun rise and set the sun rises in the east sets in the west so if you can be up at those hours it will help you guide and find north or south
dpdiwklsjbw_7-2-rgb_front if you can not do that you can find it other ways
dpdiwklsjbw_8-2-rgb_front true north and magnetic north they are very similar they are very few degrees separate these
dpdiwklsjbw_9-2-rgb_front but most maps are set up to use true north
dr5u_nenx18_0-5-rgb_front hi if you are interested in how massage can help the elderly population i can definitely tell you that it can i am sundae with natural sundae
dr5u_nenx18_1-5-rgb_front now when people think of massage therapy they generally think of the traditional form of massage therapy that uses pressure well obviously this is not going to work for the elderly population they are very frail and according to what kind of condition they have it is not really going to be appropriate
dr5u_nenx18_2-5-rgb_front so the kind of massage that is gentle enough for the elderly population is called compassionate touch
dr5u_nenx18_3-5-rgb_front and more than just a regular massage this is just a holding and warming of the joints using the warmth of your body and the warmth you create as a person and your energy to help that elderly person
dr5u_nenx18_4-5-rgb_front and mainly besides just the warming and the holding of the joints it can help make them feel loved and wanted
dr5u_nenx18_5-5-rgb_front i know a lot of elderly people who do not really have any family nobody comes to visit them and showing that they are still important and connected to this world and people still care about them is sometimes even more effective than the physical aspect of massage
dr5u_nenx18_6-5-rgb_front so massage is definitely helpful for the elderly and i would recommend any massage therapist if you have a free day a week go to a local home where there are elderly people alone and just show them that they are still loved and cared for and that they are important and they do matter
dr5u_nenx18_7-5-rgb_front so that is why i am so passionate about massage for the elderly i thing it is very very important and i hope you do too
dr5u_nenx18_8-5-rgb_front i am sundae with natural sundae take care
ds9mmxiunkq_0-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to go ahead and start putting in all of our dinosaur themed items
ds9mmxiunkq_1-5-rgb_front i went down to my favorite discount store and i found a bunch of dinosaur things
ds9mmxiunkq_10-5-rgb_front this is a very easy read and it is a picture bible so little kids will have patience sitting through it
ds9mmxiunkq_11-5-rgb_front and then this is just a little coloring a little poster coloring set with markers and dinosaur as you can see
ds9mmxiunkq_12-5-rgb_front put that there
ds9mmxiunkq_13-5-rgb_front and a poster with some glasses
ds9mmxiunkq_14-5-rgb_front and i think i am going to put that right there
ds9mmxiunkq_15-5-rgb_front and these little guys
ds9mmxiunkq_16-5-rgb_front these are little plastic dinosaur
ds9mmxiunkq_17-5-rgb_front boys love these
ds9mmxiunkq_18-5-rgb_front and there are going to go right there
ds9mmxiunkq_19-5-rgb_front and then to round it off some dinosaur stickers
ds9mmxiunkq_2-5-rgb_front i totally lucked out
ds9mmxiunkq_20-5-rgb_front and these are actually hologram stickers
ds9mmxiunkq_21-5-rgb_front i do not know if you can see but they are really kind of they are cool they are very cool
ds9mmxiunkq_22_23-5-rgb_front so i am going to put those right there and there we have our dinosaur themed books and little paraphernalia and when we come back i am going to show you how to embellish it even more with some more treats
ds9mmxiunkq_3-5-rgb_front i was very excited about it
ds9mmxiunkq_4-5-rgb_front a dinosaur coloring book
ds9mmxiunkq_5-5-rgb_front i loved getting these when i was little on easter
ds9mmxiunkq_6-5-rgb_front and this one even comes with its own crayons
ds9mmxiunkq_7-5-rgb_front it s very cute
ds9mmxiunkq_8-5-rgb_front so i am going to put that there
ds9mmxiunkq_9-5-rgb_front and then in keeping with the spirit of easter i like to give bibles children is bibles when i am creating easter baskets for kids
dt5xm3lfdbo_0-5-rgb_front in any yoga practice you can build internal heat and start to get slightly overheated just like any workout
dt5xm3lfdbo_1-5-rgb_front so it is important to know how to do cooling breath to keep yourself centered and keep you focus on the rest of your practice
dt5xm3lfdbo_10-5-rgb_front and some people can not roll their tongue it is just a genetic difference
dt5xm3lfdbo_11-5-rgb_front but if you can roll your tongue a nice way to do this is roll the tongue and breath out through the tongue like a straw
dt5xm3lfdbo_12-5-rgb_front so take a nice inhale in
dt5xm3lfdbo_13-5-rgb_front if you can not roll the tongue another alternative inhale through the nose and when you exhale just let the tongue falls slightly out of the mouth and breath out of the mouth letting out the internal heat
dt5xm3lfdbo_14-5-rgb_front and these are two great ways to cool yourself throughout the practice and find more focus
dt5xm3lfdbo_2-5-rgb_front there is two ways you can do this
dt5xm3lfdbo_3-5-rgb_front one is holding the breath
dt5xm3lfdbo_4-5-rgb_front so take a nice breath in and you could hold it for several seconds maybe a count of two or three
dt5xm3lfdbo_5-5-rgb_front and then a nice breath out
dt5xm3lfdbo_6-5-rgb_front and repeat this several times
dt5xm3lfdbo_7-5-rgb_front so i could do it with you inhale in and hold your breath and exhale and release the breath and let everything go
dt5xm3lfdbo_8-5-rgb_front this will slow the heart rate and it will also bring you back to center
dt5xm3lfdbo_9-5-rgb_front the other cooling breath is through a rolled tongue
dwfnzu-ofzw_0-8-rgb_front o k now i have all my napkins separated
dwfnzu-ofzw_1-8-rgb_front i am just going to push aside the four corners out of the way but keep them where their going to be placed and we will work on one corner at a time
dwfnzu-ofzw_10-8-rgb_front and you can see that the napkin was translucent there and you do see the patterns but because we have made a cut and kind of softened the cut you do not notice it at all
dwfnzu-ofzw_11-8-rgb_front and then you want to glaze over with the decoupage glue
dwfnzu-ofzw_12-8-rgb_front now when your glazing over you want to be very careful that you have plenty of glue on your finger and you just work very delicately because the napkin is so thin it is like a piece of tissue paper and when you wet it with the glue it is a wet piece of tissue paper so it is very very delicate
dwfnzu-ofzw_13-8-rgb_front and you want to work very gently with it
dwfnzu-ofzw_14-8-rgb_front and just make sure that your finger is always slick with glue and do not let that glue dry out while you are working on it
dwfnzu-ofzw_15-8-rgb_front just glaze that over
dwfnzu-ofzw_2-8-rgb_front i like to do my decoupage by first putting a thin layer of the decoupage glue down first and then adding more glue over after
dwfnzu-ofzw_3_4-8-rgb_front so the first one is easy you start it in the corner and place it carefully on the glue and then just pat that down on the glue o k and then do that go all the way around
dwfnzu-ofzw_5-8-rgb_front now you can also go ahead and put the top glue on first before you work on your next corner or you can go and do all the corners and then put your glazing glue on the top
dwfnzu-ofzw_6-8-rgb_front o k now i will show you how to join the two corners again you want to put a very thin layer of the decoupage glue and work fast so it does not dry before you are finished
dwfnzu-ofzw_7-8-rgb_front and again you want to start at the corner and work your way down to the where it is joined o k place that down and then just pat the napkin in place
dwfnzu-ofzw_8_9-8-rgb_front now it is o k if the napkin wrinkles a bit it gives it a little bit of an antiquey look and pat that in place
dxaq76wsgr4_0-5-rgb_front we are going to talk now about how to set a traditional tip up to avoid wind flags
dxaq76wsgr4_1-5-rgb_front and i do not know if you can see the wind blowing right now but it is gusting pretty good about miles per hour
dxaq76wsgr4_2-5-rgb_front we have already had a couple of wind flags today
dxaq76wsgr4_3-5-rgb_front and essentially what that is is the wind comes in and blows the flag enough to trip it so you run over thinking you have a fish and there is nothing there and there is nothing more frustrating than that
dxaq76wsgr4_4-5-rgb_front so there is a good method for doing that though to avoid these wind flags
dxaq76wsgr4_5-5-rgb_front so the wind right now is coming from this direction right at me right at my right side so what i am going to do i am going to hook this flag in there and then i am going to switch this tip up around again being careful to stay out the way in case it flips up
dxaq76wsgr4_6-5-rgb_front now the wind is actually bringing it closer to the tripping mechanism so it is not going to trip from the wind the only way it is going to trip now and that flag is going to go up is if we actually have a fish on the line
dzztn9ewuzo_0-5-rgb_front the next move i am going to show you is called pistol hips
dzztn9ewuzo_1-5-rgb_front again you want to make sure you are in proper posture
dzztn9ewuzo_10-5-rgb_front bring one knee out and down a little further
dzztn9ewuzo_11-5-rgb_front then the other knee
dzztn9ewuzo_12-5-rgb_front knee
dzztn9ewuzo_13-5-rgb_front knee
dzztn9ewuzo_14-5-rgb_front knee
dzztn9ewuzo_15-5-rgb_front knee
dzztn9ewuzo_16-5-rgb_front knee
dzztn9ewuzo_17-5-rgb_front again the knee is dropping down and out
dzztn9ewuzo_18-5-rgb_front down and out
dzztn9ewuzo_19-5-rgb_front down and out
dzztn9ewuzo_2-5-rgb_front and for this one i find it a little bit easier if you sink a little bit more down into your knees
dzztn9ewuzo_20-5-rgb_front down and out
dzztn9ewuzo_21-5-rgb_front now while you are doing that when the hip comes out you want to squeeze your butt
dzztn9ewuzo_22-5-rgb_front so drop squeeze
dzztn9ewuzo_23-5-rgb_front squeeze
dzztn9ewuzo_24-5-rgb_front squeeze
dzztn9ewuzo_25-5-rgb_front squeeze
dzztn9ewuzo_26-5-rgb_front squeeze
dzztn9ewuzo_27-5-rgb_front squeeze
dzztn9ewuzo_28-5-rgb_front squeeze
dzztn9ewuzo_29-5-rgb_front squeeze
dzztn9ewuzo_3-5-rgb_front usually about this stance for your proper stance for this one
dzztn9ewuzo_30-5-rgb_front squeeze
dzztn9ewuzo_31-5-rgb_front this is called your pistol hips
dzztn9ewuzo_32-5-rgb_front what you can do is you can pick up the pace
dzztn9ewuzo_33-5-rgb_front drop
dzztn9ewuzo_34-5-rgb_front drop
dzztn9ewuzo_35-5-rgb_front drop
dzztn9ewuzo_36-5-rgb_front drop
dzztn9ewuzo_37-5-rgb_front drop
dzztn9ewuzo_38-5-rgb_front drop
dzztn9ewuzo_39-5-rgb_front make sure you are squeezing
dzztn9ewuzo_4-5-rgb_front sunk down a little bit more into your knees
dzztn9ewuzo_40-5-rgb_front this is your pistol hips
dzztn9ewuzo_5-5-rgb_front what i do is let one hip go then the other hip
dzztn9ewuzo_6-5-rgb_front one hip and the other hip
dzztn9ewuzo_7-5-rgb_front and how you get this is i drop one hip at the knee
dzztn9ewuzo_8-5-rgb_front the knee comes out a little bit further than the other knee
dzztn9ewuzo_9-5-rgb_front and then the other knee
d_cjxrkuy7m_0-5-rgb_front all right now let is talk about my favorite topic cell phones
d_cjxrkuy7m_1-5-rgb_front now i would like to say that in business meetings in business meals in business anything turn it off
d_cjxrkuy7m_2-5-rgb_front and then that would be the end of the clips on the cell phone but i know that it does not exactly work that way
d_cjxrkuy7m_3-5-rgb_front if at all possible turn your cell phone off
d_cjxrkuy7m_4-5-rgb_front anything that is going on out there surely people can leave you a message
d_cjxrkuy7m_5-5-rgb_front however i understand that sometimes there are certain circumstances in which you really really really need to take a call
d_cjxrkuy7m_6-5-rgb_front so you need to leave your cell phone on
d_cjxrkuy7m_7-5-rgb_front if that is the case the first thing you want to do at the beginning of the meeting at the beginning of the lunch or dinner is let people know that you have had to leave you have to leave your cell phone on that you are expecting an emergency phone call
d_cjxrkuy7m_8-5-rgb_front you do not have to go into detail but just let people know that your cell phone might be ringing
dam5gdktjau_0-8-rgb_front i am ivan madar
dam5gdktjau_10-8-rgb_front when traversing a hill make sure you are looking and your body is turned towards your next turn and you are lifting the ski with your heel up so that you are not leaning backwards
dam5gdktjau_11-8-rgb_front it is not this type of motion that would put you back
dam5gdktjau_12-8-rgb_front so your knees are flexed pressing against your shins and lifting your heel
dam5gdktjau_2-8-rgb_front okay now the first drill i am going to show you is how to make a turn on the outside ski
dam5gdktjau_3-8-rgb_front all you do is start the turn with the outside ski and lift the inside ski up
dam5gdktjau_4-8-rgb_front this is how it looks
dam5gdktjau_5-8-rgb_front so we just learned how to transfer weight from one ski to the other
dam5gdktjau_6-8-rgb_front the next drill would be traversing the slope and maintaining weight on a downhill ski making sure you can balance yourself over the downhill ski edge
dam5gdktjau_7-8-rgb_front now that is called a traverse practicing drill
dam5gdktjau_8-8-rgb_front you are practicing to stand on your downhill ski balancing your body over the downhill ski and lifting the ski just to make sure that all your weight is on your downhill ski
dam5gdktjau_9-8-rgb_front it becomes important later in maintaining your balance
dapjwylv64w_0-8-rgb_front the submarine pitch is not so much as pitch as it is an arm angle
dapjwylv64w_1-8-rgb_front all pitches the fastball change up curve knuckle ball any of these pitches can be thrown in a submarine manner and basically what they mean by submarine pitch or a submarine pitcher is the ball is thrown from a position that is less than degrees from the ground
dapjwylv64w_2-8-rgb_front it is thrown in this position
dapjwylv64w_3-8-rgb_front so all of the pitches for a submarine pitch or all the pitches for a submarine pitcher are thrown almost in an underhanded manner
dapjwylv64w_4-8-rgb_front submarine pitchers can be very effective because the ball comes from a strange direction at a strange angle and for one or two innings submarine pitchers can be very very effective
dapjwylv64w_5-8-rgb_front also because the ball is being thrown severely from the side it creates a larger angle which makes it more difficult for some batters to hit and that is a submarine pitcher and a submarine pitch
darv50mh6vc_0-8-rgb_front we are here with daisy today to talk about removing ear wax from a cat is ear
darv50mh6vc_1-8-rgb_front now there is various reasons that a cat will get ear wax
darv50mh6vc_10-8-rgb_front the outside of the ear you really want to get that because it can get some build up there
darv50mh6vc_11-8-rgb_front these little crevices back here oh yes she is being such a good girl
darv50mh6vc_12-8-rgb_front daisy is an incredibly well behaved cat and i am not even having to scruff her
darv50mh6vc_13-8-rgb_front which is great
darv50mh6vc_14-8-rgb_front alright with a cat that is a little less cooperative you see this loose loose skin right here at the back of the neck
darv50mh6vc_15-8-rgb_front you can just scruff that
darv50mh6vc_16-8-rgb_front it is a great way to hold this cat secure you can sort of press down a little bit keep them flat against the the sink the towel is really nice or against the counter
darv50mh6vc_17-8-rgb_front the towel is nice to give them something to put their nails into something if it will make them feel secure
darv50mh6vc_18-8-rgb_front and it keeps your counter clean
darv50mh6vc_19-8-rgb_front and we are going to come over here and do the other side
darv50mh6vc_2-8-rgb_front mites can be a big one
darv50mh6vc_20-8-rgb_front there you go sweety
darv50mh6vc_21-8-rgb_front how is that
darv50mh6vc_22-8-rgb_front oh not a whole lot going on today
darv50mh6vc_23-8-rgb_front now for some cats the easiest thing to do is swaddle them in the towel
darv50mh6vc_24-8-rgb_front i would not do this with a cat that you do not know well
darv50mh6vc_25-8-rgb_front but for one of your own cats it can help them feel more secure and it can also keep them from using their little claws to to try and fight anything you are doing that they do not like
darv50mh6vc_26-8-rgb_front so you just want to get in here and clean around
darv50mh6vc_27-8-rgb_front you really do not want to go any deeper than where your finger will reach because you do not want to damage their ear their eardrum
darv50mh6vc_28-8-rgb_front and a just nice gentle massaging motion
darv50mh6vc_29-8-rgb_front hopefully it could actually the thing that is amazing about cat grooming is it can actually be pleasurable for the cat if you take the right attitude
darv50mh6vc_3-8-rgb_front fungus can be another
darv50mh6vc_30-8-rgb_front does not that feel good
darv50mh6vc_31-8-rgb_front does not that feel nice and clean
darv50mh6vc_32-8-rgb_front oh are not you a good kitty daisy
darv50mh6vc_33-8-rgb_front yeah and look your ears are so pretty
darv50mh6vc_4-8-rgb_front mites usually they look a little bit like coffee grounds that have accumulated in the cat is ear
darv50mh6vc_5-8-rgb_front a a fungus will have kind of a yeasty smell if you touch it and then put it to your nose
darv50mh6vc_6-8-rgb_front in those cases you really want to take the cat to the vet and have the vet treat them for mites or treat them for the fungus
darv50mh6vc_7-8-rgb_front some cats get a lot of waxy build up just because they are kind of a waxy cat
darv50mh6vc_8-8-rgb_front or perhaps they have food allergies or some other allergy
darv50mh6vc_9-8-rgb_front so i have put a little bit of ear cleaner cat ear cleaner on this little pad and we are just going to reach around in here there is a lot of little crevices in the ear
dbsab8f8gyc_0-9-rgb_front hi i am emily larew and now i am going to teach you how to do a wing and a toe
dbsab8f8gyc_1-9-rgb_front so what is going to happen is this you are going to do a single wing
dbsab8f8gyc_10-9-rgb_front wing and a toe
dbsab8f8gyc_11-9-rgb_front good
dbsab8f8gyc_12-9-rgb_front let is try that left foot we do not want to use and forget that one
dbsab8f8gyc_13-9-rgb_front so ready
dbsab8f8gyc_14-9-rgb_front we are going to use our right foot plie your left foot and push off
dbsab8f8gyc_15-9-rgb_front wing and a toe
dbsab8f8gyc_16-9-rgb_front wing and a toe
dbsab8f8gyc_17-9-rgb_front wing and a toe
dbsab8f8gyc_18-9-rgb_front wing and a toe
dbsab8f8gyc_2-9-rgb_front so what we are going to do is we are going to start on our left foot and we are going to do you are going to be on your right foot all you are going to do is a single wing and add a toe drop in the back
dbsab8f8gyc_20-9-rgb_front so let is try it one more time your right my left
dbsab8f8gyc_21-9-rgb_front we have go lighter on the bar cause remember that is what our goal is we are working to go center floor not using the bar because you can not take this with you when you are doing a dance in front of everybody
dbsab8f8gyc_22-9-rgb_front ready
dbsab8f8gyc_23-9-rgb_front so we have good and that is how you do a wing and a toe
dbsab8f8gyc_3-9-rgb_front so keep your toes forward weight in the balls of your feet use your plie
dbsab8f8gyc_4-9-rgb_front your going to push off your foot
dbsab8f8gyc_5-9-rgb_front toe
dbsab8f8gyc_6-9-rgb_front you drop your toe in back right afterwards before you start your next wing
dbsab8f8gyc_7-9-rgb_front wing and a toe
dbsab8f8gyc_8-9-rgb_front wing and a toe
dbsab8f8gyc_9-9-rgb_front wing and a toe
db_8cpip0t4_0-1-rgb_front hi this is sean hobson
db_8cpip0t4_1-1-rgb_front what we are talking about right now is using our forwards our power forwards as passers in the offense
db_8cpip0t4_10-1-rgb_front so you can see that he was able to give a cutter the pass because of the fact that he caught he turned to the offense and he was ready to become a passer
db_8cpip0t4_11-1-rgb_front it is going to make your offense flow a lot better
db_8cpip0t4_2-1-rgb_front and one thing you can have very valuable with our post players whether it be power forward or a center is if they are good passers your offense is really going to move well
db_8cpip0t4_3-1-rgb_front and what i am talking about there is when i feed if he is post up on the block when i feed him if he just stands with his back to the offense he does not know anything that is going on behind him
db_8cpip0t4_4-1-rgb_front so what we like to do is we either like our post players to catch and turn to one side if he can or if he can completely turn and face up if the defender drops off of him and he can turn and face up that way he can see what is happening in here and he can see to pass the ball
db_8cpip0t4_5-1-rgb_front so we are going to show you here real quickly what it looks like when i feed the post and we have got a man that is cutting down from the wing
db_8cpip0t4_6-1-rgb_front when he turns and he can see that man then he can become a good passer and he can hit the cutters and it is going to open up our offense a lot
db_8cpip0t4_7-1-rgb_front all right here we go
db_8cpip0t4_8-1-rgb_front ball
db_8cpip0t4_9-1-rgb_front good
dcn7w0lxtpe_0-8-rgb_front i would like to talk another aspect of a healthy diet
dcn7w0lxtpe_1-8-rgb_front something that is not usually discussed in relation to the five food groups and so on
dcn7w0lxtpe_10-8-rgb_front and there are different opinions about what proportion that you constitute in the diet
dcn7w0lxtpe_11-8-rgb_front there are some people that are advocating these days a completely raw food diet
dcn7w0lxtpe_12-8-rgb_front which i do not subscribe to
dcn7w0lxtpe_13-8-rgb_front i think we need more of the balance
dcn7w0lxtpe_14-8-rgb_front but this is something that is increasing in popularity as seen by the emergence of the raw food restaurants and the raw food cookbooks
dcn7w0lxtpe_15-8-rgb_front so raw foods of course we commonly think of are vegetables and fruits
dcn7w0lxtpe_16-8-rgb_front but there are other raw foods as well
dcn7w0lxtpe_17-8-rgb_front raw eggs for example
dcn7w0lxtpe_18-8-rgb_front if you remember the rocky movies
dcn7w0lxtpe_19-8-rgb_front remember rocky downing his raw eggs in his blender shake in the morning
dcn7w0lxtpe_2-8-rgb_front and that is raw food
dcn7w0lxtpe_20-8-rgb_front even raw dairy products like raw milk
dcn7w0lxtpe_21-8-rgb_front and in some states this is available
dcn7w0lxtpe_22-8-rgb_front not all
dcn7w0lxtpe_23-8-rgb_front raw milk comes from a certified dairy
dcn7w0lxtpe_24-8-rgb_front and what that means is the herd is checked on a regular basis in some cases daily to keep them clean and to prevent pathogens
dcn7w0lxtpe_25-8-rgb_front so a certified dairy turns out a very safe raw food product in my opinion
dcn7w0lxtpe_26-8-rgb_front and raw foods could also be sprouted nuts seeds grains even fish
dcn7w0lxtpe_27-8-rgb_front you have heard of sushi
dcn7w0lxtpe_28-8-rgb_front sushi consists of a lot of different types of raw fish
dcn7w0lxtpe_29-8-rgb_front and we can talk about the proportion
dcn7w0lxtpe_3-8-rgb_front the benefits of raw food and the benefits of cooked food
dcn7w0lxtpe_30-8-rgb_front as i say i do not subscribe to a completely raw diet but i believe as much as seventy percent of the diet can be raw
dcn7w0lxtpe_31-8-rgb_front and the problem with raw foods you might need to be careful about
dcn7w0lxtpe_32-8-rgb_front sometimes raw foods harbor pathogens like raw fish bacteria that might be on certain raw foods
dcn7w0lxtpe_33-8-rgb_front too much raw food in the diet can actually weaken digestion
dcn7w0lxtpe_34-8-rgb_front and certain conditions you would not want to eat a lot of raw foods
dcn7w0lxtpe_35-8-rgb_front like if a person were suffering from candida for example which is too much dampness in the body
dcn7w0lxtpe_36-8-rgb_front we do not want to contribute more dampness by eating a lot of raw foods
dcn7w0lxtpe_37-8-rgb_front some of the advantages of cooked foods
dcn7w0lxtpe_38-8-rgb_front cooked foods
dcn7w0lxtpe_39-8-rgb_front actually cooking makes some of the nutrients more available to the body
dcn7w0lxtpe_4-8-rgb_front like other aspects of nutrition we are looking for balance here
dcn7w0lxtpe_40-8-rgb_front as in the case of carrots
dcn7w0lxtpe_41-8-rgb_front you can get assimilate more carotenoids by cooking the vegetables
dcn7w0lxtpe_42-8-rgb_front not over cooking them
dcn7w0lxtpe_43-8-rgb_front but as they say
dcn7w0lxtpe_44-8-rgb_front tomatoes
dcn7w0lxtpe_45-8-rgb_front tomatoes contain lycopene another member of the carotenoid family
dcn7w0lxtpe_46-8-rgb_front and we know that men who get more cooked tomato products in the diet have a lower risk of prostate cancer
dcn7w0lxtpe_47-8-rgb_front that was not seen in those consuming the raw tomato products
dcn7w0lxtpe_48-8-rgb_front so again we need a nice balance of raw and cooked foods in the diet
dcn7w0lxtpe_49-8-rgb_front well here is a gourmet approach to raw foods
dcn7w0lxtpe_5-8-rgb_front and it is important to get raw food in the diet for the live i should say the active enzymes in there
dcn7w0lxtpe_50-8-rgb_front this is something like you might find in some of the raw food restaurants
dcn7w0lxtpe_51-8-rgb_front this is a spinach quiche
dcn7w0lxtpe_52-8-rgb_front it is got an almond crust
dcn7w0lxtpe_53-8-rgb_front and it has spinach kale celery collard greens
dcn7w0lxtpe_54-8-rgb_front and it is got sort of a mild almond creme topping
dcn7w0lxtpe_55-8-rgb_front looks delicious
dcn7w0lxtpe_56-8-rgb_front here is another one
dcn7w0lxtpe_57-8-rgb_front this is a mediterranean wrap
dcn7w0lxtpe_58-8-rgb_front this has sprouted lentils and lettuce in here
dcn7w0lxtpe_59-8-rgb_front also delicious
dcn7w0lxtpe_6-8-rgb_front enzymes are considered the life force of foods
dcn7w0lxtpe_60-8-rgb_front so these type of gourmet raw foods you would have to look around
dcn7w0lxtpe_61-8-rgb_front try your local natural foods store
dcn7w0lxtpe_62-8-rgb_front you will see more and more they are carrying some of these gourmet raw varieties
dcn7w0lxtpe_7-8-rgb_front so if you put a raw food like a raw potato in the ground it will grow into a plant
dcn7w0lxtpe_8-8-rgb_front if you put a cooked potato in the ground it will just decay
dcn7w0lxtpe_9-8-rgb_front so that is an example of the life force in raw foods
dewjbotk9um_0-8-rgb_front hello my names mark blocker
dewjbotk9um_1-8-rgb_front in this training series we are going to cover automotive tire chains
dewjbotk9um_2-8-rgb_front i am referring to tire chains used for traction devices for driving in deep snow ice or just general poor weather conditions or when you are required by law
dewjbotk9um_3-8-rgb_front basically there is two different types of chains that are out and available
dewjbotk9um_4-8-rgb_front they kind of fall there is a lot of different variations but they kind of fall in two brackets of cable chains and standard chain chains
dewjbotk9um_5-8-rgb_front which is like a standard tow chain style link and a cable chain being of like aircraft grade cable rather than chain components
dewjbotk9um_6-8-rgb_front we will go over those two different types and how to install the chains and some basic driving tips for operating the chains or operating the vehicle safely when the chains are on it
dewjbotk9um_7-8-rgb_front we will both go over the and the actual putting the chains on if you were in an inclement weather situation
dewjbotk9um_8-8-rgb_front okay so please watch our first segment we will cover the different types of automotive chains and go through their uses and applications
dfpbyrhb83s_1-1-rgb_front now we are going to talk about character development
dfpbyrhb83s_10-1-rgb_front some of the details of the character is life some of the things that are not necessarily so apparent like their age or how tall they are their body type things like that
dfpbyrhb83s_11-1-rgb_front these are more things that you would have to get to know someone with
dfpbyrhb83s_12-1-rgb_front so these are some of the ways that you can develop a character
dfpbyrhb83s_13-1-rgb_front you can say maybe they are untidy their hair is always messy and their shirt is always sticking out of their clothes their shoes are always almost falling apart they are maybe years old
dfpbyrhb83s_14-1-rgb_front so then we get to see that they had a decent amount of life experience
dfpbyrhb83s_15-1-rgb_front the relationships they tend to hang out at a bar a lot they know a lot of people that work at the bar so that is where a lot of their relationships come in
dfpbyrhb83s_16-1-rgb_front their purpose their purpose
dfpbyrhb83s_17-1-rgb_front maybe they are the confidant of the main character
dfpbyrhb83s_18-1-rgb_front maybe the main character tells them their dreams explore some of the aspects of what is going on with them maybe their biography
dfpbyrhb83s_19-1-rgb_front maybe they had the same dream as the main character but they did not achieve it
dfpbyrhb83s_2-1-rgb_front how do you develop a character
dfpbyrhb83s_20-1-rgb_front they have advice to impart for the main character on how to achieve that dream
dfpbyrhb83s_21-1-rgb_front these are ways that we can develop a character
dfpbyrhb83s_22-1-rgb_front find ways to create that life on stage
dfpbyrhb83s_3-1-rgb_front although there are things that go into a character there is the appearance of a character
dfpbyrhb83s_4-1-rgb_front there is the age of a character that functions into character development there are the relationships of a character and there is the character is purpose
dfpbyrhb83s_5-1-rgb_front why is the character on stage
dfpbyrhb83s_6-1-rgb_front this works for some of the supporting parts
dfpbyrhb83s_7-1-rgb_front what is the purpose of the character
dfpbyrhb83s_8-1-rgb_front what do they function to do
dfpbyrhb83s_9-1-rgb_front and there is also a biography
dh6-yhj30py_0-8-rgb_front clancy rose the next thing i am going to talk about is mixing the milk for the breve and then steaming the milk
dh6-yhj30py_1-8-rgb_front so today i am going to be making breve because i do not actually have a pitcher of half amp half and that is all the breve is
dh6-yhj30py_10-8-rgb_front you are going to hear air starting to be introduced into the milk and what you are doing in that process is creating the foam for the drink
dh6-yhj30py_11-8-rgb_front you are going to do that for a little bit longer than you would if you are using normal milk
dh6-yhj30py_12-8-rgb_front so in this drink we are going to do it about seven or eight seconds and then after you stretch the milk then you raise the pitcher back up so that the steam wand is submerged down into the milk and get the position right again so that it swirls and keep it swirling until it is at the temperature that you want to drink
dh6-yhj30py_2-8-rgb_front so if you have half amp half then you just use that
dh6-yhj30py_3-8-rgb_front to make breve i am going to use half whole milk and half heavy whipping cream and i am going to pour it into my pitcher and i am going to be doing this in a cup so that means i am going to fill out the milk into the pitcher right up to this ridge and that is about how milk you should use in your pitcher
dh6-yhj30py_4-8-rgb_front and i am going to move on to steaming the milk
dh6-yhj30py_5-8-rgb_front so i am going to do this in three motions
dh6-yhj30py_6-8-rgb_front first position the pitcher around the steam wand in such a way that when you turn on the steam wand the milk starts to swirl inside the pitcher around the edges of the pitcher
dh6-yhj30py_7-8-rgb_front you do that until you can feel the milk temperature kind of match your hand and it is right about degrees
dh6-yhj30py_8-8-rgb_front you feel that warm break in the milk
dh6-yhj30py_9-8-rgb_front all right when that happens you are going to lower the pitcher down to where the tip of the steam wand is right above the surface of the milk
dhkaq8yh0km_0-5-rgb_front so i am going to show you two variations of the letter a we will start with one that is a little bit simpler
dhkaq8yh0km_1-5-rgb_front so again i need to get some ink in my pen and the round form of the letter a begins with a curved stroke just like the first stroke of the o and then i am going to bring this stroke around and down so there is a round a
dhkaq8yh0km_2-5-rgb_front but it is not the most exciting letter so i will show you a different a
dhkaq8yh0km_3-5-rgb_front and that is going to start with a diagonal stroke and then what is called a leaf stroke
dhkaq8yh0km_4-5-rgb_front so i am putting
dhkaq8yh0km_5-5-rgb_front so that is going to break down into three strokes
dhkaq8yh0km_6-5-rgb_front one two three
dhkaq8yh0km_7-5-rgb_front so you have a choice and you will find this with many alphabets of which style of letter you like
dhkaq8yh0km_8-5-rgb_front so you can try either a and try both a is
dkjro_i7d3q_0-8-rgb_front hi i am allison from imagiknit in san francisco and i am going to show you how to repair a dropped stitch in knitting
dkjro_i7d3q_1-8-rgb_front a dropped stitch occurs when it slips off of the needle and then comes out through the stitch underneath it
dkjro_i7d3q_10-8-rgb_front we want to make sure we place that back on the needle correctly
dkjro_i7d3q_11-8-rgb_front in order to do that the right side of the loop versus the left side which is here on the back you definitely want the right side of the loop on the front of the needle because if it is placed this way it will twist your stitch so place it this way so the right side of the loop versus the left side is on the front of the needle facing you
dkjro_i7d3q_12-8-rgb_front here we have repaired our dropped stitch good as new
dkjro_i7d3q_2-8-rgb_front a drop stitch like this is a very common error
dkjro_i7d3q_3-8-rgb_front the easiest way to fix it is to have a crochet hook handy and go ahead that through the dropped stitch
dkjro_i7d3q_4-8-rgb_front then go ahead and reach for the first rung on the ladder with your crochet hook grab that and pull that through the dropped stitch
dkjro_i7d3q_5-8-rgb_front then repeat as you go up each rung on the ladder
dkjro_i7d3q_6-8-rgb_front pull it through
dkjro_i7d3q_7-8-rgb_front we have know completed two rows worth and we have got one more to go
dkjro_i7d3q_8-8-rgb_front we will pull that through our loop
dkjro_i7d3q_9-8-rgb_front and now we have got our dropped stitch here
dlxnxaywr9w_0_1-1-rgb_front the question has been asked how to break in a new baseball glove well there is a lot of things that you can do to break in a baseball glove but some of the things i would suggest is we want to first soften the leather and make the glove so you can do this make the glove bend in this matter so it is easier to hold on to the ball
dlxnxaywr9w_2-1-rgb_front some of the things you can do is to add tanners oil which softens the leather
dlxnxaywr9w_3-1-rgb_front neatsfoot oil although be careful with neatsfoot oil because sometimes tends to make the glove heavy or there is many other products you can buy at your local sporting good store that suppose to be helpful to breaking in a glove
dlxnxaywr9w_4-1-rgb_front the other thing you can do is literally go at it and do a lot of catching in it because that is one of the fastest ways to break in a new baseball glove
dlxnxaywr9w_5-1-rgb_front you can also get a glove and pound in a ball excuse me and pound into the glove and that helps with that and then constantly bend the glove in a matter so that you can get so that it has more flexibility and be able to bend in that matter
dlxnxaywr9w_6-1-rgb_front now be careful when you are squeezing the glove like this that you do not develop a wrinkle in the pocket
dlxnxaywr9w_7-1-rgb_front if you get a wrinkle in the pocket the glove is going to wear out faster and it is not going to have the pocket like you want it to be
dlxnxaywr9w_8-1-rgb_front so i would suggest to help with that situation is to put a ball in your glove when you are done with it each day and then put a rubber band or something elastic around it to hold it in place and keep this pocket nice and big
dlxnxaywr9w_9-1-rgb_front so that you can have the flexibility that you need and not get any wrinkles in the palm of the glove which is very important but you can do lots of different things to break into a baseball glove but there is not substitute for just playing going out into the yard into the field and playing a little catch because do it faster than anything and basically that is how you break in a new baseball glove
dm6vdcpd6j4_1-5-rgb_front before starting to mud i went ahead and laid down a painter tarp and some spared towels just in case i spill some of the mud or falls off the wall it is not going to get in the carpet
dm6vdcpd6j4_2-5-rgb_front for filling holes are closet is going to be the worst area just because we pulled out that shelving unit and there was a lot of different bracket that held that in
dm6vdcpd6j4_3-5-rgb_front on another portion of our wall we had another shelf which was held in by a big screw so we are going to have to fill this as well
dm6vdcpd6j4_4-5-rgb_front the first thing i am going to do with these holes is take a utility knife and cut a divit around them because when we pulled those nails out it did raised up the drywall a little bit we just going to break that back down
dm6vdcpd6j4_5-5-rgb_front next i am going to take a little bit of sandpaper and make sure that is smooth
dm6vdcpd6j4_6-5-rgb_front next we are going to take a little bit of mud and fill in that hole now you want to leave a little bit of mud about the surface so that we can sand it down later
dm6vdcpd6j4_7-5-rgb_front when you mud your holes you might need to do this over about or days span just cause when the mud dries it will get smaller and it will show that hole a little bit
dmuuravhek8_0-8-rgb_front another important thing to do for your dog is always have one spot in the house that is devoted for the dog for sleeping resting relaxing whatever
dmuuravhek8_1-8-rgb_front in this case we have an extra bedroom and i let possum sleep on the bed in here
dmuuravhek8_10-8-rgb_front she stays really close all the time and has ever since she was a puppy
dmuuravhek8_11-8-rgb_front not everybody can devote that kind of time but you can devote enough love to give your dog its own little bed so it can always have somewhere to rest and sleep and they love you back for that
dmuuravhek8_12-8-rgb_front do not you ms possum
dmuuravhek8_13-8-rgb_front see she is asleep
dmuuravhek8_14-8-rgb_front she is sleeping like a baby
dmuuravhek8_2-8-rgb_front she does not get on the other bed unless i call her up there
dmuuravhek8_3-8-rgb_front a lot of people do not like dog hair on the bed or whatever
dmuuravhek8_4-8-rgb_front it does not bother me
dmuuravhek8_5-8-rgb_front i just tend to wash my sheets more
dmuuravhek8_6-8-rgb_front in this case i let possum have her very own bed
dmuuravhek8_7-8-rgb_front she knows that she does not have to get on any other piece of furniture that she always has this to come home to
dmuuravhek8_8-8-rgb_front now if we have guests over then what i do is i make a little pillow in the corner and she can sleep on that and she knows that that is her bed because it has her blanket that she has
dmuuravhek8_9-8-rgb_front i always bring her in here to my office so i can work and have her near me and she is like my shadow
dnhhd661caq_0-8-rgb_front one of our last finishing touches for our underwater mural are bubbles and for bubbles we are going to use more of our foam brushes
dnhhd661caq_1-8-rgb_front now unlike some of our last square foam brushes these are circular and these are excellent for first off you can stamp it eyes
dnhhd661caq_10-8-rgb_front you can have more of these going up
dnhhd661caq_11-8-rgb_front i find it is really useful when you are basically putting down your bubble go down and then rotate about degrees
dnhhd661caq_12-8-rgb_front about a half circle and then to pull away
dnhhd661caq_13-8-rgb_front you can see these are already looking a lot more like bubbles
dnhhd661caq_14-8-rgb_front now we do not want just bubbles of the same shape which is why i recommend also using the smaller circular foam brush
dnhhd661caq_15-8-rgb_front again the exact same strategy as with the other one
dnhhd661caq_16-8-rgb_front we are going to put some paint on here not to thick and then we are going to put it on here do a little half circle pull away
dnhhd661caq_17-8-rgb_front same thing over here and so on
dnhhd661caq_18-8-rgb_front now you can see you are starting to get like a nice little bubbling effect here coming up from our sand castle and around our crab area
dnhhd661caq_19-8-rgb_front that is what we want to continue to do
dnhhd661caq_2-8-rgb_front you can also be used to make bubbles and other circular shapes
dnhhd661caq_20-8-rgb_front once you learn how to do this it starts to get very easy very quick to do
dnhhd661caq_21-8-rgb_front the one thing i will advise you against though is do not make to many bubbles in the same area because after a while it will start to look crowded and cluttered and this is underwater
dnhhd661caq_22-8-rgb_front you have some occasional bubbles going upwards but that is about it
dnhhd661caq_23-8-rgb_front now that we have finished putting bubbles on our mural let is take a second to look at the different areas of the mural and the final product that we have worked towards today
dnhhd661caq_24-8-rgb_front you can see how the colors have all come together and helped make you make a very special mural yourself
dnhhd661caq_3-8-rgb_front so you are going to take both of these we are going to have our lighter paint color and we are going to lightly dip these in here
dnhhd661caq_4-8-rgb_front now the trick is to not make the bubbles appear super solid
dnhhd661caq_5-8-rgb_front bubbles are translucent
dnhhd661caq_6-8-rgb_front they are not always exactly the same
dnhhd661caq_7-8-rgb_front basically what you are going to do is take your foam brush put paint on the top and put it on here
dnhhd661caq_8-8-rgb_front you can rotate there ground a little bit
dnhhd661caq_9-8-rgb_front so there you go you just get sort of a bubble
dnzyz8szhsg_0-1-rgb_front okay so what we are doing is we are checking our oil in our vehicle and this is really important
dnzyz8szhsg_1-1-rgb_front oil has been explained to me a few times the lifeblood of your car and you obviously do not want that to go bad
dnzyz8szhsg_10-1-rgb_front if it is below the add line then obviously you want to go ahead and add some oil
dnzyz8szhsg_11-1-rgb_front but for our purposes we are going to go ahead and change the oil
dnzyz8szhsg_12-1-rgb_front so that is just a good way to you want to monitor this every once in a while just to make sure that you have got enough oil in there because if you have too little oil that could really damage your car
dnzyz8szhsg_13-1-rgb_front so that is checking your oil and next we are going to go into actually changing the oil
dnzyz8szhsg_2-1-rgb_front how often do you want to change your oil is a good question
dnzyz8szhsg_3-1-rgb_front generally most people say by miles or months your oil sitting in your car so that is a pretty good estimate i mean it kind of depends on your car it depends on the oil
dnzyz8szhsg_4-1-rgb_front but you definitely want to get your oil changed you want to make sure you are changing it because it is really really important
dnzyz8szhsg_5-1-rgb_front so what we are going to do right now is check our oil which is pretty straight forward
dnzyz8szhsg_6-1-rgb_front generally most cars you will find a dipstick with for example this one has a little oil graphic on it
dnzyz8szhsg_7-1-rgb_front so what you are going to want to do is you just pull this out go ahead and wipe off the oil that is on there right now because the oil might have jumped up and down or it might have rubbed up against something just to get a clean read
dnzyz8szhsg_8-1-rgb_front so wipe it off first you put it back in make sure it goes all the way back in and then pull it right back out and there should be a level on there
dnzyz8szhsg_9-1-rgb_front for example this one looks a little low there is a little place marker on this one that says add and safe so safe is going to be obviously you are going to be good on your oil
domosv-zfci_0-2-rgb_front hi
domosv-zfci_10-2-rgb_front and brad knows this because he is done a lot of self hypnosis to help him improve his golf game
domosv-zfci_11-2-rgb_front even though he is a top instructor already
domosv-zfci_12-2-rgb_front but even they can improve
domosv-zfci_13-2-rgb_front and with deep breathing you will learn how important it is to begin this relaxation step
domosv-zfci_14-2-rgb_front so in order to deep breathe we always begin at the very bottom of our stomach
domosv-zfci_15-2-rgb_front so brad if you could put your hands on the bottom of your stomach so that we can see your hands expanding
domosv-zfci_16-2-rgb_front and you always want to start at the very bottom of your stomach
domosv-zfci_17-2-rgb_front in fact everyone push your stomach out
domosv-zfci_18-2-rgb_front we want you to imagine that your stomach is like a balloon and we have to push the balloon out so that we can breathe in
domosv-zfci_19-2-rgb_front and he is going to breathe all the way up
domosv-zfci_2-2-rgb_front and today i have with me brad brewer
domosv-zfci_20-2-rgb_front and he is going to breathe
domosv-zfci_21-2-rgb_front in fact he could you can keep your eyes open or closed whatever you prefer brad
domosv-zfci_22-2-rgb_front but he is going to breathe all the way up in fact as if the breath is touching the top of his head
domosv-zfci_23-2-rgb_front now we know that your lungs stop here but he is going to breathe as if it is coming to this place
domosv-zfci_24-2-rgb_front so breath all the way up
domosv-zfci_25-2-rgb_front breathe breathe breathe breathe in through your nose and you always exhale through your nose
domosv-zfci_26-2-rgb_front exhale through your nose
domosv-zfci_27-2-rgb_front and you can see how his shoulders and his chest and his stomach deflate
domosv-zfci_28-2-rgb_front and then he pushes his stomach out
domosv-zfci_29-2-rgb_front he breathes in as deep as he can all the way up with his nose
domosv-zfci_3-2-rgb_front owner of the brad brewer golf academy at the beautiful rose shingle creek in orlando florida
domosv-zfci_30-2-rgb_front that is great
domosv-zfci_31-2-rgb_front and then he breathes out
domosv-zfci_32-2-rgb_front all the way down
domosv-zfci_33-2-rgb_front see how his shoulders come down his chest comes down and his stomach comes down
domosv-zfci_34-2-rgb_front that is the proper way to breathe
domosv-zfci_35-2-rgb_front always breathe from the very bottom of your stomach
domosv-zfci_36-2-rgb_front pull the breath up to the highest part that you can get it and then relax it down as if a balloon is deflating
domosv-zfci_37-2-rgb_front breathe in through the nose and out through the nose
domosv-zfci_38-2-rgb_front and that is the proper way to breathe deeply
domosv-zfci_4-2-rgb_front we are talking about self hypnosis
domosv-zfci_5-2-rgb_front and in this segment we are going to talk about why it is import to properly breathe deeply
domosv-zfci_6-2-rgb_front and brad is going to show us how to breathe deeply
domosv-zfci_7-2-rgb_front right
domosv-zfci_8-2-rgb_front thank you
domosv-zfci_9-2-rgb_front so the most important thing
dpmvq0alr_4_0-8-rgb_front nathan mccullough hi
dpmvq0alr_4_10-8-rgb_front so if you opt for the snow tire option what you are going to want to do is run your snow tires for only the months between say november and early march
dpmvq0alr_4_11-8-rgb_front if you are to run your snow tires in the summertime they will wear out extremely fast
dpmvq0alr_4_12-8-rgb_front so if you want to get snow tires hang on to your old tires
dpmvq0alr_4_13-8-rgb_front unless your tire professional advises you that they are already gone or worn out or destroyed keep them just have them up in the back of your truck or car
dpmvq0alr_4_14-8-rgb_front take them home
dpmvq0alr_4_15-8-rgb_front put them in your garage or over by the side of your house and save them for later installation when the summertime comes
dpmvq0alr_4_16-8-rgb_front and that is the proper way to ensure that you have a good thread surface for the winter time while driving your vehicle
dpmvq0alr_4_2-8-rgb_front in these clips we are going to talk about some of the tips and tricks in order to properly winterize your vehicle
dpmvq0alr_4_3-8-rgb_front there is also another option which you are going to really want to consider if you live in a snowy area they are snow tires
dpmvq0alr_4_4-8-rgb_front there are several different brands mix and models of snow tires and they are priced very significantly
dpmvq0alr_4_5-8-rgb_front generally a snow tire will be a little thinner and the tread will be slightly knobbier
dpmvq0alr_4_6-8-rgb_front what that we will do is provide more space for that snow to squish into as your tread knobs grip the ground
dpmvq0alr_4_7-8-rgb_front snow tires are great
dpmvq0alr_4_8-8-rgb_front they work wonderfully in the winter time
dpmvq0alr_4_9-8-rgb_front however in the summertime they wear extremely fast
dq9lgnzm2mo_0-8-rgb_front clancy rose so the next thing that we are going to talk about is your espresso grinder
dq9lgnzm2mo_1-8-rgb_front so this is one example of an espresso grinder
dq9lgnzm2mo_10-8-rgb_front that is the only way to adjust the grind setting on a a small home grinder
dq9lgnzm2mo_11-8-rgb_front on this grinder as marked right here on the grinder counterclockwise
dq9lgnzm2mo_12-8-rgb_front if you move this counterclockwise it is going to grind the coffee finer and if you move it clockwise it is going to grind the coffee a lot coarser
dq9lgnzm2mo_13-8-rgb_front this is one of the biggest ways that you control the shot of espresso
dq9lgnzm2mo_14-8-rgb_front the finer the coffee is the more resistance it has against the water that is passing through the coffee pot and the slower the shot of espresso is going to pull the longer it is going to take
dq9lgnzm2mo_15-8-rgb_front and the coarser that you have the coffee the quicker the shot is going to pull because the water does not have as much resistance going through the pot
dq9lgnzm2mo_2-8-rgb_front for this machine you have your hopper right here where you are going to put the coffee into
dq9lgnzm2mo_3-8-rgb_front the coffee flows into the actual grinder where it is going to grind the coffee and it is going to shoot it out into the dosing chamber here
dq9lgnzm2mo_4-8-rgb_front the dosing chamber is controlled by a lever on the side where you are going to be able to pull it and move the coffee out of the dosing chamber
dq9lgnzm2mo_5-8-rgb_front also on the side here is the switch to turn the grinder on and off
dq9lgnzm2mo_6-8-rgb_front and this is the rest where you are going to put the porta filter to dose the coffee into the porta filter
dq9lgnzm2mo_7-8-rgb_front so if you have one of the smaller home grinders and not a big machine like this you just basically going to put the coffee into the top part of it with the top plastic part and close it up and hit the button to start grinding the coffee and you are going to grind it finer than you would for a normal cup of coffee
dq9lgnzm2mo_8-8-rgb_front an espresso grind is considerably finer
dq9lgnzm2mo_9-8-rgb_front one guideline that i have heard is going is somewhere above seconds so you are going to grind for a little bit more than seconds
dqmevm8sr4y_1-5-rgb_front i am going to show you how to remove and replace the accessories grinding wheels and cut off wheels
dqmevm8sr4y_2-5-rgb_front you want to push this button in and then it locks it locks the gear in place
dqmevm8sr4y_3-5-rgb_front you want to make sure you have your tool you tool to take off the wheels
dqmevm8sr4y_4-5-rgb_front on these there is a lip on here that you use it is a raised and you put it down and that is what you would use for the grinding wheels
dqmevm8sr4y_5-5-rgb_front there is a flat surface on the other side you want to use that for the cut off wheels
dqmevm8sr4y_6-5-rgb_front you want to make sure you are holding the button in still on the other side
dqmevm8sr4y_7-5-rgb_front you want to tighten as much as you can with your tool make sure that it is tight and it is on there good and you can start cutting
drnqmr0inrk_0-5-rgb_front now that you have got the string on your guitar and you got some tension on it you want to make sure that the string is in its right tuning
drnqmr0inrk_1-5-rgb_front you do not want to crank down the tuning peg too far or you will break the string so when you initially get the string on there make sure it is a little bit taut and then we will tune it up
drnqmr0inrk_2-5-rgb_front now one way you can tune your instrument is by comparing the strings to one another on the neck
drnqmr0inrk_3-5-rgb_front now if you play the fifth fret which is right here on one string it is going to be the same note as the next open string down
drnqmr0inrk_4-5-rgb_front now that is assuming that the first string that you have got you know is in tune or you are just concerned about having the guitar be in tune with itself so that the chords will sound good
drnqmr0inrk_5-5-rgb_front now you would play the fifth fret on this string and then the next open string and they should sound the same
drnqmr0inrk_6-5-rgb_front now if they are not it is way out just tune it up until they sound the same
drnqmr0inrk_7-5-rgb_front now an important note here is that the everything is going to be fifth fret to next open string except the g string
drnqmr0inrk_8-5-rgb_front the g string will be the fourth fret to the next open string and then you are back to the fifth fret when you get to the b string to the high e string
dtfzrmk3tro_0-8-rgb_front all of these old balloon tire bikes had chain guards
dtfzrmk3tro_1-8-rgb_front you rarely find a chain guard on a bike today but they served a great purpose
dtfzrmk3tro_10-8-rgb_front the skipped tooth chains were heavier and they are hard to find today but if you find a bike that has a skipped tooth chain you have got a good old bike
dtfzrmk3tro_2-8-rgb_front a chain guard keeps your pants from getting grease from the chain
dtfzrmk3tro_3-8-rgb_front people actually rode in street clothes on these bicycles they used it for transportation something that people rarely do today
dtfzrmk3tro_4-8-rgb_front but this chain guard is ready to remove so i can show you what is underneath
dtfzrmk3tro_5-8-rgb_front here is the front chain ring
dtfzrmk3tro_6-8-rgb_front the first unique thing you see about this chain ring is the spacing between the teeth this is called a skipped tooth or inch pitch chain setup
dtfzrmk3tro_7-8-rgb_front and it works the way a normal cycle chain does today but there are gaps in the chain and gaps in these teeth
dtfzrmk3tro_8-8-rgb_front and again you just peddle forward like a normal bike and go backwards to apply the breaks
dtfzrmk3tro_9-8-rgb_front you can follow the chain back here and you will see the sprocket if you can see in there that sprocket of course has the skipped tooth setup
dtgtguzraau_0-5-rgb_front we have some hot olive oil ready to go ready to put the chicken in our pan
dtgtguzraau_1-5-rgb_front i am just going to put them on
dtgtguzraau_2-5-rgb_front now with this size pan i have chosen to just do how many breasts here
dtgtguzraau_3-5-rgb_front we have got five chicken breasts and on this particular pan there is not going to be much more room in here
dtgtguzraau_4-5-rgb_front i also have a skillet i sometimes use if i am going to cook about ten breasts of chicken at once if you have got a big party the big skillet i will actually bring that out in a little bit when we heat up our tortillas but right now this serves us and suits us for about five breasts
dtgtguzraau_5-5-rgb_front now these breasts of chicken will actually feed up to like nine or ten people because there is so many other ingredients going into your fajitas you do not need one breast per person
dtgtguzraau_6-5-rgb_front because there is a lot of the green peppers and the onions and all the chicken
dtgtguzraau_7-5-rgb_front so in just a minute we will come back after our chicken is cooked a little bit
dtgtguzraau_8-5-rgb_front we are going to add some of our onions and green peppers here in just a minute
dudhzhkbkce_0-5-rgb_front now to finish the look i am going to talk about mascara brushes
dudhzhkbkce_1-5-rgb_front i have a mascara wand and also a mascara comb
dudhzhkbkce_2-5-rgb_front this is also an eyebrow brush
dudhzhkbkce_3-5-rgb_front so if you do not have the the other kind that looks like this one you can use this one in place of it
dudhzhkbkce_4-5-rgb_front what you always want to look for i like the curved mascara brushes because they go with the shape of the eye and then it is very easy to apply on both sides
dudhzhkbkce_5-5-rgb_front so what you want to do when you are applying the mascara you want to start by coming in and circling the brush up
dudhzhkbkce_6-5-rgb_front and you also want to wiggle it a little bit at the base to keep it from clumping
dudhzhkbkce_7-5-rgb_front but if you do end up getting clumps then you can go over it with the comb and it will help separate the lashes again
dudhzhkbkce_8-5-rgb_front again contour brush or a curved brush is best to use for eyes on both sides
dudhzhkbkce_9-5-rgb_front and then you are not battling trying to go like this to get your mascara on all your lashes
dvbdwglzayi_1-8-rgb_front and in this step i am going to show you how to apply your pieces to your art glass
dvbdwglzayi_10-8-rgb_front okay
dvbdwglzayi_11-8-rgb_front o is for orange as far as the way i labeled it for myself
dvbdwglzayi_12-8-rgb_front remember to put the grain line it needs to match the grain line on your glass
dvbdwglzayi_13-8-rgb_front there is another orange
dvbdwglzayi_14-8-rgb_front leave room to cut them out
dvbdwglzayi_15-8-rgb_front there is a red
dvbdwglzayi_16-8-rgb_front from each other leave some space and there is a red okay
dvbdwglzayi_17-8-rgb_front if you have never cut art glass before do yourself a favor and try practicing on some window glass
dvbdwglzayi_18-8-rgb_front we have got a couple of pieces here okay
dvbdwglzayi_19-8-rgb_front window glass is just your clear glass
dvbdwglzayi_2-8-rgb_front remember we labeled you want to keep those somewhat separate okay
dvbdwglzayi_21-8-rgb_front really good stuff to practice on it is much cheaper than your art glass okay
dvbdwglzayi_22-8-rgb_front you are going to put that on there and you are going to practice cutting on this before you go to your glass okay
dvbdwglzayi_23-8-rgb_front so practice
dvbdwglzayi_24-8-rgb_front on the step next i am going to show you how to cut glass whether it is this glass for practice or a beautiful colored art glass
dvbdwglzayi_25-8-rgb_front it is going to be our happy sun stepping stone we are going to make in this mold so check it out
dvbdwglzayi_3-8-rgb_front when you get those step over grab your glue
dvbdwglzayi_4-8-rgb_front you need some type of glue okay
dvbdwglzayi_5-8-rgb_front i have got them turned facedown here
dvbdwglzayi_6-8-rgb_front i am going to barely spray
dvbdwglzayi_7-8-rgb_front you want to spray your glue onto something
dvbdwglzayi_8-8-rgb_front i am going to pick up these pattern pieces now okay
dvbdwglzayi_9-8-rgb_front sometimes they will just stick to your fingers
dvbjlbs5rm0_0-2-rgb_front hi i am kyle brayer
dvbjlbs5rm0_1-2-rgb_front a nice cardio workout for your training session would be a side hop
dvbjlbs5rm0_10-2-rgb_front so you can squat and hop squat and hop back and forth
dvbjlbs5rm0_11-2-rgb_front from the side squat and hop squat and hop
dvbjlbs5rm0_12-2-rgb_front so again if you are doing your make sure that knee does not come over the toe and you keep all the fundamentals of the perfect squat you are keeping your chest nice and high your head forward and knees not coming over the toes and you are dropping back with your glutes
dvbjlbs5rm0_13-2-rgb_front so from the front side to side
dvbjlbs5rm0_14-2-rgb_front and that will be your squat or side hop
dvbjlbs5rm0_2-2-rgb_front side hop is a great basic movement that is going to get your legs involved and get your heart rate up
dvbjlbs5rm0_3-2-rgb_front so all you do is you stand somewhere on your floor and you are going to pick an object on the floor if you have a tile or something like a crack in the floor that you can jump across makes it a little easier
dvbjlbs5rm0_4-2-rgb_front you can also set an object down on the ground
dvbjlbs5rm0_5-2-rgb_front you are going to keep your hands up in athletic stance and you are just going to hop side to side
dvbjlbs5rm0_6-2-rgb_front so it is like this back and forth
dvbjlbs5rm0_7-2-rgb_front from the side back and forth
dvbjlbs5rm0_8-2-rgb_front very basic movement it gets your heart rate way up
dvbjlbs5rm0_9-2-rgb_front if you want to get a little more advanced you can actually add a squat into your side hop
dwxb_oaeaag_0-8-rgb_front so we have two yixing teapots here how do you brew it
dwxb_oaeaag_1-8-rgb_front yixing teapots are usually recommended for oolong teas or black black tea
dwxb_oaeaag_2-8-rgb_front usually it is the puer tea that is best
dwxb_oaeaag_3-8-rgb_front because yixing pots are not glazed on the inside and when you brew the tea every time you brew it the teapot absorbs all the flavors and aroma of that tea and with each subsequent brew and every time you use this teapot you get tea that is a little bit enhanced
dwxb_oaeaag_4-8-rgb_front and oolong tea it is also recommended with you can use this because oolong tea imparts flavors of aroma of orchids and lilac and these teapots will absorb that
dwxb_oaeaag_5-8-rgb_front so if you want to use the yixing you do not have to worry about using any filter there is already a filter that is inside these teapots and the tea is put in
dwxb_oaeaag_6-8-rgb_front you put a concentrated amount just because you are using so little water and you are infusing it only twenty seconds thirty seconds at a time so that your guest is constantly getting replenished with warm or hot tea
dwxb_oaeaag_7-8-rgb_front and you hold the yixing teapots like this and there is a little hole at the center when you put your finger in that hole it stops the water from coming out
dwxb_oaeaag_8-8-rgb_front but when you release it and hold it on the side your tea will come out
dz1k0e0eewq_0-5-rgb_front now that base is on we are going to move on to the lid color
dz1k0e0eewq_1-5-rgb_front for the lid color you have so many choices
dz1k0e0eewq_10-5-rgb_front i am going to take a smaller brush and i am going to go right into this color
dz1k0e0eewq_11-5-rgb_front you want to put a little at a time until it gets to your desired depth of color
dz1k0e0eewq_12-5-rgb_front you are going to put it directly on the lid
dz1k0e0eewq_13-5-rgb_front the lid is basically from where the eyelash is
dz1k0e0eewq_14-5-rgb_front meet the lid to up to the crease
dz1k0e0eewq_15-5-rgb_front this is basically your lid where the ball of the eye protrudes
dz1k0e0eewq_16-5-rgb_front you do not want to go any higher than this because you want to keep this highlighted under the brow but you want to get as close to the lashes as you can
dz1k0e0eewq_17-5-rgb_front you want everything to just look blended and balanced
dz1k0e0eewq_18-5-rgb_front it is all about blending blending blending
dz1k0e0eewq_19-5-rgb_front add a little more and a little more if you want it to be darker and darker
dz1k0e0eewq_2-5-rgb_front like i said i am going to go with something that goes along with the theme of clothes she is wearing
dz1k0e0eewq_20-5-rgb_front if you spill a little bit that is fine
dz1k0e0eewq_21-5-rgb_front just clean it up with a brush afterwards
dz1k0e0eewq_22-5-rgb_front it is not a big deal
dz1k0e0eewq_23-5-rgb_front open
dz1k0e0eewq_24-5-rgb_front i am going to do it a little darker since it is an evening look
dz1k0e0eewq_25-5-rgb_front you can get dramatic and just blend blend blend
dz1k0e0eewq_26-5-rgb_front there we go
dz1k0e0eewq_27-5-rgb_front it is a beautiful lid color
dz1k0e0eewq_3-5-rgb_front kind of like in the plums eggplants
dz1k0e0eewq_4-5-rgb_front i am going to use kind of a plum brown that has a shimmer to it
dz1k0e0eewq_5-5-rgb_front there is so many you could use
dz1k0e0eewq_6-5-rgb_front you could use one that is more lavender more bronze
dz1k0e0eewq_7-5-rgb_front there is just an assortment of colors you can choose
dz1k0e0eewq_8-5-rgb_front i like this one because it is got a bit of an iridescence to it
dz1k0e0eewq_9-5-rgb_front it goes on really smooth and it is just dark enough to be a lid color but not dark enough to be a crease color
dzctdqsw2dk_0-8-rgb_front we are going to apply a toner to take off any excess product and we are going to go ahead and apply the mask
dzctdqsw2dk_1-8-rgb_front we are going to start with the eye pads because we want to protect the eyes
dzctdqsw2dk_10-8-rgb_front we have several selections of different masks for different types of skins
dzctdqsw2dk_11-8-rgb_front so we will let this mask sit for five minutes and then we will move forward
dzctdqsw2dk_12-8-rgb_front okay
dzctdqsw2dk_2-8-rgb_front and we are once again going to use a hydrating mask
dzctdqsw2dk_3-8-rgb_front so we are going to go ahead and apply the mask in light strokes
dzctdqsw2dk_4-8-rgb_front it is a lovely shade of green very smooth has a lot of nice aroma to it and once again very hydrating
dzctdqsw2dk_5-8-rgb_front we are going to put this mask on and allow it to sit about five minutes
dzctdqsw2dk_6-8-rgb_front and then we will return remove the mask and add the final touches which will be a hydrating creme
dzctdqsw2dk_7-8-rgb_front and this this mask is a hydrating mask and one of the components that is very hydrating is a shay butter and that is one of the very highly hydrating masks that we have here
dzctdqsw2dk_8-8-rgb_front and for this type of skin this is what you want to use
dzctdqsw2dk_9-8-rgb_front if you are a client who had very oily skin or little bit oiler skin you would not want to use this mask
e2nhkrl-ejo_1-5-rgb_front and now we are going to talk about clockwork vorrac
e2nhkrl-ejo_2-5-rgb_front clockwork vorrac is an artifact creature beast which means it counts as an artifact and counts as a beast
e2nhkrl-ejo_3-5-rgb_front it is an uncommon and clockwork vorrac costs you colorless to play and is a creature
e2nhkrl-ejo_4-5-rgb_front now once again since it is a creature you know something is going on
e2nhkrl-ejo_5-5-rgb_front first off that this creature comes into play with four counters on it which means it comes into play as a and it also has trample
e2nhkrl-ejo_6-5-rgb_front as well as coming in as a with trample it has whenever clockwork vorrac attacks or blocks remove a counter from him
e2nhkrl-ejo_7-5-rgb_front also has the ability that you can tap clockwork vorrac and put a counter on clockwork vorrac so he can constantly pump himself up and wait to attack until later because he does have trample and can run over all of the little blockers
e3fk_uzthbm_0-8-rgb_front there are two types of swimming on the river one is defensive swimming and one is aggressive swimming
e3fk_uzthbm_1-8-rgb_front with defensive swimming what really doing is laying on your back feet downstream and looking for help sort of getting yourself oriented to the river trying to figure out where you are and then getting yourself comfortably there
e3fk_uzthbm_2-8-rgb_front defensive swimming tends to be for novice and guests that are real or not real familiar with white water
e3fk_uzthbm_3-8-rgb_front a person swimming defensively is looking to be rescued by somebody else rather than really taking the initiative and rescuing themselves
e3fk_uzthbm_4-8-rgb_front the aggressive uh swimming aggressive white water swimming is where the guide or an experienced um white water person is taking control of their situation and swimming aggressively uh from one side of the river to the other either to the quickest point on shore or to avoid uh a certain obstacle while out there
e5hyroyj9pk_0-8-rgb_front hi there i am tracy goodwin and i am the red sweater lady and today we are going to be talking about how to improve perception
e5hyroyj9pk_1-8-rgb_front well how to improve perception of what
e5hyroyj9pk_10-8-rgb_front well there is actually some things that you can do some things that you can be aware of to help you improve your perception which will then in turn improve your interpersonal relationships
e5hyroyj9pk_2-8-rgb_front well people places things ideas
e5hyroyj9pk_3-8-rgb_front what is perception
e5hyroyj9pk_4-8-rgb_front perception is how you think and feel about things people places ideas and in order to be a successful interpersonal communicator which is what we all strive for we have to learn to improve our perception
e5hyroyj9pk_5-8-rgb_front perception can get in the way of our communication
e5hyroyj9pk_6-8-rgb_front it can get in the way of our relationships
e5hyroyj9pk_7-8-rgb_front with loved ones with husbands and wives with with bosses with everybody that we come in to in to contact with
e5hyroyj9pk_8-8-rgb_front some people will tell you right away that they have really good perception
e5hyroyj9pk_9-8-rgb_front they can really they are really right about people when they first meet them and other people will say oh i have terrible perception i mean i always judge people wrong
e5sqbxopvzw_0-5-rgb_front you know quite a few of us and a growing number of people are not real comfortable using some type of chemical or commercially sold product as a bug repellent
e5sqbxopvzw_1-5-rgb_front hi i am captain joe bruni and what i am going to talk about is how to make a natural type of bug repellent
e5sqbxopvzw_2-5-rgb_front a natural bug repellent can be made by mixing a third of a cup of distilled water a third of a cup of cooking oil such as olive oil and then twenty drops of some type of oil like peppermint citronella or eucalyptus oil
e5sqbxopvzw_3-5-rgb_front place this mixture inside some type of bottle and shake
e5sqbxopvzw_4-5-rgb_front the mixture can then be applied as some type of rub on lotion or some type of spray on bug repellent
e5sqbxopvzw_5-5-rgb_front it is a natural type of bug repellent that will repel most insects and does not contain any of the dangerous chemicals that many of us would prefer not to apply to our skin or clothing
e5sqbxopvzw_6-5-rgb_front i am captain joe bruni making this natural bug repellent is one way to avoid the worries of toxic chemicals
e5sqbxopvzw_7-5-rgb_front stay safe and we will see you next time
e6kaamscxwy_0-8-rgb_front once your image is drawn on the paper it is time to decorate it
e6kaamscxwy_1-8-rgb_front now it is very important when decorating that you want to use a lot of color as i mentioned before and these colors are really going to make the difference in your project
e6kaamscxwy_10-8-rgb_front all of these things when running projects for groups are very important things that you have to really keep in mind and take an accounting for when planning the projects
e6kaamscxwy_11-8-rgb_front so now we see our image is colored
e6kaamscxwy_12-8-rgb_front we see we chose some bright paint colors some paint markers with silver and gold colors and also we made the image nice and big
e6kaamscxwy_13-8-rgb_front not with a lot of fine details because the folds are running down the paper it is going to be hard to see any fine details
e6kaamscxwy_14-8-rgb_front we just want to have some nice big image and also you can notice how it takes up the full size of the paper from left to right and this is basically how you want to make your image
e6kaamscxwy_15-8-rgb_front so we now completed the first image that is going to be part of our reversible picture
e6kaamscxwy_2-8-rgb_front together with making the colors it is important to make the image should have some sort of outline around it
e6kaamscxwy_3-8-rgb_front so there really is no right and wrong when decorating the image but the most important thing to keep in mind is that you want it to really look colors and to make it really stand out
e6kaamscxwy_4-8-rgb_front this decorating really becomes the main part of the project so it is good to know when you are working with kids that you should choose the supplies you are going to colors and the way you decorate it carefully
e6kaamscxwy_5-8-rgb_front you will be under some time constraints and also there are different children and different age groups have different abilities
e6kaamscxwy_6-8-rgb_front some of the kids find it easier to use glue and paint and other kids find it easier just to draw freehand and apply colors right directly onto the paper
e6kaamscxwy_7-8-rgb_front now as far as getting the original image you might want to get the image beforehand and then all the kids have to do is just go ahead and decorate it with different colors
e6kaamscxwy_8-8-rgb_front that makes things a lot easier and the kids feel more comfortable when the finished product comes out to be something of more of a defined image as opposed to something that they draw on paper depending on the age group
e6kaamscxwy_9-8-rgb_front so that is also something you might want to keep in mind just to have a uniform image that is copied and then just have them decorate it
e9kegfuehmk_0-5-rgb_front okay so to center this platter onto this bat i am going to use this pen tool here
e9kegfuehmk_1-5-rgb_front and i am going to find a little spot on the base of the platter and i am going to hold this pen in it is own orbit around the edge of the platter
e9kegfuehmk_10-5-rgb_front i am going to line my fingers up again at either side and push it forward slightly like so
e9kegfuehmk_11-5-rgb_front and then check myself again
e9kegfuehmk_12-5-rgb_front okay now you can see i am pretty much moving around without leaving a gap in my circle
e9kegfuehmk_13-5-rgb_front there is a little bit of inconsistency in there but basically this is now centered
e9kegfuehmk_14-5-rgb_front so the last thing we want to do get a little bit of water on the bat so it sticks
e9kegfuehmk_15-5-rgb_front and just take some lumps of clay and simply secure the edges of the platter down
e9kegfuehmk_16-5-rgb_front notice that i am not sticking the clay to the actual platter i am sticking it to the bat and securing the edge
e9kegfuehmk_17-5-rgb_front we are going to do that in three spots around here
e9kegfuehmk_18-5-rgb_front and then the next portion of this exercise is going to be trimming this base and putting a foot on to it
e9kegfuehmk_19-5-rgb_front and we will be doing that next
e9kegfuehmk_2-5-rgb_front so i am going to turn my wheel holding it in it is own spot
e9kegfuehmk_3-5-rgb_front i am going to now start to center
e9kegfuehmk_4-5-rgb_front and you can see how i am leaving a mark on one edge of the platter
e9kegfuehmk_5-5-rgb_front i am going to find that mark and find my starting point and my end point over here
e9kegfuehmk_6-5-rgb_front i am going to line my thumbs up or my fingers on these two spots and i am simply going to push the plate forward like that
e9kegfuehmk_7-5-rgb_front and i am going to check it again
e9kegfuehmk_8-5-rgb_front still a little bit off center you can see this time our line is much larger it goes all the way around to here
e9kegfuehmk_9-5-rgb_front which means we are closer than we were before
e9uwz3kka7y_0-8-rgb_front some people say the number one enemy to a fly fisher is wind
e9uwz3kka7y_1-8-rgb_front it is not really but for this demonstration we will cover wind
e9uwz3kka7y_10-8-rgb_front so it is low come up and make your regular conventional cast because essentially the wind is going to carry it through
e9uwz3kka7y_11-8-rgb_front i will demonstrate with my hand lift flip up and make the cast
e9uwz3kka7y_12-8-rgb_front this is essentially called an elliptical or circular cast
e9uwz3kka7y_13-8-rgb_front see the elliptical motion of the hand
e9uwz3kka7y_14-8-rgb_front underneath the wind and stop and make your forward cast
e9uwz3kka7y_15-8-rgb_front now i will demonstrate
e9uwz3kka7y_16-8-rgb_front low there is our cast
e9uwz3kka7y_17-8-rgb_front see how the rod goes low
e9uwz3kka7y_18-8-rgb_front and we make our perfect stop
e9uwz3kka7y_19-8-rgb_front the wind is going to carry our forward cast
e9uwz3kka7y_2-8-rgb_front so when the wind is coming towards you you want to get underneath the wind so now i will demonstrate that for you o k
e9uwz3kka7y_20-8-rgb_front so it is and that is how we are able to fish in all types of wind
e9uwz3kka7y_21-8-rgb_front you will be a good fly fisher
e9uwz3kka7y_3-8-rgb_front we do that mainly with the body and dropping the rod
e9uwz3kka7y_4-8-rgb_front up now see how we get underneath
e9uwz3kka7y_5-8-rgb_front we go low to the ground
e9uwz3kka7y_6-8-rgb_front by doing that we cut underneath the wind
e9uwz3kka7y_7-8-rgb_front o k in relationship to the wind coming from your back we just covered what if the wind is coming to your face
e9uwz3kka7y_8-8-rgb_front o k we are going to use the same analogy now except now it is going to be in reverse
e9uwz3kka7y_9-8-rgb_front this time to beat the wind coming against our back we need to go low in our back cast come up and then go down in our forward cast
eanyqxdspsk_0-5-rgb_front i am going to be talking about motions that you can be doing in the head
eanyqxdspsk_1-5-rgb_front i am going to be pressing down and going towards the crown but i am also going to alternate it with a little bit of thumb circling going towards the crown
eanyqxdspsk_10-5-rgb_front i can do it with all fingers but in a little more gentler of a motion going towards the crown
eanyqxdspsk_11-5-rgb_front then give it a glide down
eanyqxdspsk_12-5-rgb_front always saying hello and goodbye to the head because i am doing this combing motion with the hair
eanyqxdspsk_2-5-rgb_front my fingers over here are tight
eanyqxdspsk_3-5-rgb_front they are pointing towards the ear
eanyqxdspsk_4-5-rgb_front i am just motioning in circular motions going towards the crown
eanyqxdspsk_5-5-rgb_front this can be done very light
eanyqxdspsk_6-5-rgb_front this can be done very firm but not hard
eanyqxdspsk_7-5-rgb_front it is great for headaches
eanyqxdspsk_8-5-rgb_front i am moving everything toward the crown because if there is any type of tension in the forehead area i am giving it pathway to move towards the crown
eanyqxdspsk_9-5-rgb_front this does not necessarily have to be done with the thumb
eawerqr6vtq_0-8-rgb_front here is a simple improve warm up exercise
eawerqr6vtq_1-8-rgb_front a nice icebreaker for a group
eawerqr6vtq_11-8-rgb_front so people are clapping ding ding ding ding ding around the circle and they are saying zip zap zop zip zap zop
eawerqr6vtq_12-8-rgb_front and you can see already i am just going to flub it up when you are sort of zip zap zop zop zip and then you get to celebrate every time someone makes a mistake
eawerqr6vtq_13-8-rgb_front so this is a game that should be played fast
eawerqr6vtq_14-8-rgb_front if you are playing zip zap zop zip zap you are doing something wrong
eawerqr6vtq_15-8-rgb_front so you should play it fast enough that people are messing up and that the words are getting tripped up and focus people on making eye contact with each other and delivering the word straight to them
eawerqr6vtq_16-8-rgb_front so that is the improv exercise zip zap zop
eawerqr6vtq_2-8-rgb_front called zip zap zop
eawerqr6vtq_3-8-rgb_front and one of the things good at is its good for helping people mess up in front of each other
eawerqr6vtq_4-8-rgb_front it causes for a lot of mistakes and that get people loosened up and just feeling goofy
eawerqr6vtq_5-8-rgb_front so a lot like the game pass the clap
eawerqr6vtq_6-8-rgb_front you are going to get everybody in the circle and one person is going to make eye contact with someone else in the circle and they are going to clap at them at the same time they are going to say the word zip zip o k
eawerqr6vtq_7-8-rgb_front that person is going to look at somebody else and they are going to clap at them and they are going to say zap
eawerqr6vtq_8-8-rgb_front that person is going to look at somebody else and say zop
eawerqr6vtq_9-8-rgb_front and going to start back over zip zap zop zip zap zop
ebrlzcccilg_0-3-rgb_front alright jump and justify expert here we go
ebrlzcccilg_1-3-rgb_front well welcome to the show so good to have you here
ebrlzcccilg_10-3-rgb_front well the ocean is the greatest flute player in the history of the world
ebrlzcccilg_11-3-rgb_front the waters rush into the top interact with the air much like a human lips do on the flute mouthpiece and this was an inspiration for the first flute players were listening to the ocean at the seaside
ebrlzcccilg_12-3-rgb_front oh i did not know that
ebrlzcccilg_13-3-rgb_front yes
ebrlzcccilg_14-3-rgb_front and the stock market crash
ebrlzcccilg_15-3-rgb_front was caused by flute playing yes
ebrlzcccilg_16-3-rgb_front like the pipe piper
ebrlzcccilg_17-3-rgb_front in october of nineteen a young boy whose father was a stockbroker who never paid any attention to him stood outside the wall street stock exchange and played the flute and all of the stockbrokers left out like the rats and no one was there to trade the stock and it caused the great depression
ebrlzcccilg_18-3-rgb_front that is fascinating
ebrlzcccilg_19-3-rgb_front i had no idea
ebrlzcccilg_2-3-rgb_front welcome to music to my ears
ebrlzcccilg_20-3-rgb_front now one more question
ebrlzcccilg_21-3-rgb_front sure
ebrlzcccilg_22-3-rgb_front i have heard something about my left sock
ebrlzcccilg_23-3-rgb_front ha ha
ebrlzcccilg_24-3-rgb_front your left sock is actually is a mouthpiece of your leg flute that is been surgically implanted in anticipation of today is show so if you would hold your ankle up to my mouth i will play your leg like a flute see
ebrlzcccilg_25-3-rgb_front wow well we will have to do that when we come back from break
ebrlzcccilg_26-3-rgb_front yes
ebrlzcccilg_27-3-rgb_front what a wonderful
ebrlzcccilg_28-3-rgb_front i just did not know any of that stuff about flutes and i thank you for being here today
ebrlzcccilg_29-3-rgb_front your very welcome
ebrlzcccilg_3-3-rgb_front i am your host janice willby and please let us know who you are
ebrlzcccilg_30-3-rgb_front ok scene
ebrlzcccilg_31-3-rgb_front so that is a little bit of that jump and justify expert game where we are setting up leaps in logic or information and then connecting these ideas that seem first to be disconnected
ebrlzcccilg_32-3-rgb_front and we also learned about the leg flute
ebrlzcccilg_33-3-rgb_front the leg flute
ebrlzcccilg_34-3-rgb_front so that is jump and justify expert
ebrlzcccilg_4-3-rgb_front my name is carl fudrickson and i am a world class expert in the flute
ebrlzcccilg_5-3-rgb_front carl is an expert in all things flute related
ebrlzcccilg_6-3-rgb_front tell me how did you get interested in flutes
ebrlzcccilg_7-3-rgb_front when i was a little boy my oldest sister took flute lessons and i loved the sound of her playing them so i became fascinated with this great instrument
ebrlzcccilg_8-3-rgb_front well that is nice a little family story there
ebrlzcccilg_9-3-rgb_front so tell me about the ocean
eduxnskhci8_0-5-rgb_front another thing is when you are dribbling and you have to dribble you can not catch the ball and just start walking with it unless shooting or passing
eduxnskhci8_1-5-rgb_front you have to dribble and move
eduxnskhci8_2-5-rgb_front so your choices are to dribble and then pass
eduxnskhci8_3-5-rgb_front or you can take a dribble and shoot
eduxnskhci8_4-5-rgb_front now let is just say that you catch the ball from someone and you are close in proximity to the basket you get two steps after your dribble to shoot the ball
eduxnskhci8_5-5-rgb_front so i catch the ball on the run i am jogging down and i catch the ball on the run from the time i grab the ball i get one step two steps and then i have to shoot it as a layup
eduxnskhci8_6-5-rgb_front so you get two steps after you catch the ball
eduxnskhci8_7-5-rgb_front and you can catch it on the fly which means just catch it in the air one two shot
eduxnskhci8_8-5-rgb_front or you can catch it and dribble and when you dribble once you pick up your dribble see because i am moving my foot that is one step two steps shot
eduxnskhci8_9-5-rgb_front so those are the basics of dribbling
edoxy9heaum_1-5-rgb_front our theme for today is basic pool maintenance
edoxy9heaum_2-5-rgb_front using the tailor kit will be the best way to tell our needs of our pool
edoxy9heaum_3-5-rgb_front our tailor kit will be able to tell us how much chlorine to add how much acid what our calcium levels are at and it will be able to tell us everything we need to know about what we need to add to our pool
edoxy9heaum_4-5-rgb_front using the tailor kit which is is a real simple way of being able to go to your pool professional and be able to have him explain to you what is he doing to your pool chemical with the chemistry of your pool
edoxy9heaum_5-5-rgb_front if you are using liquid acid tabs or granular it will be able to tell you how much you need to add
edoxy9heaum_6-5-rgb_front if you need to add acid to your pool based on your readings you will know how much
eghj55105um_0-5-rgb_front i am going to talk about campuses now there a handy thing to help you keep on track
eghj55105um_1-5-rgb_front there is a number of different styles of campuses and you can really get confused looking at them
eghj55105um_10-5-rgb_front so as you turn it it turns
eghj55105um_11-5-rgb_front base plate campuses has a little dial
eghj55105um_12-5-rgb_front so you have to play with it to see which style is to your preference
eghj55105um_13-5-rgb_front if you want something a little simpler you can go to ones more like this a little fish eye campus that you can just kind of pin to your pack
eghj55105um_14-5-rgb_front you just need to know which way is north south east west
eghj55105um_15-5-rgb_front this particular one is a key chain style or i have used them as zipper pulls
eghj55105um_16-5-rgb_front it has a campus but it also has a thermometer which is kind of nice when you re out on the trail to know what the temperature like
eghj55105um_17-5-rgb_front if you have any questions about campuses give your local outfitter a holler
eghj55105um_2-5-rgb_front but you really need to look at what kind of navigating your going to do
eghj55105um_3-5-rgb_front if your going to use a map my preference is some form of a base plate campus
eghj55105um_4-5-rgb_front base plate campus has a little plate and you can use that plate to line up between a couple objects on the map
eghj55105um_5-5-rgb_front there are also ones with a sighting mirror that allows you to hold it look through it like a little gun sight at an object in the distance and look at the campus at the same time
eghj55105um_6-5-rgb_front it helps you to take a bearing off of something
eghj55105um_7-5-rgb_front the downside of that for a backpacker it becomes heavier and i know it is maybe an half an ounce but backpackers think in terms of that
eghj55105um_8-5-rgb_front this right here is a lensatic campus
eghj55105um_9-5-rgb_front more of a military style nice thing about the numbers for the bearing are actually on the needle
egls5ay_tew_0-8-rgb_front another drill that will help you with ball handling which i had to learn
egls5ay_tew_1-8-rgb_front i remember having to learn is called the figure the figure drill
egls5ay_tew_2-8-rgb_front now the figure drill is different a little different than the figure dribble which we will show you next
egls5ay_tew_3-8-rgb_front but the figure drill the way you do it is you grab the ball like this and you just want to go and make a figure with the basketball inside and outside of your legs
egls5ay_tew_4-8-rgb_front so when you are doing it as you continue to do it this is a drill that as most of these ball handling drills will do your forearm you will start to feel if you are doing them like you are supposed to be doing them you will start to feel a tightening in your forearm after doing them continuously and over and over and over
egls5ay_tew_5-8-rgb_front so when you are doing the figure drill you want to get to the point where you can do it quicker and quicker and quicker and as you get quicker you will be a little bit better with handling the ball
egls5ay_tew_6-8-rgb_front now you can go outside to in like this and get faster or you can reverse it
egls5ay_tew_7-8-rgb_front and as you reverse it which is usually a little bit harder you actually get better with the figure dribble which i am going to show you a little bit later
egls5ay_tew_8-8-rgb_front showing you the figure drill
ehw7fc4iqti_0-5-rgb_front pearling happens when a kayaker comes down the face of a wave and hits a current straight on causing the water to build up on the bow of the boat pushing the paddler vertical
ehw7fc4iqti_1-5-rgb_front what we want to do to avoid pearling is keep our boat on edge and keep carving to the side of the wave and avoid coming too far down the wave in order to not get a big deflection off the wave as well
ehw7fc4iqti_2-5-rgb_front pearling can happen at any point that your bow is right in line with the current and going to happen the easiest when you get at the trough of the wave in the bottom
ehw7fc4iqti_3-5-rgb_front so if down in the trough you want to be on edge and sideways to the current so that you get pulled back up the wave to avoid pearling
ei1zf6vsm-g_0-8-rgb_front so there are sometimes when you do not want to be doing stretches on your horse
ei1zf6vsm-g_1-8-rgb_front if your horse is very very tired and their muscles are already overly tired then stretching them at that point is not probably going to be a huge benefit to them
ei1zf6vsm-g_2-8-rgb_front it could just make a bad situation even worse
ei1zf6vsm-g_3-8-rgb_front and again if your horse is cold or if it is very cold outside and it is hard to get your horse warmed up you need to be real careful doing stretches at that time
ei1zf6vsm-g_4-8-rgb_front if your horse is injured before you try doing stretches you want to again make sure that you have your vet is clearance on this that there are not any contraindications
ei1zf6vsm-g_5-8-rgb_front if your horse is cranky you do not want to be trying to do stretches on them then they are going to resent it they are going to pull away from you and perhaps injure themselves or inure you
ei1zf6vsm-g_6-8-rgb_front and above all in all the work that you are doing with your horse you want it to be a positive experience for both you and the horse
ei1zf6vsm-g_7-8-rgb_front if you are feeling distracted or tired yourself or like if you do not have enough time to be working on it then it is best to not do it
ei1zf6vsm-g_8-8-rgb_front it is best to just spend a little time with your horse enjoying them and not asking them to do things that they might not want to do
ei9bnfa07x4_0-8-rgb_front okay so now we are going to prepare the bat for the wheel
ei9bnfa07x4_1-8-rgb_front and attach the clay to the bat so that we can start centering
ei9bnfa07x4_10-8-rgb_front if it is too wet the clay will just simply slide off it and you will not get it to adhere to the bat
ei9bnfa07x4_11-8-rgb_front if the bat is dry it also will not stick
ei9bnfa07x4_12-8-rgb_front so what we do is we take a sponge and we just wet down the bat
ei9bnfa07x4_13-8-rgb_front and then i take my towel here and i just run it across
ei9bnfa07x4_14-8-rgb_front and now you can see we have a nice surface to attach the clay to we also have created a little ring here so that when we lay the clay down on the bat we can see it is almost centered just sitting there
ei9bnfa07x4_15-8-rgb_front attaching the clay we want to take the clay in both hands line it up and smack it down
ei9bnfa07x4_16-8-rgb_front okay so now we are prepared the bat and attached the clay
ei9bnfa07x4_17-8-rgb_front the next step is centering our lump of clay to make our plant pot
ei9bnfa07x4_18-8-rgb_front and we will be doing that next
ei9bnfa07x4_2-8-rgb_front first thing we are going to do is look on the bottom of the bat and we have these two sets of little holes here
ei9bnfa07x4_3-8-rgb_front and they are going to correspond with these pins that are on the wheel
ei9bnfa07x4_4-8-rgb_front we are going to attach this
ei9bnfa07x4_5-8-rgb_front now it is very important to have the right surface to stick the clay to and having a pot there is obviously been a pot that is been thrown on here
ei9bnfa07x4_6-8-rgb_front and there is still some nice wet clay on there
ei9bnfa07x4_7-8-rgb_front this would be a great surface to attach the clay to however we often do not have that
ei9bnfa07x4_8-8-rgb_front so i am just going to trim this off and show you what you need to do to prepare the bat
ei9bnfa07x4_9-8-rgb_front the bat needs to be a little bit wet but not too wet
eiomy6ub-i0_1-5-rgb_front i have my meat here
eiomy6ub-i0_10-5-rgb_front i did not do that
eiomy6ub-i0_11-5-rgb_front my mom does that
eiomy6ub-i0_12-5-rgb_front she selects her own pieces of meat and she does that
eiomy6ub-i0_13-5-rgb_front i just buy precut predone in the market
eiomy6ub-i0_14-5-rgb_front i am trying to mix all the sauce and the meat together
eiomy6ub-i0_15-5-rgb_front all the sauce and the meat so we can have a nice amount stirring it over and over again
eiomy6ub-i0_2-5-rgb_front look how it is now boiling like that
eiomy6ub-i0_3-5-rgb_front i am going to place my meat in here and put it all together
eiomy6ub-i0_4-5-rgb_front mixing it all up good
eiomy6ub-i0_5-5-rgb_front i am going to put in here like this and mix it up
eiomy6ub-i0_6-5-rgb_front look at that
eiomy6ub-i0_7-5-rgb_front make sure that you mix it real well because the meats were separate
eiomy6ub-i0_8-5-rgb_front if you were doing that grinding like i said before if you were grinding your own meat
eiomy6ub-i0_9-5-rgb_front if you had selected your meat and grind it together then you would not have to do that
ejiefdrw4hm_0-8-rgb_front now the first thing that you need to do even in a large group no matter how difficult it is are learn the students names
ejiefdrw4hm_1-8-rgb_front it is very important that you learn their names and that you are able to identify them by name
ejiefdrw4hm_10-8-rgb_front another option which is not one of my all time favorites but it works for certain settings and certain classrooms is to have the students state their names before they ask a question or before they speak or when they are called on in class
ejiefdrw4hm_11-8-rgb_front something else that i have tried that i have had a lot of success with is when i am learning students names if i get their name wrong i have to take them out for a cup of coffee and they really like that
ejiefdrw4hm_12-8-rgb_front the probably the most important thing about learning names is the willingness to look foolish
ejiefdrw4hm_13-8-rgb_front the willingness to call becky kathy thirteen times in a row before you get it right
ejiefdrw4hm_14-8-rgb_front but i cannot stress how important it is for you to learn your students names and give them an individuality in your classroom where they are more than just a number
ejiefdrw4hm_2-8-rgb_front well you say how can i learn two hundred students names or more
ejiefdrw4hm_3-8-rgb_front well there is some several things that you could do
ejiefdrw4hm_4-8-rgb_front obviously the first one is name tags which is my least favorite but it is certainly an option
ejiefdrw4hm_5-8-rgb_front you can also consider tents name tents
ejiefdrw4hm_6-8-rgb_front if you teach in a classroom or you are established in a classroom where there is some desks or large tables put up name tents
ejiefdrw4hm_7-8-rgb_front my favorite thing to do is to have every student give me a photograph of themselves on a three by five index card with their name written on it
ejiefdrw4hm_8-8-rgb_front and that way i can look through the cards and i can learn to put names with faces
ejiefdrw4hm_9-8-rgb_front something else that you can do is you can promise to your students that you will learn their names and then that puts a lot of pressure on you because you do not want to break your promise
ej_g_koahj0_0-3-rgb_front these are river rescue ropes it is always important to bring a rope you never want to be caught without a rope cause they can save lives
ej_g_koahj0_1-3-rgb_front conversely you want to know how to use it cause you do not want to have a rope in the river while someone is swimming down there and not knowing it or paddling down
ej_g_koahj0_2-3-rgb_front there is a couple different kinds of ropes this is pretty common rescue bag it is made by annerise contains about feet of rope this particular type of rope is polyester polypropylene and this type of rope floats in water so that when you do throw it someone can easily see it it is also bright yellow so that they can see it
ej_g_koahj0_3-3-rgb_front but it also has a little stretch to it there is another type of rope that is made out of nylon it has less stretch to it that you can use for a certain mechanical systems to get pin boats off of rocks and other situations like that
ej_g_koahj0_4-3-rgb_front when ropes are thrown the rope comes out of the bag evenly and it is not cause it is coiled in there it is because it is actually stuffed in there
ej_g_koahj0_5-3-rgb_front so when you repack a rope bag you want to make sure it is stuffed loosely so that it comes out loosely
ej_g_koahj0_6-3-rgb_front this is a typical type of rope that you would find with most kayaker is groups pretty standard and pretty normal this type of rope also incorporates a rescue belt it has a pocket here goes around the waist clips on where the clip release strap so that if you happen to have a boat next to you can pull out the carol beaner clip it onto the boat and once it is on the boat a length of rope comes out so that you can pull a boat to shore or help the person to shore then you can release it if it is pulling you to to hard
ej_g_koahj0_7-3-rgb_front it also can be used just as a rescue bag when it is not clipped to you you can throw it to the person in the water
ejlvf2d4p-i_1-5-rgb_front in this clip we are going to be talking more about tea accessories
ejlvf2d4p-i_10-5-rgb_front this is also very nice this is a tea sock which also you can use for any kind of tea
ejlvf2d4p-i_11-5-rgb_front it only changes the color and you have to just wash it with hot water
ejlvf2d4p-i_2-5-rgb_front another type of accessory would be a teapot which already comes with the infuser in it
ejlvf2d4p-i_3-5-rgb_front so you really do not have to buy a separate infuser
ejlvf2d4p-i_4-5-rgb_front so your tea buy this teapot and you are all set
ejlvf2d4p-i_5-5-rgb_front but if you want to go separate ways then you can actually buy an infuser that suits you
ejlvf2d4p-i_6-5-rgb_front you can buy an infuser a smaller size that is for a cut that is for teaspoon
ejlvf2d4p-i_7-5-rgb_front you can buy an infuser if you want to make a pitcher it is a little bit bigger
ejlvf2d4p-i_8-5-rgb_front or if you think your tea is very very fine then i think you need to buy an infuser which is finer in quality and it is deep down it is going to steep your tea very nicely
ejlvf2d4p-i_9-5-rgb_front besides all these we also have a tea sock which you can use
ejyzbukikk8_0-1-rgb_front joe wiles we are counting down our top most downloaded internet guitar tabs and coming in at number is thunderstruck by
ejyzbukikk8_1-1-rgb_front let is take a look
ejyzbukikk8_10-1-rgb_front open open open open open open open open
ejyzbukikk8_11-1-rgb_front now we are going to move this two fingers up so we are doing and now
ejyzbukikk8_12-1-rgb_front open open open open open open open open
ejyzbukikk8_13-1-rgb_front we will just go back and forth between those two positions
ejyzbukikk8_14-1-rgb_front now if you are watching my right hand i am muting out the g string with my thumb and the high e string with another finger so that in case i hit it with my left hand it does not ring out
ejyzbukikk8_15-1-rgb_front and slowly together they sound like this
ejyzbukikk8_16-1-rgb_front and you just repeat
ejyzbukikk8_17-1-rgb_front to speed it sound like this
ejyzbukikk8_18-1-rgb_front i hope you will join us for our next segment which is our last segment in this video set
ejyzbukikk8_19-1-rgb_front i will see you there
ejyzbukikk8_2-1-rgb_front now this is a really good pull off exercise okay
ejyzbukikk8_3-1-rgb_front it is all going to occur on the b
ejyzbukikk8_4-1-rgb_front what we are going to do is we are going to with our index finger to the fret
ejyzbukikk8_5-1-rgb_front we are going to pull it up to the sorry the fret
ejyzbukikk8_6-1-rgb_front so to
ejyzbukikk8_7-1-rgb_front pull off fret pull off open open
ejyzbukikk8_9-1-rgb_front i will tell you that slowly with me
ek4b85cnkoo_0-8-rgb_front there is a pretty large variety of tools available for trimming your cat is nails
ek4b85cnkoo_1-8-rgb_front the trick is finding something that you are comfortable with and sticking with it
ek4b85cnkoo_10-8-rgb_front so a cat with a larger nail you can actually get the whole nail in there but still have good control so you are not cutting the nail too short
ek4b85cnkoo_11-8-rgb_front and here is a larger brand of nail trimmers that you could use if you have cats and small dogs
ek4b85cnkoo_12-8-rgb_front this is a good all purpose nail trimmer that will trim a thicker harder dog is nail as well as trimming your cats nail
ek4b85cnkoo_13-8-rgb_front and it actually has a little guard here that you can put in place and a lock on it to keep it from getting damaged
ek4b85cnkoo_14-8-rgb_front this is called a guillotine type nail trimmer a lot of people use these for cats and dogs too
ek4b85cnkoo_15-8-rgb_front and you can see how as you flex the handle this blade comes up and trims the nail off
ek4b85cnkoo_16-8-rgb_front a lot of people like these
ek4b85cnkoo_17-8-rgb_front i find them difficult because i always cut the nails a little bit shorter than i was expecting to cut them
ek4b85cnkoo_2-8-rgb_front some people use regular human nail trimmers
ek4b85cnkoo_3-8-rgb_front i find them a little bit uncomfortable because they trim you know our nails are flat and cats nails go sideways
ek4b85cnkoo_4-8-rgb_front so i am always having a little bit of trouble using them because i feel like i am using them sideways
ek4b85cnkoo_5-8-rgb_front but some people find them very effective
ek4b85cnkoo_6-8-rgb_front there are also these very small jawed nail trimmers which are quite tiny and easy very easy for some people to use
ek4b85cnkoo_7-8-rgb_front they are not personally my favorites but i know a lot of people enjoy these
ek4b85cnkoo_8-8-rgb_front these types of trimmers are my favorite
ek4b85cnkoo_9-8-rgb_front they have a little bit of a wider jaw in them
ekwp0bql7g4_0-8-rgb_front so as i get ready to descend the first thing on my mind is trying to decide how much harder gearing i need
ekwp0bql7g4_1-8-rgb_front because this descent coming up i have ridden before and i know it is pretty short and i start going uphill after it i probably am only going to change gears in the rear
ekwp0bql7g4_2-8-rgb_front so i will shift down two or three gears for my climbing gear just to have a little bit of extra purchase when i am on the descents to create some more speed and take it from there
ekwp0bql7g4_3-8-rgb_front so one two three shifts and boom i am there
ekwp0bql7g4_4-8-rgb_front if it was a considerably longer descent where i knew i would be descending for seven or eight minutes i would probably also take this now as an opportunity to shift into the bigger chain ring up front
ekwp0bql7g4_5-8-rgb_front right side is the rear for both the brakes and the shifting left side is the front so i would shift myself into the harder chain ring up front
ekwp0bql7g4_6-8-rgb_front it is like there is a two or three tooth difference between each cog in the back of your bike there is a ten tooth difference in the front
ekwp0bql7g4_7-8-rgb_front so depending on how much your speed is going to be changing that is how you decide which gear to use
ekwp0bql7g4_8-8-rgb_front one nice thing about putting it into the bigger harder gear up front is that it puts more tension on the chain so it rattles around less when you are descending makes less of a clanking noise and everything like that as you can see here right now my bike is in the little chain ring so there is a lot of potential for the chain flapping around but as i put it into the larger chain ring you will see that there is considerably more tension on the chain
ekwp0bql7g4_9-8-rgb_front the chain is farther from the chain stays less likely to slap around and everything like that so you are more likely to have your chain when you get to the bottom of the descent if you put it into a harder gear
emhscu5bckc_0-5-rgb_front alright continuing on about gossip i ended the last clip by telling you do not do it
emhscu5bckc_1-5-rgb_front so you are saying to yourself well how do i not do it
emhscu5bckc_10-5-rgb_front or you can just not be associated with the gossipers and that may be the best choice of all
emhscu5bckc_2-5-rgb_front how do i not gossip when everybody at work is gossiping
emhscu5bckc_3-5-rgb_front or if i do not gossip i will not be in the in group
emhscu5bckc_4-5-rgb_front well everybody wants to be in the in group and i understand that so the key to not gossiping is being diplomatic in your refusal to participate in the gossip and you have several ways in which you can do this
emhscu5bckc_5-5-rgb_front if you are a pretty direct bold person you can simply make a statement i do not want to talk about them they are not here to defend themselves
emhscu5bckc_6-5-rgb_front okay
emhscu5bckc_7-5-rgb_front if you talk like that you will get a reputation really quick that not to gossip around you because you do not involve yourself in the gossip
emhscu5bckc_8-5-rgb_front another thing that you can do if you want to try to stay with a certain group of people or in an in group maybe you do not say to them i do not want to talk about them i do not want to gossip they are not here to defend themselves but perhaps you can continually change the subject
emhscu5bckc_9-5-rgb_front that is another option that is probably a little subtler than stating to whoever is gossiping that you do not want to talk about that person behind their back but those are a couple of options
en2mmgil37o_0-5-rgb_front in this clip i would like to talk to you some more about some safety when you are wood turning
en2mmgil37o_1-5-rgb_front it is very important for you to wear a dust mask because wood dust has been identified as a known carcinogen by the government
en2mmgil37o_2-5-rgb_front so when i am turning and especially when i am sanding i want to wear a dust mask or something to keep me from breathing in those chips and the things that i can not see which are the ones that will get into my lungs
en2mmgil37o_3-5-rgb_front i also make sure that i use a dust collector to collect the chips and i try to get the dust collector hose as close to the material that i am working on as possible so that everything goes into the dust collector and is filtered into the bag
en2mmgil37o_4-5-rgb_front another thing i always use when i am working in the shop is this air filter
en2mmgil37o_5-5-rgb_front and it helps clear what does not get picked up by the dust collector
en2mmgil37o_6-5-rgb_front and i usually keep this running for quite a while after i get done to make sure that it circulates and cleans the air out
en2mmgil37o_7-5-rgb_front another thing that i like to use is a face shield respirator combo
en2mmgil37o_8-5-rgb_front this is a face shield that also has a respirator with it and by wearing this i do not have to wear this
eoczdl-1dow_0-1-rgb_front what i have in my hands here now is a milk snake this particular guy is part of the colubridae family as all milk snakes are
eoczdl-1dow_1-1-rgb_front there is two different types of snake boyd is and colubridae is in the reptile family
eoczdl-1dow_10-1-rgb_front they get about four to six feet at adult size and like i said tend to be a little nervous but this guy is being very well behaved
eoczdl-1dow_11-1-rgb_front usually they are kind of quick to poop on you when you handle them or to try to run away but this one is being very very nice today
eoczdl-1dow_12-1-rgb_front other things to note on colubridae is they do not have the heat pits like boyd is do and pythons particular
eoczdl-1dow_13-1-rgb_front there is that heat sensing apparatus is not there they do not sense heat as well
eoczdl-1dow_14-1-rgb_front there much more of a smelling snake with that tongue and the jacobson is organ like we talked about before
eoczdl-1dow_2-1-rgb_front the colubridae is tend to be a thinner faster snake than the boyd is are
eoczdl-1dow_3-1-rgb_front this one in particular is trying very hard to do some mimicry coloration and look a awful lot like a coral snake which is a highly venomous snake in the south america type region
eoczdl-1dow_4-1-rgb_front the coral snake has a similar color and pattern perhaps you have heard the rhyme red touches yellow kills a fellow red touches black a venom lack
eoczdl-1dow_5-1-rgb_front this is in response to the colors of the coral snake verses the milk snake
eoczdl-1dow_6-1-rgb_front the coral snake is bands are red yellow black as opposed to red black yellow on this particular milk snake
eoczdl-1dow_7-1-rgb_front now again any snake in the wild should be treated as a dangerous snake until properly identified
eoczdl-1dow_8-1-rgb_front some coral snakes do not follow that coloration rule so always be careful when you are ever handling a snake like this out of the wild but i know this is a milk snake it is been a captive born snake
eoczdl-1dow_9-1-rgb_front usually these guys are tend to be a little bit flighty though this one is being very very well behaved for me
eqk8auvlgxw_0-5-rgb_front we are going to talk about the different products that make framing molding
eqk8auvlgxw_1-5-rgb_front one of the things that they use as wood they use several different kinds of wood
eqk8auvlgxw_10-5-rgb_front when i say many years at least a hundred if it is taking care of properly
eqk8auvlgxw_2-5-rgb_front mostly every wood out there
eqk8auvlgxw_3-5-rgb_front it is hard to determine what each one is without really knowing your woods
eqk8auvlgxw_4-5-rgb_front this happens to be a piece of oak it is very hard it is very not it is hard to destroy it is hard to dent it is hard to chip
eqk8auvlgxw_5-5-rgb_front you can tell it is wood by looking at the edge of it here
eqk8auvlgxw_6-5-rgb_front you can tell that it is wood by looking at the back of it
eqk8auvlgxw_7-5-rgb_front if you look at this one you can tell this one is not wood and that this is
eqk8auvlgxw_8-5-rgb_front wood is something that is going to give you a long life a shelf life
eqk8auvlgxw_9-5-rgb_front it is going to hang around for many years to come
erlk5vrbfny_0-3-rgb_front hi in this segment we are going to talk about the staker throw
erlk5vrbfny_1-3-rgb_front it is a different type of throw
erlk5vrbfny_2-3-rgb_front it is very similar to the backhand but it is actually a little bit different grip
erlk5vrbfny_3-3-rgb_front so the staker throw you are actually going to throw it with just this part of your hand
erlk5vrbfny_4-3-rgb_front you are going to come in and just pinch the frisbee on the inside like this with the index finger and the thumb and you are going to hold the frisbee flat and hold it under your chin and then release here here
erlk5vrbfny_5-3-rgb_front so this is the grip and if i am going to toss it to ryan i would hold it in and that is the staker throw
erlk5vrbfny_6-3-rgb_front you can also put some spin on the staker throw by holding it a little bit lower and snapping your wrist so this is a staker throw with spin and you can also throw that same release for distance you can throw it a little bit farther with that release so that is the staker throw give it a shot it is a real easy throw to throw
es58mongmko_0-8-rgb_front this advanced pilates exercise is called the hot potato so i want you to really think about your feet being really hot so you have got to bounce back and forth
es58mongmko_1-8-rgb_front come on down to your side rest your head on your arm draw your belly in naval to spine
es58mongmko_2-8-rgb_front your hips are stacked one on top of the other now lift your top leg and point your toes lift your bottom leg up to meet your top leg and down
es58mongmko_3-8-rgb_front now this is just getting used to the movement of lifting your leg up and down and then moving into hot potato keep your leg up and take your leg in front and back front back
es58mongmko_4-8-rgb_front now your top leg is still while the bottom leg moves forward and back in front of the leg behind the leg and you are really going to feet your inner thighs work here
es58mongmko_5-8-rgb_front your core is engaged that top leg is stabilized and lengthen out through those toes and when you complete about to reps then switch and go to the other side and that is hot potato
es8qabyodu0_0-9-rgb_front okay the next defense drill we will discuss is on the ball defense
es8qabyodu0_1-9-rgb_front when the ball is picked up by your defender whether they are getting ready to pass or shoot it what you want to do as soon as the ball is picked up you need to be all up on them in their face
es8qabyodu0_10-9-rgb_front and this is on the ball defense once the ball is picked up
es8qabyodu0_11-9-rgb_front so just remember from your stance position as soon as the ball is picked up you are here all up on them
es8qabyodu0_12-9-rgb_front hands in the face hands up crowding the space
es8qabyodu0_13-9-rgb_front do not let them see anything or get a pass away or a shot away
es8qabyodu0_14-9-rgb_front and this is proper on the ball defense when the ball is picked up by your opponent
es8qabyodu0_2-9-rgb_front hands up hands in the face to block their view from passing or shooting
es8qabyodu0_3-9-rgb_front and wherever they take the ball one hand needs to be there
es8qabyodu0_4-9-rgb_front if the ball goes to their left side put the hand by the ball and keep one hand in the face
es8qabyodu0_5-9-rgb_front same with the opposite side
es8qabyodu0_6-9-rgb_front keep one hand in the face and the ball here
es8qabyodu0_7-9-rgb_front so remember to their space as much as possible as soon as they pick up the ball so they can not move they can not look or anything
es8qabyodu0_8-9-rgb_front and do not forget the distraction
es8qabyodu0_9-9-rgb_front because all that is good too
eskkvqazvhk_1-5-rgb_front now we can lower the vehicle slightly so that the weight of the vehicle would be held by the jack stands and also by the jack
eskkvqazvhk_2-5-rgb_front so very slowly lower some of the weight off of the floor jack onto the jack stands and check it again
eskkvqazvhk_3-5-rgb_front okay that looks good
eskkvqazvhk_4-5-rgb_front that looks not as good
eskkvqazvhk_5-5-rgb_front i am going to raise it back up just a little bit and reposition this other floor jack
eskkvqazvhk_6-5-rgb_front okay that looks good that looks good
eskkvqazvhk_7-5-rgb_front so the floor jacks are now properly positioned under the frame members and the weight is being held by the jack stands but i also like to leave the floor jack in place also so that if something goes wrong i will not be crushed by the vehicle
eskkvqazvhk_8-5-rgb_front if you are ever working on a car and you have a spare tire many times it is good to put a spare tire just underneath the vehicle somewhat so that if the car does fall at least it is not going to smash you flat
eskkvqazvhk_9-5-rgb_front so anyway we will keep the jack in position and the two floor jacks are also in position for additional safety
eszxqqugh1a_0-5-rgb_front now there are some positives to impromptu speaking so a lot of times you even mention that impromptu word and a speaker or a person will panic
eszxqqugh1a_1-5-rgb_front impromptu is in my opinion the most difficult and the success of you as an impromptu speaker depends on your public speaking skills
eszxqqugh1a_10-5-rgb_front you do not have any notes you do not have anything to hold so you can practice your gesturing
eszxqqugh1a_11-5-rgb_front you do not want to or
eszxqqugh1a_12-5-rgb_front another positive thing is organizational skills
eszxqqugh1a_13-5-rgb_front you have to work in the moment on your organizational skills and good public speakers are very organized but you do not have any notes to follow so you have to logically think as you go about how i want to present this
eszxqqugh1a_14-5-rgb_front what is the organizational pattern
eszxqqugh1a_15-5-rgb_front also it is a good way to practice moving around
eszxqqugh1a_16-5-rgb_front if i have no notes and i am not limited to some kind of podium or any kind of restrictions i can practice walking around
eszxqqugh1a_17-5-rgb_front so those are some of the benefits and good things that can come out of impromptu speaking
eszxqqugh1a_2-5-rgb_front so actually as the more you do it and the more your practice your public speaking skills the more successful you are going to be at impromptu speaking
eszxqqugh1a_3-5-rgb_front but impromptu speaking itself helps you practice a number of things that are really important for public speaking
eszxqqugh1a_4-5-rgb_front first of all eye contact
eszxqqugh1a_5-5-rgb_front if i do not have any notes to look at i do not have a script to read then i have no excuse no reason not to work on my eye contact with my audience
eszxqqugh1a_6-5-rgb_front also responding to feedback
eszxqqugh1a_7-5-rgb_front i do not have any notes i do not have any guidelines i do not have any outline i do not have anything so i have to respond to feedback in the moment
eszxqqugh1a_8-5-rgb_front you ask me the question i think about it i respond
eszxqqugh1a_9-5-rgb_front also gesturing
etthxmc1tco_1-5-rgb_front as an example we will start off using the belt that is here on my jacket
etthxmc1tco_10-5-rgb_front it is going to make the waist look smaller
etthxmc1tco_11-5-rgb_front and also draw you eyes especially to that area with the shine and the silver
etthxmc1tco_12-5-rgb_front this is a belt that would not necessarily fit in your belt loops but you can wear it over sweaters over dresses and then on the outside of a pair of pants possibly even a high waisted pair for this one
etthxmc1tco_13-5-rgb_front join us in the next segment we are going to be talking about hats
etthxmc1tco_2-5-rgb_front buying a jacket that comes with a belt such as this is going to give the jacket a little bit more definition in the waist and is going to give you a little bit more of a figure
etthxmc1tco_3-5-rgb_front the belt that we have here is pretty versatile this one is going to work well with jeans
etthxmc1tco_4-5-rgb_front or you might play around with it and put it over a dress a red dress a black dress to give it a little bit of a waist definition
etthxmc1tco_5-5-rgb_front it is going to draw the eye to that area of the body
etthxmc1tco_6-5-rgb_front this is another pretty versatile belt here it has a little extra accessory in the chain
etthxmc1tco_7-5-rgb_front when you wear something such as this make sure that your accessories match it
etthxmc1tco_8-5-rgb_front so this is going to set the tone for the rest of the jewelry that you are going to be wearing you would want to stick with silver
etthxmc1tco_9-5-rgb_front finally we have kind of a fun belt this one is a little bit bigger
eumcnlp5jns_0-5-rgb_front we are going to be beginning the italic capital letters
eumcnlp5jns_1-5-rgb_front now the italic capitals are based on a particular proportion scale and i would like to show you that
eumcnlp5jns_10-5-rgb_front so you will need to have some paper
eumcnlp5jns_11-5-rgb_front i use gridded paper
eumcnlp5jns_12-5-rgb_front you are going to need a straight edge or a ruler a pencil and some sort of writing instrument
eumcnlp5jns_2-5-rgb_front that is the letters are all eight pen widths tall
eumcnlp5jns_3-5-rgb_front i am going to be working with a pen
eumcnlp5jns_4-5-rgb_front i am using a size which is an eighth of an inch
eumcnlp5jns_5-5-rgb_front you can use either a dip pen as i am using or you can use a marker pen
eumcnlp5jns_6-5-rgb_front but the letters should be measured and you should give yourself guidelines where i have made a stack of eight pen widths and that is going to be the height of my letters
eumcnlp5jns_7-5-rgb_front so if i make an italic b it is going to fit into this space just like that
eumcnlp5jns_8-5-rgb_front hopefully with a little more ink in the pen
eumcnlp5jns_9-5-rgb_front so we are going to be starting there
eup1a-9q2aa_0-8-rgb_front this is an improv icebreaker called pass the clap
eup1a-9q2aa_1-8-rgb_front okay insert your naughty joke here
eup1a-9q2aa_10-8-rgb_front and if i was to start i am going to make eye contact with someone in the circle and i am going to clap at them
eup1a-9q2aa_11-8-rgb_front thus passing the clap
eup1a-9q2aa_12-8-rgb_front once they get it they are going to make eye contact with someone and they are going to clap at them
eup1a-9q2aa_13-8-rgb_front and this clap is going to be whizzing around the circle
eup1a-9q2aa_14-8-rgb_front as with all improv games one of the things we want to work on is pacing
eup1a-9q2aa_15-8-rgb_front the faster you go the more challenging and exciting it will be
eup1a-9q2aa_16-8-rgb_front that is where the risk is that is where the fun is
eup1a-9q2aa_17-8-rgb_front so hopefully it is going really fast
eup1a-9q2aa_18-8-rgb_front passing back and forth
eup1a-9q2aa_19-8-rgb_front zoom zoom zoom around the circle
eup1a-9q2aa_2-8-rgb_front alright it is pass the clap
eup1a-9q2aa_20-8-rgb_front if that gets a little boring then what you can do is you can start moving around the room and clapping at people as people are moving around and that can give a whole other kind of movement dynamic
eup1a-9q2aa_21-8-rgb_front the focus is for this game is pacing and eye contact
eup1a-9q2aa_22-8-rgb_front making sure you really connect with people and deliver the clap right to them
eup1a-9q2aa_23-8-rgb_front so that is a classic improv warm up called pass the clap
eup1a-9q2aa_3-8-rgb_front it is simple it is classic
eup1a-9q2aa_4-8-rgb_front it is so portable
eup1a-9q2aa_5-8-rgb_front you can use it any time
eup1a-9q2aa_6-8-rgb_front i learned it in one of my first improv classes and fifteen years later i am still doing it today
eup1a-9q2aa_7-8-rgb_front pass the clap
eup1a-9q2aa_8-8-rgb_front so this just helps people get connected and really in the moment with each other and how it works is you are going to get a group in a circle
eup1a-9q2aa_9-8-rgb_front the classic improv formation
eugipi7-aqo_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to talk about cooking the macrobiotic way
eugipi7-aqo_2-8-rgb_front so this is the vegetable part of the meal and in macrobiotics we actually catorgorize vegetables into three groups we have the root vegetables the ground vegetable and the leafy greens
eugipi7-aqo_3-8-rgb_front so this is root and ground vegetables here
eugipi7-aqo_4-8-rgb_front we have lewdest root is good for the lungs and large intestines that is organ pair and organ medicine
eugipi7-aqo_5-8-rgb_front here the root itself here is cross section of it when it is sliced
eugipi7-aqo_6-8-rgb_front we have deacon root which a root vegetable its a root vegetable that is really good for flushing out fat and toxins
eugipi7-aqo_7-8-rgb_front it is a natural dietetics so its good for people who have water retention
eugipi7-aqo_8-8-rgb_front this is fresh burdock root burdock root cleanses and strengthening the blood and we use this a lot in our cooking
eugipi7-aqo_9-8-rgb_front and then we varies other root vegetables and ground vegetables we have butter nuts squash we have kobocha squash we have rootabaga we have fresh ginger root we have cauliflower broccoli and here they are all cut up and fresh bach chow and baby bach chow here they are all cut up
eukba7h9vgm_0-5-rgb_front so in my hand is a fiber based print and when you look at this print and you see it you are automatically like well what is going on with it
eukba7h9vgm_1-5-rgb_front it looks like it is ruined or damaged or something
eukba7h9vgm_2-5-rgb_front fiber based prints will curl up like this exactly like this and this is perfectly normal
eukba7h9vgm_3-5-rgb_front so what you want to do when you have a print like this is a couple of different things
eukba7h9vgm_4-5-rgb_front one you could use a press like i have right beside me which we are going to use in a few minutes or you could actually flatten this print using i have seen people use heavy encyclopedias books i have seen people also make a little contraption where they will take wood and felt and just screw it down with some bolts two pieces of wood
eukba7h9vgm_5-5-rgb_front i like using a press
eukba7h9vgm_6-5-rgb_front these presses are fairly expensive they can cost a couple hundred dollars but they are a vital part of a darkroom
eukba7h9vgm_7-5-rgb_front sometimes if you can find other friends who have a press press is pretty important
eukba7h9vgm_8-5-rgb_front the other thing before you press your print you want to make sure that this print is totally dry
eukba7h9vgm_9-5-rgb_front now a fiber based print can take up to twenty four hours to dry depending on the humidity of your darkroom so do not ever try to put a wet print in a press
eutzatstdh4_0-5-rgb_front we talked about what blood pressure is and how blood pressure fits into the jnc guidelines
eutzatstdh4_1-5-rgb_front a little bit later we will be talking about how to appropriately treat high blood pressure with diet and exercise but first we want to talk about why you actually want to change your blood pressure who really cares
eutzatstdh4_2-5-rgb_front what is the importance of it
eutzatstdh4_3-5-rgb_front we are going to use these models for an example but basically there are two reasons blood pressure is important
eutzatstdh4_4-5-rgb_front one is that the heart muscle is basically like a band and when that band is continuously overstretched like this just like a rubber band eventually that stretch wears out
eutzatstdh4_5-5-rgb_front so the elasticity in the heart tissue wears out and that is when you run into problems with things like congestive heart failure where you no longer have the ability to pump blood to the rest of your body
eutzatstdh4_6-5-rgb_front this takes years to happen and over time it can happen with just slight elevations
eutzatstdh4_7-5-rgb_front that is one of the reasons blood pressure is so important
eutzatstdh4_8-5-rgb_front next we are going to be talking about the other reason blood pressure is important and that is it is role in arterial sclerosis
evy2te5bv_a_1-5-rgb_front this is rear facing only seat it is designed to put in the base and to dine where you install the base
evy2te5bv_a_2-5-rgb_front this part in the vehicle and this part is removable
evy2te5bv_a_3-5-rgb_front this seat is used for convenience so that you can put this in your stroller you can take in and out of the house it is a good way to carry the baby in and out
evy2te5bv_a_4-5-rgb_front it is very important with new borns because they have to head and neck control they must be at the proper angle and that angle is defined by the seat manufacturers degrees that keeps the head from flopping forward and shutting off the air way
evy2te5bv_a_5-5-rgb_front unfortunately vehicle seats are designed for adult passenger comfort so they usually have a pretty good seat slope which is getting that angle so what you need to do is the type of base that you are using they have a adjustment like this this is a spring loaded foot to where you can composite for that seat slope
evy2te5bv_a_6-5-rgb_front this one actually has a built in level system as you can see it has a level for the proper position so you would be just positioning it with the foot raising to the point where the level on in this case it is between the two arrows
evy2te5bv_a_7-5-rgb_front then you would install it and then when your seat is in the base your going to have that degree angle and you do not have to worry about the infant head falling forward
exabap-jk6e_0-5-rgb_front with the sweat glands in your feet there is approximately nine thousand in each foot
exabap-jk6e_1-5-rgb_front we discussed that you eliminate toxins from your sweat from your breath and different areas
exabap-jk6e_10-5-rgb_front we pour it down a drain
exabap-jk6e_2-5-rgb_front we have a treatment that we use an ionic charge which is a very slight regulated electronic charge through salt water and it helps pull out waste products from the sweat in your feet through the sweat glands
exabap-jk6e_3-5-rgb_front the different colors that are distributed in the water there may be an amber color it may be black it may have a floating foam and these different colors and these different elements that appear in water which originally started out clear are waste products from your circulatory system
exabap-jk6e_4-5-rgb_front your blood goes through your feet every seven minutes so to think that it also helps clean your blood
exabap-jk6e_5-5-rgb_front we use this treatment on people that have foot pain that have planter fasciitis and also have general aches and pains and it helps detoxify and helps them heal up quicker
exabap-jk6e_6-5-rgb_front the colors the browns the blacks and the foamy are products and waste products from the liver and from the circulation and the oxidized waste and waste from the lymph
exabap-jk6e_7-5-rgb_front so as you will notice on the water you will see the waste
exabap-jk6e_8-5-rgb_front as the feet are in the water the feet almost become invisible underneath the shroud of the waste products
exabap-jk6e_9-5-rgb_front it is almost inconceivable that this much waste could be inside your body and you certainly would not drink it
exgujuehry0_0-5-rgb_front so make sure you have a large clean towel nearby
exgujuehry0_1-5-rgb_front after we shampoo and condition the hair we want to make sure that the towel is large enough that is it is going to be able to go under the hair totally cover her head so you can towel dry her hair
exgujuehry0_2-5-rgb_front if the towel is not large enough obviously you will not be catching all the moisture and you are going to have a mess everywhere
exgujuehry0_3-5-rgb_front a large enough towel something that you have specified for for hair color processing
exgujuehry0_4-5-rgb_front usually if you have colored your hair at home you have specific towels that you use
exgujuehry0_5-5-rgb_front but again a large enough towel to make sure that you will be able to cover your hair and do a wrap with your hair
exgujuehry0_6-5-rgb_front just make sure you have towel handy nearby for when the conditioner comes off
eyt03gnpayi_1-8-rgb_front basically all of them are powered by electric and they have an on and off switch and a foot pedal of course
eyt03gnpayi_10-8-rgb_front the other types of wheel there are is this is called the kick wheel and this is for obvious reasons
eyt03gnpayi_11-8-rgb_front this was one of my first wheels
eyt03gnpayi_12-8-rgb_front you sit down on it and you kick it as fast as you can
eyt03gnpayi_13-8-rgb_front i like this wheel because as you can see it has a half circle a little shelf here and i can get all my tools out around here
eyt03gnpayi_14-8-rgb_front it is easy to clean up it is stainless steel nothing rusts on it and as you can see the wheel goes around and around it will go around forever
eyt03gnpayi_15-8-rgb_front it has really nice ball bearings
eyt03gnpayi_16-8-rgb_front splash pans it has a really nice easy splash pan to take off and on
eyt03gnpayi_17-8-rgb_front danger part about these is that as the wheel is going down here where you kick it if you step on that it will throw you for a loop
eyt03gnpayi_18-8-rgb_front so there are dangers it is fun but there are dangers so you always want to stop your kick wheel before you get up and go
eyt03gnpayi_2-8-rgb_front one important thing about this is so you do not hurt yourself is it operates just like a car
eyt03gnpayi_3-8-rgb_front you press down to go the wheel head goes faster down to stop
eyt03gnpayi_4-8-rgb_front before you ever turn your wheel on you always want to make sure that your heel is down before you turn it on
eyt03gnpayi_5-8-rgb_front if it is not if you have it on and you have some things sitting on it and you turn it on a chair a bucket it will scare you
eyt03gnpayi_6-8-rgb_front plus you might hurt yourself
eyt03gnpayi_7-8-rgb_front so always make sure that the heel is down before you turn it on
eyt03gnpayi_8-8-rgb_front they all have an on and off switch
eyt03gnpayi_9-8-rgb_front now some potters wheel features if you are left handed the potters wheel actually goes clockwise okay
eyooi0oiewm_1-8-rgb_front well a lot of people say this is an intermediate technique i kind of think it is why putting it here
eyooi0oiewm_2-8-rgb_front this is how going to start doing some of the more detailed one balloon stuff and this is a pinch twist as a valuable tool for adding like sort of angles on balloons
eyooi0oiewm_3-8-rgb_front going to show you how to do it basically what a pinch twist is a really really small loop or fold twist so you would take a bubble and you want to pinch it like this and twist the base of it together like that so it really makes like tiny little loop twist or fold twist you can add these together and that would make you like a different style of animal ears like you can put that on a cat these are the ears that i put on a stegosaurus sometimes and if working with the balloon and you want to put an angle in it you can make a small bubble and put a pinch twist on it and that kind of gives it an angle
eyooi0oiewm_4-8-rgb_front so if sometimes if making a character and you want to give it like an elbow or a knee this is a pinch twist and how you do it so going to do more with this later a very valuable tool something you should learn is a pinch twist
eywnptrnsww_0-8-rgb_front hi i am laura pace i am here at asel art supply today i am going to give you a lesson on how to draw hair with a pencil
eywnptrnsww_1-8-rgb_front i used a pretty soft pencil to do this drawing
eywnptrnsww_10-8-rgb_front you will also notice that i left a line right here to show the part in her hair where you can see her very light colored skin in contrast to her dark hair
eywnptrnsww_11-8-rgb_front and then the last thing i did is i left some individual hairs showing on the ends of her hair some detail to give you an idea of the texture of her hair
eywnptrnsww_12-8-rgb_front next i drew a girl with very light colored hair so when you are drawing with blond or white hair you might even want to draw a shadow shape behind or around the head to give the edge of the hair some definition
eywnptrnsww_13-8-rgb_front we are going to kind of do the opposite of what we did on this girl with the dark hair here because the line work on this hair is in the shadow areas
eywnptrnsww_14-8-rgb_front she has kind of wavy hair so i went in and drew some individual parallel lines in the areas where there is shadows on her hair
eywnptrnsww_15-8-rgb_front and i also drew some shadows around her face so that you can see that the mass of her hair is casting a shadow on to the edge of her face
eywnptrnsww_16-8-rgb_front the darker shadows in this hair are going to be on these rounded shapes at the bottom
eywnptrnsww_17-8-rgb_front because they are receiving the least light from overhead
eywnptrnsww_18-8-rgb_front the third drawing of hair is for a person with kinky hair hair that is finely textured but very coarsely curled
eywnptrnsww_19-8-rgb_front you can see on here like this you do not get a lot of contrast between light and dark
eywnptrnsww_2-8-rgb_front this is a three b which makes a really soft black line
eywnptrnsww_20-8-rgb_front so i drew in a mass area of very dark that is just kind of a shape
eywnptrnsww_21-8-rgb_front it does not have a lot of detail to it
eywnptrnsww_22-8-rgb_front and you can also see that there is a cast shadow here around his forehead where the edge of his hair kind of makes a change in direction
eywnptrnsww_23-8-rgb_front on the top of the hair where the light hits there is a little suggestion of texture here which i did by making spiral lines with my pencil and the outside edge of this hair have a tiny detail of rounded lines
eywnptrnsww_24-8-rgb_front instead of just being a straight line i wanted to show the kinky texture of his hair by drawing rounded lines
eywnptrnsww_25-8-rgb_front so that is what i have to tell you about drawing hair
eywnptrnsww_26-8-rgb_front i suggest you get some photographs and look at people in make observations
eywnptrnsww_27-8-rgb_front practice drawing hair then you will get good at it
eywnptrnsww_3-8-rgb_front first thing we need to talk about when drawing hair is you need to have an idea of the shape of the skull
eywnptrnsww_4-8-rgb_front depending on how the person is face is turned because the hair really wraps around the skull
eywnptrnsww_5-8-rgb_front we want to draw the hair as masses of form rather then trying to draw individual hair
eywnptrnsww_6-8-rgb_front individual hair drawing is pretty tedious and it really does not give you a good idea of what you are seeing when you look at a person is hair
eywnptrnsww_7-8-rgb_front so the first drawing i did here is a girl with very dark hair
eywnptrnsww_8-8-rgb_front and i have some mass areas that i made here that i just completely blacked in with my dark pencil
eywnptrnsww_9-8-rgb_front but you can also see i left some highlight light areas to show that she has kind of a sheen to her very dark straight hair
ezampqelfrw_0-4-rgb_front hi my name is rachel and i am the owner of a austinstylewatch com street fashion site and i am also a freelance reporter
ezampqelfrw_1-4-rgb_front today we are going to talk about how to tell real leather from fake leather
ezampqelfrw_10-4-rgb_front with a fake leather it is more like a printed pattern and you are not going to see any pores and you are not going to see any of the natural leather imperfections you are just going to sort of see a perfect pattern
ezampqelfrw_11-4-rgb_front the next step we are going to look at is if there is any cut edges
ezampqelfrw_12-4-rgb_front on leather it should be rough on fake leather it should be a very clean cut
ezampqelfrw_13-4-rgb_front so this is fake this is real
ezampqelfrw_14-4-rgb_front so on this we can kind of look on the inside of this boot right up here around the corner where it is not exactly very neat it is kind of got wrinkles and roughness it is not a totally clean cut it is leather it is piecey a little bit
ezampqelfrw_15-4-rgb_front things like this boot the leather cuts are really just as clean as if they were plastic and that is how you can tell not real leather
ezampqelfrw_16-4-rgb_front so this has been how you can tell the real leather from the fake leather
ezampqelfrw_2-4-rgb_front so the first tip we are going to do and this seems really easy and it is actually not always possible but just look at the label see if it says leather
ezampqelfrw_3-4-rgb_front for things like boots a lot of times you will find it right here on the sole
ezampqelfrw_4-4-rgb_front for newer boots you will find it inside usually on a tag sometimes like that one or you might also find it on the bottom on a sole
ezampqelfrw_5-4-rgb_front so if it does not say leather on it percent leather sometimes it might say leather uppers which would mean the top is leather not the sole that way you will know it is leather
ezampqelfrw_6-4-rgb_front so these are both vintage these are old they do not have those labels anymore so let is take the next step
ezampqelfrw_7-4-rgb_front now this one kind of grosses me out a little bit but it is a great way to tell whether it is really leather or not and that is take a really close look a the skin and looks for pores
ezampqelfrw_8-4-rgb_front and these are just like the pores that you see in our skin the little holes that are in your skin that let it breathe just like us cows and all the other animals you might make leather out of have pores in their skin
ezampqelfrw_9-4-rgb_front so if you look really closely at the leather you should see just kind of natural imperfections of pores wrinkles things that have happened in the tanning process
e_s9g_nklvy_0-8-rgb_front hi on behalf of expert villlage com i am shelly here at aa callister in salt lake city utah
e_s9g_nklvy_1-8-rgb_front today we are talking about how to purchase a winter horse blanket
e_s9g_nklvy_10-8-rgb_front now you are going to need more insulation if you have a colder barn or if your horse is turned out and less insulation if you horse is in a warm barn
e_s9g_nklvy_11-8-rgb_front or maybe if your horse has been body clipped you are going to need something that has more insulation value
e_s9g_nklvy_12-8-rgb_front whereas if you do not care if he has a longer coat you can have something with less insulation value
e_s9g_nklvy_13-8-rgb_front also you are want to keep that mind when you are choosing a blanket because a blanket in the spring and the fall does not need to have quite as much insulation as one you are going to use in the winter because that is what s going to keep your horse warm
e_s9g_nklvy_14-8-rgb_front that is what s in the middle of the blanket
e_s9g_nklvy_15-8-rgb_front so the insulation value is what you are going to want to consider when you choose a winter horse blanket
e_s9g_nklvy_2-8-rgb_front one of the things you want to consider on a winter horse blanket is the insulation value
e_s9g_nklvy_3-8-rgb_front each blanket is going to have its own insulation value and that s what keeps the horse warm
e_s9g_nklvy_4-8-rgb_front so you are going to choose something that is measured in ounces or grams
e_s9g_nklvy_5-8-rgb_front it will state on the blanket what it is
e_s9g_nklvy_6-8-rgb_front so many ounces or so many grams
e_s9g_nklvy_7-8-rgb_front say for instance ounces is about equivalent to grams of insulation
e_s9g_nklvy_8-8-rgb_front just so you have something to compare against
e_s9g_nklvy_9-8-rgb_front that is what s going to keep your horse warm
ebl8txlxops_0-8-rgb_front hi i am greg lawrence with lake lessons and i am here to show you how to jump on a wakeboard
ebl8txlxops_1-8-rgb_front first of all there is several concepts you need to understand
ebl8txlxops_10-8-rgb_front as you get better with that one wake jump you are going to want to add more and more edge
ebl8txlxops_11-8-rgb_front now that is an important point
ebl8txlxops_12-8-rgb_front as you will see here ross is using a progressive edge as he edges into the wake
ebl8txlxops_13-8-rgb_front that progressive edge means he starts very easy at the beginning and he continues to add edge so that he is on his most aggressive edge as he goes up through the top of the wake harnessing all the power of the water rushing underneath the board at twenty plus miles an hour
ebl8txlxops_14-8-rgb_front i am greg lawrence and that is how you jump on a wakeboard
ebl8txlxops_2-8-rgb_front when jumping a wakeboard it is not done mostly by bending your legs and jumping as you would a jump shot
ebl8txlxops_3-8-rgb_front it is actually done by the edge of the board
ebl8txlxops_4-8-rgb_front you want to use the edge of your board for your power all the way up the wake and then while slightly pulling the handle in off the top of the wake to keep your momentum going forward with the boat
ebl8txlxops_5-8-rgb_front you want to extend your legs slightly for pressure so it is not like a jump shot in which you would push down with your toes
ebl8txlxops_6-8-rgb_front in fact you want to push with your heels only
ebl8txlxops_7-8-rgb_front in the air you want to remain as calm as possible and you want to land while crushing your knees just like there
ebl8txlxops_8-8-rgb_front now when you are first starting to learn how to do a jump you only want to take a small cut outside the wake and do a small controlled cut all the way up through the wake a one wake jump
ebl8txlxops_9-8-rgb_front this is going to get you used to not only releasing from the wake correctly but also landing and cushioning your landing
ecerzcfj7xg_0-8-rgb_front in this clip not only are we going to add fancy foot work but we are going to show what we do with our hands at the same time
ecerzcfj7xg_1-8-rgb_front it requires coordination
ecerzcfj7xg_10-8-rgb_front one two three it is a fist
ecerzcfj7xg_11-8-rgb_front one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three
ecerzcfj7xg_2-8-rgb_front it takes time with african dance
ecerzcfj7xg_3-8-rgb_front if you do not get it automatically that is okay
ecerzcfj7xg_4-8-rgb_front it is not something that just happens over night
ecerzcfj7xg_5-8-rgb_front it takes a lot of practice and years of instruction abd just sticking with it
ecerzcfj7xg_6-8-rgb_front so the last clip two three one two three
ecerzcfj7xg_7-8-rgb_front so we are going to go up
ecerzcfj7xg_8-8-rgb_front when we lift on our left foot one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three
ecerzcfj7xg_9-8-rgb_front one two three lift one two three lift your hands
edhg6fflhtg_0-8-rgb_front the next thing i am going to show you is called a step touch
edhg6fflhtg_1-8-rgb_front you can do the step touch to the front to the side and to the back
edhg6fflhtg_10-8-rgb_front step touch
edhg6fflhtg_11-8-rgb_front step touch
edhg6fflhtg_12-8-rgb_front step touch this is step touch forward and to forward
edhg6fflhtg_13-8-rgb_front forward forward forward forward and next we are going step touch the side
edhg6fflhtg_14-8-rgb_front so just step touch and when we put our foot down you just want to put a little pressure in to it so step touch step touch step touch step touch this is step touch to the side and now we are going to bring it back
edhg6fflhtg_15-8-rgb_front back with the left leg and we touch we are just going to put a little pressure into the foot and down
edhg6fflhtg_16-8-rgb_front step back pressure into the foot and back and bring it back touch touch touch bring it forward touch touch touch touch out to the side touch touch touch touch and back
edhg6fflhtg_17-8-rgb_front three four five six seven and eight step touch
edhg6fflhtg_2-8-rgb_front we are going to start in the front
edhg6fflhtg_3-8-rgb_front make sure you are in good posture
edhg6fflhtg_4-8-rgb_front what you want to do is make sure your knees are bent
edhg6fflhtg_5-8-rgb_front chest is lifted we are going to bring one foot forward and touch
edhg6fflhtg_6-8-rgb_front when you touch just put a little weight into it
edhg6fflhtg_7-8-rgb_front step touch put a little weight into it and your hips going to come forward
edhg6fflhtg_8-8-rgb_front so again when you come forward step touch
edhg6fflhtg_9-8-rgb_front just put a little weight into it when you touch
eefsk97g-44_0-5-rgb_front so in order to cut your string or wire you are going to need cutting utensils
eefsk97g-44_1-5-rgb_front with stretchy cord you can use scissors or wire cutters
eefsk97g-44_10-5-rgb_front they are too delicate
eefsk97g-44_11-5-rgb_front so you want to get a more wire cutter because it is a lot thicker
eefsk97g-44_2-5-rgb_front and you can get all these at the hardware store by the way or bead shop anything like that
eefsk97g-44_3-5-rgb_front the tiger tail do not use scissors
eefsk97g-44_4-5-rgb_front you will ruin your scissors
eefsk97g-44_5-5-rgb_front and you can use any of these type of wire cutters for tiger tail
eefsk97g-44_6-5-rgb_front it is very easy to cut with wire cutters
eefsk97g-44_7-5-rgb_front do not use scissors
eefsk97g-44_8-5-rgb_front with memory wire it is way thicker
eefsk97g-44_9-5-rgb_front so you do not want to use really delicate wire cutters because you will put little nicks in them
eflyfji9evq_1-8-rgb_front we have already spoke about contacting the insurance company the insurance company is going go send you whatever you pay for that sit
eflyfji9evq_2-8-rgb_front you can get the same sit if the baby would still fit that sit or the child fits that sit if now you can use the money to buy the next sit up
eflyfji9evq_3-8-rgb_front the important thing is to make sure that this sit is not reused and doing that we want you to cut out the hardness straps
eflyfji9evq_4-8-rgb_front if your getting the same sit you like the fabric you can reuse the fabric but please destroy the hardness straps try to destroy the sit as best as possible and we also ask that you get a sharpie and mark the sit in crash do not use
eflyfji9evq_5-8-rgb_front cause unfortunately these sits are fished out of trash and reused all the time
egeqroljkxc_0-8-rgb_front now in this segment we are going to learn what the zoom control is what the focus control is and how to use them both
egeqroljkxc_1-8-rgb_front now the zoom control is right over here
egeqroljkxc_10-8-rgb_front now if you go to the left it moves it out just like with the zoom
egeqroljkxc_11-8-rgb_front if you go to the right it moves it in
egeqroljkxc_12-8-rgb_front and once you have perfect focus which really you have to look at with your eye there is no button or sensor saying that is focused
egeqroljkxc_13-8-rgb_front you have to look at it with your eye and you can tell because it is going to be a really sharp image
egeqroljkxc_14-8-rgb_front then from there you zoom out and you set your shot and then you get ready to go
egeqroljkxc_15-8-rgb_front now you always want to make sure you focus on a subjects eyes if you are doing a human
egeqroljkxc_16-8-rgb_front that way because obviously the face is going to the subject of the shot that way you have absolute focus on there
egeqroljkxc_17-8-rgb_front now there are some guys out there that may want to focus on other parts of the body but that is not the correct way to do it
egeqroljkxc_2-8-rgb_front all it is really is a not really a trigger but if you have every played with a remote control cars with the little wheel on it to steer them that is kind of how it is
egeqroljkxc_3-8-rgb_front you want to take it like this it does have nice little grooves for your fingers to go in and you always want to use your thumb while controlling it
egeqroljkxc_4-8-rgb_front that way it is you do have a little more control with your thumb than you can think of
egeqroljkxc_5-8-rgb_front now to zoom in you push to the right hand side
egeqroljkxc_6-8-rgb_front to zoom out you push to the left hand side
egeqroljkxc_7-8-rgb_front now when you are zooming you always want to make it smooth if it is on air if it is not go right ahead and zoom in fast zoom out fast which ever you want to do
egeqroljkxc_8-8-rgb_front and then with your focus what you want to do to get proper focus on a subject is you want to zoom in all the way to that subject and with your focus you want to either take your focus inward or outward
egeqroljkxc_9-8-rgb_front which is actually moving the lens inside inward or outward
ehqk9k4el_k_0-8-rgb_front hi my name is keith fitzpatrick with hip hop for kids and we are going to go over break it down
ehqk9k4el_k_1-8-rgb_front so a really easy step and this is another little toe step like we have been doing with some of the other ones but with this one you are going to have a little bit more bounce in your upper body
ehqk9k4el_k_2-8-rgb_front so with this one you are going to start forward you will come forward you bring your foot up you bring it down then you will bring this one up and you will bring it down so you will come boom here boom here boom here
ehqk9k4el_k_3-8-rgb_front so again you are here boom here boom here boom here boom up
ehqk9k4el_k_4-8-rgb_front so as opposed to the other ones when you were doing this but with this you are using upper body you are bouncing that way you want to bounce boom up boom here boom here so with that last one you can turn up and you want to turn your body this way and start over again or you can bring your body this way and change your direction so you can just go here up down up here up down up change boom boom here boom here down up and then you can just come back that way and change the direction but every time you are doing it you want to really look like you are breaking it down and that is your break it down
evypwgueaci_0-8-rgb_front you are at a restaurant you have just finished eating dinner the bill arrives you reach for your wallet and your credit cards are missing
evypwgueaci_1-8-rgb_front hello i am robert todd and i am here to answer the question how do i report the loss of credit cards and fraud
evypwgueaci_2-8-rgb_front well first thing you want to do is you want to be sure and notify immediately the issuer of each credit card
evypwgueaci_3-8-rgb_front generally this information was provided you when you were sent the credit card
evypwgueaci_4-8-rgb_front it is not usually on the credit card it would not do any much good if it was if you are missing the credit card
evypwgueaci_5-8-rgb_front so it is probably advisable when you are issued a credit card to put in a safe place the identity of the issuer of the credit cards that you have that available if and when your credit card show up missing
evypwgueaci_6-8-rgb_front the next thing you want to do is if you suspect fraud is to notify the federal trade commission or the ftc
evypwgueaci_7_8_9-8-rgb_front they have a website at www ftc gov and a toll free no i am robert todd and thank your for watching
ewtrumg6x3g_0-8-rgb_front there are many different variations of snake arms
ewtrumg6x3g_1-8-rgb_front they go from absolutely large huge slow snake arms to a little bit smaller
ewtrumg6x3g_10-8-rgb_front now the beautiful part of this move is in the transition from here to here
ewtrumg6x3g_11-8-rgb_front so you want to make sure your elbow is coming up and then you re rolling down here
ewtrumg6x3g_12-8-rgb_front now watch the hand make sure the hand does not fly around
ewtrumg6x3g_13-8-rgb_front our palm is facing in and then the palm is facing out as if your brush your fingertips along the wall
ewtrumg6x3g_14-8-rgb_front up and down and you want to drill with both arms
ewtrumg6x3g_15-8-rgb_front up and down again elbow wrist elbow wrist
ewtrumg6x3g_16-8-rgb_front elbow wrist when you add both arms together that is the tricky part
ewtrumg6x3g_17-8-rgb_front so you want to drill each arm separately before adding them together
ewtrumg6x3g_18-8-rgb_front one two switch three
ewtrumg6x3g_19-8-rgb_front practice in front of a mirror so you can really watch yourself and make sure your doing them correctly
ewtrumg6x3g_2-8-rgb_front we are going to go over a low snake arm
ewtrumg6x3g_3-8-rgb_front sometimes the upper movements will hurt your shoulder so you want to make sure that you are not bothering your shoulder in this movement
ewtrumg6x3g_4-8-rgb_front you can also refer to our arm drills to help to train your body for this movement as well
ewtrumg6x3g_5-8-rgb_front so we are going to start with our elbow
ewtrumg6x3g_6-8-rgb_front the elbow is going to lift up and the wrist is going to lift up
ewtrumg6x3g_7-8-rgb_front then the elbow is going to drop
ewtrumg6x3g_8-8-rgb_front then the wrist is going to drop
ewtrumg6x3g_9-8-rgb_front the elbow is going to go up wrist up elbow drop wrist drop
ewuquklarsa_0-2-rgb_front hi this is jon and in this clip we will be installing our door sweep
ewuquklarsa_1-2-rgb_front if we take a look at the very bottom of our door we have a fairly significant gap where wind and air or even bugs could get in
ewuquklarsa_2-2-rgb_front to remedy this our door has come with a sweep and a rubber gasket for that sweep so that we can form a nice tight seal on the bottom so no air or bugs or anything can get in
ewuquklarsa_3-2-rgb_front the first thing we need to do is feed our rubber gasket into the channel on our door sweep and we are just going to fit it all the way down
ewuquklarsa_4-2-rgb_front then we are just going to trim off the extra
ewuquklarsa_5-2-rgb_front after that we are just going to take our door sweep and our door and we are just going to snap that in place at the bottom
ewuquklarsa_6-2-rgb_front now our door sweep does adjust up and down depending on how much gap you need to fill
ewuquklarsa_7-2-rgb_front so what you need to do is close your door and set your gap correctly and then put in your screws
ewuquklarsa_8-2-rgb_front and of course when you are done you will want to double check the fit of your door sweep
exmbwktwuls_0-5-rgb_front the next step we have here is to find a bucket
exmbwktwuls_1-5-rgb_front this is a professional window washing bucket
exmbwktwuls_2-5-rgb_front it works great because you can have a long sponge and stick it in there without having a whole lot of water in the bucket
exmbwktwuls_3-5-rgb_front that is why they are elongated like that
exmbwktwuls_4-5-rgb_front second if you are just doing this around the house and you want something to use i just got this from home depot any old bucket will do
exmbwktwuls_5-5-rgb_front the problem you find with some of these buckets if you are trying to get your sponge wet sometimes you have to stick it in one side and dip it in the other and that is why these other buckets are handy
exmbwktwuls_6-5-rgb_front and this bucket i have is what i keep my equipment in
exmbwktwuls_7-5-rgb_front you an pick this up at a cleaning supply store for to
exmbwktwuls_8-5-rgb_front it has a spot for your sponge and a spot for your squeegee and you can put two or three different size squeegees in there
exmbwktwuls_9-5-rgb_front if you are going to be doing this full time professionally you definitely want to invest in something like this
exor8fu9q4m_0_1_2-8-rgb_front alright welcome back i am bobby larew your expert on diving we are in the hurdle phase of our front approach ok we have done the approach now we are in the hurdle phase
exor8fu9q4m_10-8-rgb_front my back leg ok it is a little tricky is going to come up in to a degree position ok or a backwards l ok
exor8fu9q4m_11-8-rgb_front so in my hurdle my right leg which is my take off leg is pushing in to the board getting ready to jump
exor8fu9q4m_12-8-rgb_front my left leg is coming up to a degree angle ok
exor8fu9q4m_13-8-rgb_front remember my foot is tucked against my other knee alright
exor8fu9q4m_14-8-rgb_front now if you are take off leg is your left leg i will do it on the other side so you do not get confused ok my left leg is take off
exor8fu9q4m_15-8-rgb_front my left leg and my feet are pushing in to board to get power to make the board bend
exor8fu9q4m_16-8-rgb_front my right leg is going to come up still a degree angle
exor8fu9q4m_17-8-rgb_front it is going to look like an l ok
exor8fu9q4m_18-8-rgb_front remember you are right foot now is tucked in to your left knee
exor8fu9q4m_19-8-rgb_front that is what happens on your legs in the hurdle part of diving
exor8fu9q4m_3-8-rgb_front here is what we just talked about pointing the feet ant the toes
exor8fu9q4m_4-8-rgb_front now we will talk about your legs
exor8fu9q4m_5-8-rgb_front this is a really tricky part ok
exor8fu9q4m_6-8-rgb_front so i want to walk through both legs
exor8fu9q4m_7-8-rgb_front remember my take off leg is my right leg
exor8fu9q4m_8-8-rgb_front so when i am in my last step my fifth step i am going to put my weight on to this leg because the more weight and power and push i get on this leg the farther the board will go down ok
exor8fu9q4m_9-8-rgb_front so i am pushing the board down with this leg
ey9k0gwyksi_0-8-rgb_front the next brush we are going to discuss is a powder brush
ey9k0gwyksi_1-8-rgb_front i am going to use loose powder today so i have this loose powder brush
ey9k0gwyksi_10-8-rgb_front again tap work up toward the hair line
ey9k0gwyksi_11-8-rgb_front you always want to work your way toward the hair line
ey9k0gwyksi_12-8-rgb_front this is a translucent powder so it is going to give a really light finish and you do not necessarily have to be perfect with it
ey9k0gwyksi_13-8-rgb_front i know this is a unique brush
ey9k0gwyksi_14-8-rgb_front everyone might have something closer to this at their house
ey9k0gwyksi_15-8-rgb_front you would use it the same way
ey9k0gwyksi_16-8-rgb_front just swirl it in the powder
ey9k0gwyksi_17-8-rgb_front you might have to tap it off a little bit because you can see how it gets deposits of more powder whereas this one gets an equal share of powder through the whole brush
ey9k0gwyksi_2-8-rgb_front i call this my don king brush
ey9k0gwyksi_3-8-rgb_front it is very soft and it is a combination of synthetic and natural hair
ey9k0gwyksi_4-8-rgb_front this is a great brush for powder because it keeps everything loose without giving it a cakey feel
ey9k0gwyksi_5-8-rgb_front like i said i am using a loose powder today so i want to start by taking some of the powder and pouring it into the cap
ey9k0gwyksi_6-8-rgb_front that is good
ey9k0gwyksi_7-8-rgb_front i am going to lightly tap the brush into the powder
ey9k0gwyksi_8-8-rgb_front tap off some of the excess and just lightly go over the entire face
ey9k0gwyksi_9-8-rgb_front under the eye where we just concealed working my way down and out
eyrb0khju3i_0-5-rgb_front i would like to show you a couple of examples real quick of a good corner and a bad corner
eyrb0khju3i_1-5-rgb_front a good corner would be when the two edges meet and they line up and they are nice and straight and flush
eyrb0khju3i_10-5-rgb_front it is kind of like screwing your screw in too far
eyrb0khju3i_11-5-rgb_front we really try to avoid that and we try and get all our corners perfect but once in a while when one does happen if we can still make it look perfect and it will work out then sometimes we just go ahead with it
eyrb0khju3i_2-5-rgb_front this right here would be an example of a good corner
eyrb0khju3i_3-5-rgb_front now i am going to demonstrate to you what a bad corner would look like
eyrb0khju3i_4-5-rgb_front this right here would be a bad corner and the reason it would be a bad corner is because both drywalls from both sides of here do not meet up straight inside here and since it did that there is no meat for this to grab on to right here and it just makes it harder for it to set in place
eyrb0khju3i_5-5-rgb_front now as long as it is straight which is it when we installed it we made sure that the corner bead did go on straight
eyrb0khju3i_6-5-rgb_front it is still alright
eyrb0khju3i_7-5-rgb_front although it would be better if the drywall ran underneath this
eyrb0khju3i_8-5-rgb_front now the reason this happened is probably a sheet was cut and put into place and it was just accidentally cut wrong which happens
eyrb0khju3i_9-5-rgb_front so we try to avoid that
ez2bcezmtgc_1-5-rgb_front today we are going to talk about the interview process
ez2bcezmtgc_10-5-rgb_front if you are going in for an interview make that interviewer the most important person at that time
ez2bcezmtgc_11-5-rgb_front the best way to do that is to leave your cell phone in your car that is in the parking lot because there is nothing as important as that interview when you are there
ez2bcezmtgc_12-5-rgb_front nothing
ez2bcezmtgc_13-5-rgb_front you can always get voicemail
ez2bcezmtgc_14-5-rgb_front that is why they have them
ez2bcezmtgc_15-5-rgb_front turn your phone off leave it in your car
ez2bcezmtgc_16-5-rgb_front when you go in be focused and ready to go for the interview
ez2bcezmtgc_2-5-rgb_front the other thing that you need to think about when you are into the interview process is your cell phone
ez2bcezmtgc_3-5-rgb_front today so many of us have got cell phones and they are part of our hip
ez2bcezmtgc_4-5-rgb_front they are in our pockets they are in our purses
ez2bcezmtgc_5-5-rgb_front they are everywhere in our life
ez2bcezmtgc_6-5-rgb_front we use them all the time
ez2bcezmtgc_7-5-rgb_front they are ringing they are buzzing they are going off at all times
ez2bcezmtgc_8-5-rgb_front kiss of death in an interview is that if you care enough to turn your phone i probably do not care enough to hire you
ez2bcezmtgc_9-5-rgb_front my thinking is and has always been and the people that i have discussed this with have always said the same thing
ez9_he04234_0-8-rgb_front so this super complicated dial knob over hear
ez9_he04234_1-8-rgb_front so the way to break this one down so you have got normal you have got permanent press you have got short and you have got prewash and then you have got all this other regular what not
ez9_he04234_10-8-rgb_front and then you pop it on and it is going to go through it is whole cycle and will take like probably a half hour whatever
ez9_he04234_11-8-rgb_front and then it goes through like it fills up with the water and then it rinses it and then it spins and gets all the water out and then it gets to the off
ez9_he04234_12-8-rgb_front then from there like permanent press short and i honestly do not use that much
ez9_he04234_13-8-rgb_front so if you want to know about those you are going to have to call the whirlpool association
ez9_he04234_2-8-rgb_front basically the only one i have ever used in my life is the normal one over here
ez9_he04234_3-8-rgb_front because it is normal and i am normal i guess
ez9_he04234_4-8-rgb_front you have got and what is cook about the normal is it breaks it down super simple
ez9_he04234_5-8-rgb_front because normal one is like alright so we take this knob and i turn it over to i find my normal i have got am heavy
ez9_he04234_6-8-rgb_front am i regular
ez9_he04234_7-8-rgb_front or am it is just like fourteen ten or six
ez9_he04234_8-8-rgb_front so heavy regular and whatnot
ez9_he04234_9-8-rgb_front and what is great about normal is you just go well i do not really care so i am going to go normal regular
ezkicyy-hky_0-2-rgb_front hi my name is lauren and today i am going to discuss hair drying tips
ezkicyy-hky_1-2-rgb_front after you get out of the shower you are and you wring out most of the moisture from your hair you are going to take your damp hair you are going to place a little product in it
ezkicyy-hky_10-2-rgb_front you are going to do this all throughout your entire head in order to promote volume and get the shape that you want on your hair
ezkicyy-hky_11-2-rgb_front once your hair is about eighty percent dry that is when it will really start taking shape
ezkicyy-hky_12-2-rgb_front i recommend maybe use a clip
ezkicyy-hky_13-2-rgb_front clip the hair section some of the others out of the way
ezkicyy-hky_14-2-rgb_front get a round brush if that you want to tri curl it under
ezkicyy-hky_15-2-rgb_front it can either be it should be ceramic based in order to kind of heat up the ceramic
ezkicyy-hky_16-2-rgb_front you are going to roll it in almost as if it was a curler
ezkicyy-hky_17-2-rgb_front you are going to heat up the ceramic with the hot air and then you are going to use the cool button
ezkicyy-hky_18-2-rgb_front the cool button is going to set in the style that you are looking to have
ezkicyy-hky_19-2-rgb_front so if you were looking to roll it under it will actually help your hair stay there
ezkicyy-hky_2-2-rgb_front emulsify the product really well within your hands go through the ends of your hair first and then work your way towards the root in order to prevent putting too much product and give giving your hair more of a greasier look
ezkicyy-hky_20-2-rgb_front so you are just going to pull your hair out
ezkicyy-hky_21-2-rgb_front release the brush when it is done and it should bevel under
ezkicyy-hky_22-2-rgb_front you will do this for the rest of your hair
ezkicyy-hky_23-2-rgb_front as long as you dry about eighty percent beforehand you will be fine and it will cut down on your drying time and it will make it a lot quicker and a lot more effective
ezkicyy-hky_24-2-rgb_front and that is tips on drying your hair
ezkicyy-hky_3-2-rgb_front if you are in trying to keep volume what you are going to do is put a root lifter if you have one and then you can just spray that
ezkicyy-hky_4-2-rgb_front that is the only product that will goes essentially only by the root
ezkicyy-hky_5-2-rgb_front once you have done and placed your product in you are actually going to lift your hair and direct your hair to where you want it to go
ezkicyy-hky_6-2-rgb_front your hair because of your own natural body heat will dry by the root quicker
ezkicyy-hky_7-2-rgb_front so rather than section it when it is very wet and getting starting from the bottom and working your way up you are not going to achieve the volume that you may want on the top
ezkicyy-hky_8-2-rgb_front you are going to lift your hair in smaller sections using your hands
ezkicyy-hky_9-2-rgb_front focus your blow dryer onto your root and work your way onto your root and work your way up from your root to your
ezvp_trd6o8_10-5-rgb_front leave your fingers on the inside of the tape and pull it snug but you are going to have a little bit of a gap because of the fingers in there
ezvp_trd6o8_11-5-rgb_front you really want the shirt to be about an inch bigger than what your neck is so that you will be comfortable
ezvp_trd6o8_12-5-rgb_front the third option would be just to find a dress shirt in the closet that fits nice usually in the back of the neck will have the size of the shirt and in those cases just write down whatever that shirt size is and work fine
ezvp_trd6o8_13-5-rgb_front so three ways all of them should work fine if you take your time and do it right but leave a little bit of a gap
ezvp_trd6o8_2-5-rgb_front right now we are going to show you the proper way to measure for a neck measurement on for your shirt
ezvp_trd6o8_3-5-rgb_front last thing you want is a tight shirt that is going to make you choke all night
ezvp_trd6o8_4-5-rgb_front you are going to be uncomfortable already so we want you to be as comfortable as possible
ezvp_trd6o8_5-5-rgb_front there are three basic shirt types there are collars and there is the lay down collar mandarin collar
ezvp_trd6o8_6-5-rgb_front same thing is in common with all of them though they all take the same type of measuring to determine the neck size
ezvp_trd6o8_7-5-rgb_front so you do that is you go right around the neck above the shirt there is actually about three way you can do this but pull it tight and then whatever measurement you get add an inch to that
ezvp_trd6o8_8-5-rgb_front and that is how i do it most of the time
ezvp_trd6o8_9-5-rgb_front but there is another way to do it is you can go around the neck
f1r7mzsloog_1-5-rgb_front i just wanted to show you quickly about this black bean
f1r7mzsloog_10-5-rgb_front it is a great dinner for tonight
f1r7mzsloog_11-5-rgb_front thank you so much
f1r7mzsloog_2-5-rgb_front this is a hard black bean it has not been cooked it is really quiet small compared to the pinto bean
f1r7mzsloog_3-5-rgb_front that is one of the reasons why it cooks so quickly is that it is much much smaller
f1r7mzsloog_4-5-rgb_front today we are cooking this black bean in a pressure cooker
f1r7mzsloog_5-5-rgb_front i have just done a quick soak with it
f1r7mzsloog_6-5-rgb_front we have emptied all the water out and put the bean that we just cooked for minutes and we went ahead and put it back in the pressure cooker with cups of water
f1r7mzsloog_7-5-rgb_front we are going to go ahead and bring it up to pounds of pressure cook it for about minutes
f1r7mzsloog_8-5-rgb_front just let it sit there on the stove without the burner on or anything for about minutes
f1r7mzsloog_9-5-rgb_front these would be done and i really hope that you would be motivated to run out and make some black bean salsa it so good
f1tmeqbc7wy_0-5-rgb_front today we are going to talk a little about iron stone i just want to give a overview about iron stone you will find many pieces from the century and the century
f1tmeqbc7wy_1-5-rgb_front this is very typical iron stone piece right here is just a blank white iron stone it comes in a you will find it they use this type of iron stone in century and we have talked a little bit about in different series
f1tmeqbc7wy_2-5-rgb_front about iron stone the base for iron stone in flow blue they used a typical base like this it is a heavy weight iron stone
f1tmeqbc7wy_3-5-rgb_front you will see it in flow blue in what we showed you in mulberry which is an iron stone base like this a heavy piece
f1tmeqbc7wy_4-5-rgb_front you will see it in a light blue which we also showed you in the series and most of the transfer ware you will find earlier in mid century is a heavy weight like this
f1tmeqbc7wy_5-5-rgb_front so this is what we are talking about here and i am going to show you a number of different examples not necessarily this plain white iron stone but different iron stones that are english and american
f3a9l7ygmem_1-3-rgb_front why do we practice
f3a9l7ygmem_12-3-rgb_front consistency is gripping it the same having good towards aiming it the same and making the same good parts of the swing
f3a9l7ygmem_13-3-rgb_front the good back swing and a good forward swing
f3a9l7ygmem_14-3-rgb_front you control the distance by how far you take your hands and the club back and how fast you swing your arms on a forward swing
f3a9l7ygmem_15-3-rgb_front one controls the arch the other one controls the club head speed
f3a9l7ygmem_16-3-rgb_front all you need is one consistent swing
f3a9l7ygmem_17-3-rgb_front does this sound simple
f3a9l7ygmem_18-3-rgb_front well let me tell you something it is simple
f3a9l7ygmem_19-3-rgb_front called the kiss method
f3a9l7ygmem_2-3-rgb_front why do we work on our game
f3a9l7ygmem_20-3-rgb_front keep it simple stupid
f3a9l7ygmem_21-3-rgb_front why
f3a9l7ygmem_22-3-rgb_front because the physical part of the game is not the hard part
f3a9l7ygmem_23-3-rgb_front golf is a brain game
f3a9l7ygmem_24-3-rgb_front you have to think the ball around the course
f3a9l7ygmem_25-3-rgb_front look at all the mini middle obstacles you have to overcome
f3a9l7ygmem_26-3-rgb_front imagine people watching you tee off on the first tee
f3a9l7ygmem_27-3-rgb_front now imagine tiger woods with about
f3a9l7ygmem_28-3-rgb_front imagine people watching you put a footer in the last hole to win the u s open
f3a9l7ygmem_29-3-rgb_front how about your buddies hoping you miss it so they lose all their money
f3a9l7ygmem_3-3-rgb_front why do we do all the things we do
f3a9l7ygmem_30-3-rgb_front that out of bounds to the right that lake to left those bunkers all mental obstacles
f3a9l7ygmem_31-3-rgb_front if you keep it simple develop one really good response
f3a9l7ygmem_32-3-rgb_front i promise you you can overcome those obstacles
f3a9l7ygmem_4-3-rgb_front well in essence what we want to do is create one consistent response
f3a9l7ygmem_5-3-rgb_front if we can learn to do one thing really well we get pretty good at it
f3a9l7ygmem_6-3-rgb_front in golf all you need is one good swing
f3a9l7ygmem_7-3-rgb_front it works on your putting your chipping your pitching and even your driver
f3a9l7ygmem_8-3-rgb_front in essence your hands and the clubs start it back your arms swing the club at your target
f3a9l7ygmem_9_10_11-3-rgb_front your hands and your clubs swing it back your arms swing the club at your target on a full swing the hands and club start it back and your arms swing the club at the target
f49dpjcnefq_0-5-rgb_front hi this is liz muller from liz hair design in hollywood florida
f49dpjcnefq_1-5-rgb_front in this clip i am going to show you how to make a pony tail
f49dpjcnefq_10-5-rgb_front you have got yourself a medium sized cute pony tail
f49dpjcnefq_11_12_13-5-rgb_front look how nice her hair is it is fluffy you see now that is me that is right in the middle it can go up here in the middle of the head it can go even lower than that ok business women wear theirs a little low sometimes all the way down here
f49dpjcnefq_14-5-rgb_front this is is liz muller and this is how to make a pony tail
f49dpjcnefq_2-5-rgb_front we have nice pretty hair here
f49dpjcnefq_3-5-rgb_front we are going to go ahead and brush it and make it nice and soft and easy to manage when we do the pony tail
f49dpjcnefq_4-5-rgb_front now depends on how you want to wear your pony tail
f49dpjcnefq_5-5-rgb_front if you want to wear the pony tail high you come up high like this and it is really great for the young people they usually love to wear their pony tail is high especially young girls high school girls and cheerleader is and all that stuff
f49dpjcnefq_6-5-rgb_front they usually wear the pony tail is real real high
f49dpjcnefq_7-5-rgb_front you want to take it and brush it make it neat
f49dpjcnefq_8-5-rgb_front this is actually in the middle of the head
f49dpjcnefq_9-5-rgb_front you can take it and put it in there like that little band for the hair
f6linkbu7io_1-8-rgb_front first of all new oil
f6linkbu7io_10-8-rgb_front first and foremost when you make biodiesel both will make biodiesel but new vegetable oil is always going to be easier to make
f6linkbu7io_11-8-rgb_front notice how much is get a shot of that how clear that is
f6linkbu7io_12-8-rgb_front this is waste vegetable oil
f6linkbu7io_13-8-rgb_front this is oil that came from a restaurant
f6linkbu7io_14-8-rgb_front kinda gross kinda nasty kinda smells like it
f6linkbu7io_15-8-rgb_front but we can still make biodiesel from it
f6linkbu7io_16-8-rgb_front however the gel point of the biodiesel made from the new oil is a little bit than biodiesel made from used oil
f6linkbu7io_17-8-rgb_front so you can make it from either one it depends on what your pocket book is like
f6linkbu7io_18-8-rgb_front i recommend you use vegetable oil
f6linkbu7io_2-8-rgb_front if i was to walk into and buy new oil such as canola or corn oil or different things there is one problem
f6linkbu7io_3-8-rgb_front it is really really really expensive
f6linkbu7io_4-8-rgb_front in fact for a gallon of canola oil we are running almost a gallon
f6linkbu7io_5-8-rgb_front i do not know about you but that is a little bit more than diesel fuel right now
f6linkbu7io_6-8-rgb_front however it makes great biodiesel and in fact most of the commercial biodiesel made in the united states today is made from new oil
f6linkbu7io_7-8-rgb_front used oil cheap cheap cheap
f6linkbu7io_8-8-rgb_front however you have got to go out and collect it instead of driving to the store and getting it
f6linkbu7io_9-8-rgb_front now i want to show you what the difference looks like
f6sje6s7fbq_0-8-rgb_front in this clip all we are doing is simply putting the kite away
f6sje6s7fbq_1-8-rgb_front we just went out on the water had a sick session great day
f6sje6s7fbq_10-8-rgb_front i will never put them away if they are sandy
f6sje6s7fbq_11-8-rgb_front and if they are wet when i get home i make sure i let them out to dry
f6sje6s7fbq_12-8-rgb_front really important is if your kite is wet with salt water it is not necessarily the worst thing in the world these kites are made to be wet obviously you use them in the water all the time but salt water actually does not mould
f6sje6s7fbq_13-8-rgb_front that is the big thing about it
f6sje6s7fbq_14-8-rgb_front so if it is wet with salt water you can put it away and that is alright
f6sje6s7fbq_15-8-rgb_front but if it rains on it or you are kiting somewhere in the great lakes or somewhere where it is just fresh water make sure when you put the kite away you are putting away a dry kite
f6sje6s7fbq_16-8-rgb_front because the next time you open your bag and pull out your kite all of a sudden you are going to find all this nasty mould wrapped around the entire thing
f6sje6s7fbq_17-8-rgb_front i reach forward grab my bar and i am going to sort of reel up this last little bit of excess line and then just you know anyway i can just kind of hitch it off tuck it through and make sure this excess sort of little ends right here
f6sje6s7fbq_2-8-rgb_front but basically we want to make sure that we are going to put this kite away in a fashion that is going to promote us going out and doing that again real nice and easy next time
f6sje6s7fbq_3-8-rgb_front so just to keep good bridle maintenance here and make sure nothing is getting too twisted i am going to detach these lines and i am going to reattach the bridles to each other
f6sje6s7fbq_4-8-rgb_front that way one bridle can not get intertwined within itself and i know everything is just going to be exactly the way i left it next time i pull this kite out
f6sje6s7fbq_5-8-rgb_front so i go ahead i detach those lines and just attach these two bridles just to each other like that
f6sje6s7fbq_6-8-rgb_front go over here to this other one do the same thing
f6sje6s7fbq_7-8-rgb_front and if you look at the kite you can see that this kite has a good amount of sand on it
f6sje6s7fbq_8-8-rgb_front i use my kite everyday it is windy and i need to make sure that these kites are always in proper working order
f6sje6s7fbq_9-8-rgb_front so in order to you know really assure that and make sure you know that it is absolutely up to par every time i need it to be i keep absolutely perfect care of my kites
f6rseb4gle8_1-8-rgb_front we saw how the plus sign works in our google search
f6rseb4gle8_10-8-rgb_front so therefore i am going to get a more specific search and a much more specific results to exactly what i am looking for
f6rseb4gle8_2-8-rgb_front now let is see how the minus sign works
f6rseb4gle8_3-8-rgb_front the minus sign will tell google not to include a particular search term in its search
f6rseb4gle8_4-8-rgb_front for instance this comes in handy let is say when we are doing a search for techincal information
f6rseb4gle8_5-8-rgb_front let is put in clean mini disk and we do a search that we end up getting a lot of results from merchants offering to sell us either some type of mini disks or cleaning kits and that is not what i am really looking for
f6rseb4gle8_6-8-rgb_front i am looking for technical information on how to actually clean the mini disk
f6rseb4gle8_7-8-rgb_front so what i want to do is in my search i am going to limit my search to just the words clean mini disk
f6rseb4gle8_8-8-rgb_front i am going to put a minus sign next to the word merchant
f6rseb4gle8_9-8-rgb_front now when google does the search it is going not look for any items any pages that have the word merchant it is not going to return those pages in my results
f8shd9ywefo_0-2-rgb_front if you own a windows computer i am sure at some point or another it is frozen up on you and you have to shut it off
f8shd9ywefo_1-2-rgb_front hi i am charles stewart jr and i am going to tell you what to do if your computer freezes up and you need to shut it off
f8shd9ywefo_10-2-rgb_front now if you hit the power button on the computer and still nothing happens that means the computer is really locked up and there is not much you can do from that point on other than to disconnect the power
f8shd9ywefo_11-2-rgb_front a lot of computers on the back will have a sort of like a breaker where you see the power cord beat plugged into the back of the computer
f8shd9ywefo_12-2-rgb_front basically you will reach back there and flip the button
f8shd9ywefo_13-2-rgb_front there should be an on and off switch
f8shd9ywefo_14-2-rgb_front flip that it is like flipping a breaker in your house
f8shd9ywefo_15-2-rgb_front it will shut off the computer
f8shd9ywefo_16-2-rgb_front granted it is not the best way to do it
f8shd9ywefo_17-2-rgb_front it is not good to shut your computer off like that but again if it is frozen there is really not much you can do if after you have tried the control alt delete method
f8shd9ywefo_18-2-rgb_front if your computer does not have a switch on the back sometimes manufacture computers like a dell or an hp may not have that switch
f8shd9ywefo_19-2-rgb_front then the only thing to do would be to unplug the power cord
f8shd9ywefo_2-2-rgb_front first thing you can do is if your computer freezes up try hitting control alt delete
f8shd9ywefo_20-2-rgb_front most of the times you can unplug the cord from the back of the computer
f8shd9ywefo_21-2-rgb_front so just unplug that and the computer should obviously shut off because there is no power
f8shd9ywefo_22-2-rgb_front and then plug it back in and then you can leave it shut off but the best thing to do is to restart it from there
f8shd9ywefo_23-2-rgb_front and then just to make sure every thing is o k and then shut it down the way it is supposed to be shut down from there
f8shd9ywefo_24-2-rgb_front and if you you know plug it back in and turn it on and it is still frozen up then there is probably a good chance that there is some kind of virus or some corruption with your operating system possibly even your logic board or your hard drive is messed up
f8shd9ywefo_25-2-rgb_front so then you would need to take it to a computer professional to take a look at it from there
f8shd9ywefo_26-2-rgb_front but that should fix it in most situations
f8shd9ywefo_3-2-rgb_front it is kind of like a you know the best way to it is like an override sequence you can use
f8shd9ywefo_4-2-rgb_front once you hit control alt delete sometimes that alone will just unfreeze the computer
f8shd9ywefo_5-2-rgb_front but what it will do is it will bring up a window on your computer that brings up the task manager
f8shd9ywefo_6-2-rgb_front and when that comes up sometimes the program you are running has caused your computer to freeze up
f8shd9ywefo_7-2-rgb_front so it will show you what programs are running and you can just highlight one and say end task and it will kill the program that is running
f8shd9ywefo_8-2-rgb_front and that might unfreeze your computer and allow you to shut it down normally
f8shd9ywefo_9-2-rgb_front but if you have tried that and control alt delete did nothing then the next step to do would be to actually go over and hit the power button on the computer
f9osaraxuiq_0-8-rgb_front today is topic is how to choose the right tire for winter driving
f9osaraxuiq_1-8-rgb_front most cars come with a tire that look like this
f9osaraxuiq_10-8-rgb_front maybe even one that has the holes in it where they put studs in the tire for ice
f9osaraxuiq_11-8-rgb_front if you do not do much highway driving or areas where there is not so much snow an all terrain tire is probably the best
f9osaraxuiq_12-8-rgb_front if you are in an area where there is a lot of snow you might want to put the very aggressive tire on which are more aggressive and more aggressive and this one is not that very aggressive but it is a different type of tread
f9osaraxuiq_13-8-rgb_front your dealers most people who sell tires can find out the proper tire for your car according to your driving conditions
f9osaraxuiq_14-8-rgb_front ask questions
f9osaraxuiq_15-8-rgb_front do not be ever afraid to ask a question of how you drive and let them know how you drive and where you drive
f9osaraxuiq_16-8-rgb_front this will give you the proper way to get the right tire for your car
f9osaraxuiq_2-8-rgb_front they have just a nice tread on them and not very much aggressiveness
f9osaraxuiq_3-8-rgb_front this tire has a little more aggressive tread on it
f9osaraxuiq_4-8-rgb_front it is better for winter driving and there are tires with more aggressive tread than this
f9osaraxuiq_5-8-rgb_front the way to choose the proper one is to figure out where you are driving from
f9osaraxuiq_6-8-rgb_front do you drive in town only
f9osaraxuiq_7-8-rgb_front are the streets plowed very well
f9osaraxuiq_8-8-rgb_front do you have a lot of snow
f9osaraxuiq_9-8-rgb_front if you are in a place where there is a lot of snow you will want a very aggressive tire
fatxqbl65o8_0-5-rgb_front bras are bras
fatxqbl65o8_1-5-rgb_front as much as you might want to have some innovative design it is ultimately a bra
fatxqbl65o8_10-5-rgb_front it is a sports bra with a dip
fatxqbl65o8_11-5-rgb_front a cross between a sports bra and then a regular bra bra
fatxqbl65o8_12-5-rgb_front but it is all one piece
fatxqbl65o8_13-5-rgb_front so you start out with your shoulder straps
fatxqbl65o8_14-5-rgb_front figure out what width you want them and where you want them
fatxqbl65o8_15-5-rgb_front and since it is all one piece you have and actual neckline
fatxqbl65o8_16-5-rgb_front the chest part dips
fatxqbl65o8_17-5-rgb_front figure out where you want it to dip
fatxqbl65o8_18-5-rgb_front obviously in the middle of the chest
fatxqbl65o8_19-5-rgb_front make sure it falls in the middle of the chest
fatxqbl65o8_2-5-rgb_front and not that i am trying to make you not want to be creative with it but what i think of is bathing suit types
fatxqbl65o8_20-5-rgb_front and then create your cups
fatxqbl65o8_21-5-rgb_front and then do your design variations
fatxqbl65o8_22-5-rgb_front and there you go
fatxqbl65o8_3-5-rgb_front if it is going to be a bathing suit if it is going to be a bra i want it along the same sort of lines
fatxqbl65o8_4-5-rgb_front i want my underwear that i design to be able to be worn madonna style outside of the clothes and look good
fatxqbl65o8_5-5-rgb_front i do not want it to be just regular so i always include some sort of design variation
fatxqbl65o8_6-5-rgb_front such as the diagonals on this bra which makes it look kind of more swimsuit inspired
fatxqbl65o8_7-5-rgb_front and with this bra i decided not to do any under wire shaping
fatxqbl65o8_8-5-rgb_front it is going to be all one piece
fatxqbl65o8_9-5-rgb_front there is no mid section
fb33nsufbv0_0-1-rgb_front hi this is john stewart and this is the different types of fire you can learn to build
fb33nsufbv0_1-1-rgb_front there is four different types of fire you can learn and use them in different scenarios
fb33nsufbv0_10-1-rgb_front this is going to put off good heat but it is also going to help light the area really well
fb33nsufbv0_11-1-rgb_front if your tent is on one side of the log put your fire on that side and that log will block the heat and the light and it will mainly force it towards your side of the campground to where you light your area really well
fb33nsufbv0_12-1-rgb_front and you just want to keep piling wood on this so it burns really really bright and always has a tall flame
fb33nsufbv0_13-1-rgb_front and the fourth type of fire you can build is a signaling fire
fb33nsufbv0_14-1-rgb_front with a signaling fire you want to sort of combine your log cabin and your tepee
fb33nsufbv0_15-1-rgb_front this is so you have a really big base and it burns really bright and that you have an area that you can throw stuff on top of to make your signaling
fb33nsufbv0_16-1-rgb_front and this is how you can demonstrate different types of fire
fb33nsufbv0_2-1-rgb_front if you want to cook the best fire for you is use the log cabin fire
fb33nsufbv0_3-1-rgb_front this is really good because the log cabin fire is really ventilated so it gets a lot of oxygen which helps put off more heat but most importantly is the logs freely fall on top of each other as they burn and they make really really good pieces of coal that put off really good heat to where you can transfer them put them on top of a dutch oven up under it in a different location
fb33nsufbv0_4-1-rgb_front second type of fire is a tepee fire
fb33nsufbv0_5-1-rgb_front this is going to be great in case you are really cold
fb33nsufbv0_6-1-rgb_front snowy climates this is good because this puts really good heat off
fb33nsufbv0_7-1-rgb_front it concentrates the heat into the area right surrounding you does not dissipate very really very fast so the tepee fire you just pile it up just like a indian tepee and let it burn and it will keep you really really warm
fb33nsufbv0_8-1-rgb_front third type of fire is going to be your fire
fb33nsufbv0_9-1-rgb_front this is when you have the big type big log beside your fire pit and you prop other limbs on this
fcf65snmii8_0-3-rgb_front in today is economy everybody is trying to save some money
fcf65snmii8_1-3-rgb_front even when it comes to drinking
fcf65snmii8_10-3-rgb_front so my name is jeff klein vodka connoisseur and bartender here at beak is old florida and that is the best vodka for the price
fcf65snmii8_2-3-rgb_front how are you
fcf65snmii8_3-3-rgb_front my name is jeff klein and i am a bartender and vodka connoisseur here at beak is old florida and i am going to tell you what is the best vodka for the price
fcf65snmii8_4-3-rgb_front now for me it comes down to taste versatility how easy it blends with anything i want to do it with and of course how expensive it is
fcf65snmii8_5-3-rgb_front for me all of those are summed up in skyy
fcf65snmii8_6-3-rgb_front skyy vodka fairly inexpensive you can usually get it from anywhere around eleven dollars to fifteen dollars in most your grocery stores and liquor stores
fcf65snmii8_7-3-rgb_front some of the best things about it are going to be the flavor affordability and accessibility
fcf65snmii8_8-3-rgb_front you can find it almost anywhere
fcf65snmii8_9-3-rgb_front so my suggestion is next time you are throwing a party and want to bring that vodka home go out to any liquor store look for the clear easily distinguished blue bottle of skyy vodka and it is a cannot miss for the price
fck8md58lk4_0-4-rgb_front i want to show you an improv demonstration i call yes or
fck8md58lk4_1-4-rgb_front this is a demonstration in the bad stuff because really what we want to do in general is we want to yes and
fck8md58lk4_10-4-rgb_front yes or we could go out to eat
fck8md58lk4_11-4-rgb_front yes or we could go take that big paddle boat on the river
fck8md58lk4_12-4-rgb_front yes or we could sky dive
fck8md58lk4_13-4-rgb_front yes or we could go spelunking
fck8md58lk4_14-4-rgb_front yes or we could eat bats
fck8md58lk4_15-4-rgb_front or we could drive a bus
fck8md58lk4_16-4-rgb_front alright good excellent so that is a little bit of yes or
fck8md58lk4_17-4-rgb_front you can see really quickly what happens to the conversation
fck8md58lk4_18-4-rgb_front first of all what happened to my birthday party
fck8md58lk4_19-4-rgb_front it probably looks like it is not going to happen
fck8md58lk4_2-4-rgb_front we want to listen to each ideas and support them but it is useful to demonstrate what happens when we do not do that when we do something else like for example yes or
fck8md58lk4_20-4-rgb_front so what we do is we leave i keep leaving ideas behind
fck8md58lk4_21-4-rgb_front you go oh we can do this or that or the other or the other and we do not actually move in any specific direction
fck8md58lk4_22-4-rgb_front i am sure a lot of you guys have had conversations like that i find a lot of conversations about where to go eat dinner sound a lot like that a lot of business meetings where you are brainstorming or having ideas sound like that
fck8md58lk4_23-4-rgb_front it can be pretty unproductive because you do not seem to be getting anywhere with your conversation
fck8md58lk4_24-4-rgb_front so instead of yes or what we want to do is we want to do yes and but this demonstration gets you an idea for what happens when you have these yes or conversations
fck8md58lk4_25-4-rgb_front so this is a little yes or demonstration
fck8md58lk4_3-4-rgb_front so what shannon and i are going to do is we are going to have a little conversation where we are planning something maybe we are planning my birthday party
fck8md58lk4_4-4-rgb_front every line we say is going to start except for the first one is going to start with yes or
fck8md58lk4_5-4-rgb_front so i am going to say let is plan my birthday party and shannon is going to say yes or blah blah blah blah and then i am going to say yes or blah blah blah blah back and forth until the scene kind of comes to an end
fck8md58lk4_6_7_8_9-4-rgb_front so here we go let is plan my birthday party yes or we could go get your car washed yes or we could go shopping for my birthday presents or we could go see a movie this afternoon
fclqaxwjime_0-5-rgb_front in this clip we will talk about where to get information on ocd
fclqaxwjime_1-5-rgb_front one of the quickest and easiest ways is to hop on the internet in the world wide web
fclqaxwjime_2-5-rgb_front the one thing you want to do is if you type in ocd for example on one of the search engines you are going to get pages and pages and pages of information but it is not always the most accurate and correct information
fclqaxwjime_3-5-rgb_front so some reliable sources you could go to are webmd com or you could also go to a site that is dedicated to ocd which is the obsessive compulsion foundation and that website is www ocfoundation org

fclqaxwjime_5-5-rgb_front if going on the internet is not your thing you could to talk your primary physician as well
fclqaxwjime_6-5-rgb_front you could go to a local library and look up some information
fclqaxwjime_7-5-rgb_front magazine articles usually medical journals also have some current information
fclqaxwjime_8-5-rgb_front the most important thing is if you think you might have ocd or if your family member or friend who trying to find out more information about ocd really get the knowledge get the information find out whichever way you know you can so that you could get your foot in the door
fclqaxwjime_9-5-rgb_front once you have the basics go to someone who knows what they are talking about so a doctor or a therapist someone who could really help you

fdph69wpvba_11-8-rgb_front keep going keep going it feels really good
fdph69wpvba_12-8-rgb_front so then again moving with your partner is breath inhaling and exhaling
fdph69wpvba_13-8-rgb_front you might find each time he exhales he is able to come into it just a little bit deeper as he opens up through his side body just a little bit more

fdph69wpvba_1_2_3-8-rgb_front so willie is going to lift this leg up for me just bring his knee up into his chest he is going to take his arms out to the sides in a t good
fdph69wpvba_4-8-rgb_front he is going to bring his knee across his chest and over to the side
fdph69wpvba_5-8-rgb_front now as a partner your job is to keep your partner is shoulder leveled
fdph69wpvba_6-8-rgb_front and the first thing i am going to do is get familiar with his breath so that i can move with his breath
fdph69wpvba_7-8-rgb_front i am going to ask him to inhale in and as he exhales i am just going to give gentle pressure to his shoulder and pull his hip long to lengthen out through that side body
fdph69wpvba_8-8-rgb_front on his next inhale i am going to release and then on his exhale i am going to press his hip over
fdph69wpvba_9-8-rgb_front and be sure to ask your partner when to stop

fgogdmxbrbk_1-3-rgb_front in this clip i will tell you how to know a color of a diamond
fgogdmxbrbk_10-3-rgb_front this diamond is d in color
fgogdmxbrbk_11-3-rgb_front now i show you the other piece now i show you the other piece this piece is j in color
fgogdmxbrbk_12-3-rgb_front now if you compare these two stones you will get to know the difference in the color of a diamond
fgogdmxbrbk_13-3-rgb_front so as the color goes up up till d the prices goes up and as the color comes down to the slightly tinted yellow the prices will come down
fgogdmxbrbk_14-3-rgb_front so you can see the difference the shade and the prices are identically proportion to each other
fgogdmxbrbk_15-3-rgb_front so now i hope you know how to choose the color of a diamond
fgogdmxbrbk_16-3-rgb_front thank you
fgogdmxbrbk_2-3-rgb_front a color of a diamond is basically the shade of a diamond
fgogdmxbrbk_3-3-rgb_front the shades are described in alphabetical order starting from d now here if you look at the design there are d e f g h i j and it goes up to zed
fgogdmxbrbk_4-3-rgb_front d e f are considered to be white diamonds
fgogdmxbrbk_5-3-rgb_front and as we go down to g h they are slightly tinted white
fgogdmxbrbk_6-3-rgb_front and when we go to i j they are slightly tinted yellow
fgogdmxbrbk_7-3-rgb_front and as we keep on going down the shades keep on decreasing
fgogdmxbrbk_8-3-rgb_front now i show you just to give you a brief example i show you the two diamonds just to know the difference between the colors
fgogdmxbrbk_9-3-rgb_front here i have one piece which is a white diamond

fgcgx2f_epc_10-3-rgb_front so if you find a net that says avp quality or avp certified that is going to be the most durable net to use when playing outdoor volleyball
fgcgx2f_epc_11_12-3-rgb_front another thing you need to look for is who you are buying it for if you are buying it for men is you are going to need to have a certain height for the net

fgcgx2f_epc_14-3-rgb_front and the women is height is seven feet four inches
fgcgx2f_epc_15-3-rgb_front women is height can also be used for juniors or kids
fgcgx2f_epc_16-3-rgb_front also the width and the length of the volleyball court is thirty feet by sixty feet so you want to make sure that you get lines that fulfill those requirements for the volleyball net

fhpq0wyflmi_0-5-rgb_front hi my name is tim cole
fhpq0wyflmi_1-5-rgb_front i am with the austin reptile service
fhpq0wyflmi_10-5-rgb_front it sounds like a cricket
fhpq0wyflmi_11-5-rgb_front they can be rather noisy
fhpq0wyflmi_12-5-rgb_front fishermen like to use cricket frogs for bait
fhpq0wyflmi_13-5-rgb_front i once saw somebody pick up a little cricket frog and throw him out in the pond they said this was a bass test
fhpq0wyflmi_14-5-rgb_front and the water erupted and that frog was eaten pretty quickly by a big bass
fhpq0wyflmi_15-5-rgb_front so obviously they like to eat em
fhpq0wyflmi_16-5-rgb_front but they are very quick frogs live in the water is edge hop around in the mud close to the water where it is wet and in the springtime they can be rather noisy if you are in an area where they are calling
fhpq0wyflmi_2-5-rgb_front i have been keeping reptiles and amphibians for over forty years
fhpq0wyflmi_3-5-rgb_front i am here to talk to you about southern cricket frogs
fhpq0wyflmi_4-5-rgb_front this is a very small frog about that big that occurs in the southern united states and they actually look kind of like toads because their skin is bumpy or granular
fhpq0wyflmi_5-5-rgb_front and they can come in a variety of patterns
fhpq0wyflmi_6-5-rgb_front some of them have stripes on them that can be green some of them have a reddish stripe
fhpq0wyflmi_7-5-rgb_front and these are very small frogs that occur in usually permanent bodies of water
fhpq0wyflmi_8-5-rgb_front your area creeks lakes or swamps
fhpq0wyflmi_9-5-rgb_front they get their name cricket frog because of their call
fht1nhnuono_1-8-rgb_front today we are going to be learning to play portal a game by valve software
fht1nhnuono_10-8-rgb_front again i can put one here and i will come out that spot again
fht1nhnuono_11-8-rgb_front so the early part of the game encourages you to just play around and see what different kinds of fun you can have with the portal gun
fht1nhnuono_12-8-rgb_front now i need to get over here to the exit where the elevator is and again there is no way for me to get there by conventional means
fht1nhnuono_13-8-rgb_front and the orange portal is stuck in place i can not move that one
fht1nhnuono_14-8-rgb_front what i have to do now is put my blue portal over here and then i can walk into the orange and come out the blue
fht1nhnuono_15_16-8-rgb_front and that is chamber off we go to the next one
fht1nhnuono_2-8-rgb_front a company with which i have no affiliation
fht1nhnuono_3-8-rgb_front so here we have the orange portal
fht1nhnuono_4-8-rgb_front i am not able to control the orange portal just yet
fht1nhnuono_5-8-rgb_front right now the portal gun i have only shoots out blue portals
fht1nhnuono_6-8-rgb_front i can jump down here and see that there is really no way for me to get out of this space like you would in a normal game
fht1nhnuono_7-8-rgb_front there is no ladders there is no staircase there is nothing like that
fht1nhnuono_8-8-rgb_front in portal you have to come up with clever ways to use the portal gun
fht1nhnuono_9-8-rgb_front i can shoot the blue portal and make an entrance here and then i come out the orange portal which is there on the wall
fhywp4fmzza_0-5-rgb_front clancy rose all right
fhywp4fmzza_1-5-rgb_front so now that you know everything that you have to have to assemble the single americano we are going to talk about the main ingredient in the single americano which would be the beans that we are using for the espresso shot
fhywp4fmzza_2-5-rgb_front one of the most common misconceptions about espresso roast is that coffee is roasted darker for espresso which is not necessarily true
fhywp4fmzza_3-5-rgb_front you can use any coffee that you want for any espresso shot
fhywp4fmzza_4-5-rgb_front what makes an espresso an espresso is the process of making the espresso
fhywp4fmzza_5-5-rgb_front it is the extraction process
fhywp4fmzza_6-5-rgb_front it is the ratio of coffee to water being a lot higher than the ratio of coffee to water in a normal cup of coffee
fhywp4fmzza_7-5-rgb_front so for a single americano you can use whatever coffee you like and just a coffee that you are comfortable with the flavors keeping in mind that in espresso extraction any flavors in the coffee are going to be a whole lot more intense than a regular cup of coffee
fj5vo67ktnw_0-3-rgb_front okay here we are going to go over the idea of a pendulum
fj5vo67ktnw_1-3-rgb_front so if you think of your upper body as part the pendulum using these two clubs to keep my club putting club head on line here
fj5vo67ktnw_10-3-rgb_front you use the body in somewhat of a pendulum motion
fj5vo67ktnw_11-3-rgb_front so try to get that rhythm and feeling
fj5vo67ktnw_12-3-rgb_front you do not even need to have to have a ball
fj5vo67ktnw_13-3-rgb_front just think about being relaxed and moving in a pendulum motion and that will really help your putting motion when it counts
fj5vo67ktnw_2-3-rgb_front so all i want to do is take the club back and you see how it is a pendulum motion
fj5vo67ktnw_3-3-rgb_front this way you eliminate a lot of motion in your body and your hands so you can keep the putt on line
fj5vo67ktnw_4-3-rgb_front the secret to a good putt at least getting the right speed and the right line is to keep your club head from moving all over the place
fj5vo67ktnw_5-3-rgb_front so i use these two guide posts so i can keep the club on a pendulum type motion and that will help make my putts that much more accurate
fj5vo67ktnw_6-3-rgb_front there is a lot of little tricks in putting because once again these the putts really count for a lot of strokes in golf even though you may consider it the least athletic of everything you do out here they count a lot
fj5vo67ktnw_7-3-rgb_front so you have got to find a way to get this nice pendulum motion
fj5vo67ktnw_8-3-rgb_front so you are using your body to putt because you do not want to use your hands when you putt
fj5vo67ktnw_9-3-rgb_front you do not swat at it with your hands
fk3jvgvfqd4_1-5-rgb_front in the last clip i showed you how to make a desktop account for your child
fk3jvgvfqd4_2-5-rgb_front in this clip i am going to show you how to password protect the administrative account or the parent account to restrict access for your child
fk3jvgvfqd4_3-5-rgb_front we are in the user accounts and here you can see the child is account and our administrative account
fk3jvgvfqd4_4-5-rgb_front if i click in the administrative account i can create a password
fk3jvgvfqd4_5-5-rgb_front i am going to type in my new password and again type it in again and you can type in a hint word and then create password
fk3jvgvfqd4_6-5-rgb_front when you click yes to file protect your documents what that means is when your child logins into their account they will not have access to your my documents file and all the previous files that you have created
fk3jvgvfqd4_7-5-rgb_front now you have created a password for your account and when it is time to login your child will not be able to access your account if they do not have the password
fk3jvgvfqd4_8-5-rgb_front they will only be able to access their account
fqeo3mutlee_0-5-rgb_front okay the drink we are about to make is called caribbean punch
fqeo3mutlee_1-5-rgb_front first thing we will do is put ice in a glass and measure out one shot of our banana liquor
fqeo3mutlee_10-5-rgb_front and we will mix this up real good
fqeo3mutlee_11-5-rgb_front and there we are

fqeo3mutlee_15-5-rgb_front oh
fqeo3mutlee_16-5-rgb_front that is a little bit more than a little bit
fqeo3mutlee_17-5-rgb_front give it a straw and bottoms up
fqeo3mutlee_2-5-rgb_front find that real quick here we go
fqeo3mutlee_3-5-rgb_front and also one shot of dark rum
fqeo3mutlee_4-5-rgb_front here we go
fqeo3mutlee_5-5-rgb_front and some lime juice
fqeo3mutlee_6-5-rgb_front about a teaspoon of lime juice
fqeo3mutlee_7-5-rgb_front next we are going to add pineapple juice and orange juice
fqeo3mutlee_8-5-rgb_front there is orange juice and pineapple juice
fqeo3mutlee_9-5-rgb_front equal parts of both
fsftrrxuj-c_0-5-rgb_front hi
fsftrrxuj-c_1-5-rgb_front this is john again
fsftrrxuj-c_10-5-rgb_front this bullet has about a brinell hardness
fsftrrxuj-c_11-5-rgb_front this bullet here has about hardness on it
fsftrrxuj-c_12-5-rgb_front this is meant to be driven at lower velocities than this bullet
fsftrrxuj-c_2-5-rgb_front now talk about the hardness of the bullets we are casting
fsftrrxuj-c_3-5-rgb_front this bullet here was cast with a combination of wheel weights tin and antimony
fsftrrxuj-c_4-5-rgb_front what you can do is get the blend that you need from a commercial source to use with your wheel weights
fsftrrxuj-c_5-5-rgb_front this will make your bullets harder
fsftrrxuj-c_6-5-rgb_front this bullet here has more lead content in it
fsftrrxuj-c_7-5-rgb_front i can tell by being able to scratch the surface of the bullet and you can see you where you scratched
fsftrrxuj-c_8-5-rgb_front in this bullet you cannot do that
fsftrrxuj-c_9-5-rgb_front there is something called a brinell hardness of bullet
ft6hevulcum_0-3-rgb_front the marine organism we are going to identify now is the peacock flounder
ft6hevulcum_1-3-rgb_front the peacock flounder is the most common flounder that one will find around the coral reefs of florida the bahamas and most of the caribbean
ft6hevulcum_10-3-rgb_front they spend most of their time skimming over the sand near reefs
ft6hevulcum_11-3-rgb_front peacock flounders are strange fish
ft6hevulcum_12-3-rgb_front they start their life like a normal fish swimming upright with eyes on both sides of its head but as they mature one eye slowly moves to the opposite side of its body until both eyes are on one side and they can lay flat on the bottom without being noticed
ft6hevulcum_13-3-rgb_front the eyes can move independently so the peacock flounder has a great view of the world surrounding him or her
ft6hevulcum_14-3-rgb_front peacock flounders also have a very long pectoral fin on the top side of their body
ft6hevulcum_15-3-rgb_front this fin will often be raised while they are swimming across the bottom and will look like a small sail
ft6hevulcum_16-3-rgb_front i suspect they use this raised pectoral fin as a rudder as they swim in an undulating fashion just above the sand or coral
ft6hevulcum_17-3-rgb_front adult peacock flounders range in size from six inches to eighteen inches with most being fifteen inches long or smaller
ft6hevulcum_18-3-rgb_front they are most commonly found in sand flats at a depth of two feet to forty feet
ft6hevulcum_19-3-rgb_front when they lay motionless on the bottom in the sand you might not even see them until you swim right over the top of the fish which will quickly swim away if it feels threatened
ft6hevulcum_2-3-rgb_front they are distinguished by the numerous blue ringed spots covering its body although the blue is often muted
ft6hevulcum_20-3-rgb_front peacock flounders feed mainly on small fishes they find in their sandy habitat
ft6hevulcum_21-3-rgb_front they will also feed on small crustaceans such as small hermit crabs as well as small octopi
ft6hevulcum_22-3-rgb_front that is the peacock flounder
ft6hevulcum_3-3-rgb_front these blue rings are what distinguished the peacock flounder from the similar appearing eyed flounder whose rings are brown
ft6hevulcum_4-3-rgb_front peacock flounders like eyed flounders also have two and sometimes three large defuse dark spots along the lateral line of the top side of their body
ft6hevulcum_5-3-rgb_front one usually behind the pectoral fin and the second about midway between the pectoral fin and the tail
ft6hevulcum_6-3-rgb_front the underside of the peacock flounder is a pale white to yellowish color with no distinctive markings
ft6hevulcum_7-3-rgb_front the peacock flounder is a master of camouflage they can rapidly change color and shading to blend into their surroundings
ft6hevulcum_8-3-rgb_front their coloring can go from very pale when they are over sand to quite dark when they are over coral
ft6hevulcum_9-3-rgb_front in addition they will occasionally cover themselves with a fine layer of sand making them even harder to spot
furfaakjfvw_0-4-rgb_front so what is japanese green tea
furfaakjfvw_1-4-rgb_front on this side i have chinese green tea on this side is the japanese green tea which i will focus on right now
furfaakjfvw_10-4-rgb_front because the japanese drink so much green tea that they have to import from china a sencha tea
furfaakjfvw_11-4-rgb_front so what they do is they ask their chinese counterpart to produce a tea that is made the way they do
furfaakjfvw_12-4-rgb_front and what the japanese do is after they pick their tea leaves they steam the tea leaves increasing the corafil
furfaakjfvw_13-4-rgb_front therefore when you look at a japanese green tea it is greener than chinese green tea
furfaakjfvw_14-4-rgb_front from the sencha the leader picking is called bancha and what they do is they take the bancha and they roast it it is called a hojicha which is a roasted tea
furfaakjfvw_15-4-rgb_front and the bancha as well they add rice kernels and they call that genmaicha which is made from again the same style tea it is just when it is picked
furfaakjfvw_16-4-rgb_front therefore when you think of japanese green tea it is one basic style of tea that has been manipulated to create the different styles the different flavors of japanese green tea
furfaakjfvw_2-4-rgb_front japanese green tea starts with a bush
furfaakjfvw_3-4-rgb_front it is about feet high and it is picked times to times most through out the year
furfaakjfvw_4-4-rgb_front and it starts in the early spring about april or so depending again on the weather pattern
furfaakjfvw_5-4-rgb_front and that specific tea is called sincha very first picking of the year
furfaakjfvw_6-4-rgb_front and that style type of tea only lasts about to days max
furfaakjfvw_7-4-rgb_front after that they have another picking and that style tea is called sencha
furfaakjfvw_8-4-rgb_front most of the tea consumed in japan is called sencha
furfaakjfvw_9-4-rgb_front and they also export it to over seas is the style of sencha

fxiowlkhouo_0-3-rgb_front i am going to do a white eyeliner inside her eye
fxiowlkhouo_1-3-rgb_front we kind of smoked out the outside with the brown but i really want her eyes to pop especially since it is got that orange
fxiowlkhouo_10-3-rgb_front and look at the difference by just adding a little bit of this eyeliner into the eye what a difference this makes
fxiowlkhouo_11-3-rgb_front it just brightens the eye one compared to the other
fxiowlkhouo_12-3-rgb_front and it just really accentuates that orange color
fxiowlkhouo_13-3-rgb_front this is great for photographic
fxiowlkhouo_14-3-rgb_front it is fine too for going out
fxiowlkhouo_15-3-rgb_front but it is fantastic for photographic i mean it is really just going to make that orange pop and make the eye look bigger and brighter
fxiowlkhouo_2-3-rgb_front i do not want it to be too dark and sultry so i am going to use a white kohl eyeliner and it is just a soft eyeliner
fxiowlkhouo_3-3-rgb_front i am going to line the inside of her eye and what that is going to do is it is really going to brighten her eyes and make it pop
fxiowlkhouo_4-3-rgb_front just make sure you are very gentle
fxiowlkhouo_5-3-rgb_front make sure your eyeliner is clean and just go very easy on the inside of the eye
fxiowlkhouo_6-3-rgb_front if you have a good liner it is going to go on really nice and smooth and you will be able to see that white right away
fxiowlkhouo_7-3-rgb_front and look so far at the difference between one and the other it just really pops the eye
fxiowlkhouo_8-3-rgb_front and depending you can add a little more how bright you want it to be
fxiowlkhouo_9-3-rgb_front i am sure we have all seen this white eyeliner
fxluovjtm0u_0-5-rgb_front you want to find someone by their driver is license
fxluovjtm0u_1-5-rgb_front hi i am robert todd and i am here to answer the question how do i find someone by their driver is license
fxluovjtm0u_2-5-rgb_front well in many states you can not find someone by their driver is license because it is protected
fxluovjtm0u_3-5-rgb_front in fact there is a federal protection act known as the driver is privacy protection act abbreviated dppa which protects driver is licenses and information about those driver is licenses to a large extent
fxluovjtm0u_4-5-rgb_front however if you already have access to that individual is driving record you may have the driver is license information which you can then put into various databases to find out whatever information you are looking for
fxluovjtm0u_5-5-rgb_front in other words you already have the driver is record legitimately and therefore this opens a lot of information to you to find out about this particular individual
fxluovjtm0u_6-5-rgb_front one other possible source is to hire an outside third party service to obtain this information for you
fxluovjtm0u_7-5-rgb_front i would recommend that a third party service is probably cheaper than a private detective and you may consider this for the cost
fxtkhe6zrfg_10-5-rgb_front your waist belt should be pretty snug to make sure you do not fall out of it
fxtkhe6zrfg_11-5-rgb_front once your waist belt is tightened you are going to do the final step that is called doubling back
fxtkhe6zrfg_12-5-rgb_front on this harness there is a safety feature that engraved danger on the buckle to make sure you know it is not double back
fxtkhe6zrfg_13-5-rgb_front to make sure you do double your harness back take the end of the strap pass it back through the first loop and the buckle you put it through
fxtkhe6zrfg_14-5-rgb_front finally tighten your legs down by pulling the strap through the buckle
fxtkhe6zrfg_15-5-rgb_front your leg should be snug but not too tight
fxtkhe6zrfg_16-5-rgb_front last step you have the leg strap here
fxtkhe6zrfg_17-5-rgb_front this will prevent your leg loops from sliding down and becoming loose
fxtkhe6zrfg_18-5-rgb_front i tuck that up and over the back of my harness and clip it behind my right leg
fxtkhe6zrfg_19-5-rgb_front that is how you put on a harness
fxtkhe6zrfg_4-5-rgb_front the specific harness used at this gym is called the misty mountain jim dandy
fxtkhe6zrfg_5-5-rgb_front this harness it is not comfortable but it does serve purpose
fxtkhe6zrfg_6-5-rgb_front it will keep you on the wall
fxtkhe6zrfg_7-5-rgb_front to put on this harness you are going to step through the leg loops that are already in place
fxtkhe6zrfg_8-5-rgb_front once both legs are through pull the harness up so it is in line with your waist
fxtkhe6zrfg_9-5-rgb_front take the waist belt and wrap that all the way around you passing it through the buckle next through the blue loop
fy64lazcba4_0_1-5-rgb_front hi my name is lauren and i am here to talk about how to straighten curly hair when you are doing your straightening you want to make sure you use first off a hot tool so one of the easiest ways to actually go through and straighten your hair especially when it is very coarse thick and curly and especially since your hair is a little on the coarser side what is going to happen is it is going to be able to withstand some of the heat from the flat iron you are going to blow out your hair first and use a big paddle brush in order to kind of get it as straight as you possibly can
fy64lazcba4_10-5-rgb_front when you are done you are then going to kind of just smooth it
fy64lazcba4_11-5-rgb_front you are then going to move on to your next section working your way from the bottom up and it makes it a little bit easier
fy64lazcba4_12-5-rgb_front again you are going to spray it
fy64lazcba4_13-5-rgb_front you do not want to take sections that are too big because otherwise you can get lines that are within your hair
fy64lazcba4_14-5-rgb_front you are going to use your comb to guide your straight iron out because it is going to pull out any of those knots and smooth the hair a little bit for you
fy64lazcba4_15-5-rgb_front once you have gone through your entire head and you have now straightened your hair you are going to want to keep it
fy64lazcba4_16-5-rgb_front the best thing to do is t use some sort of silicone based product
fy64lazcba4_17-5-rgb_front silicone coats over your hair cuticle and prevents your hair from absorbing your cuticle from opening to absorb any water or moisture from the hair
fy64lazcba4_18-5-rgb_front it will prevent frizz and it will also prevent your hair from going back to its original curl
fy64lazcba4_19-5-rgb_front curl needs water in order to strengthen the bond so when your hair is grabbing moisture say if it is a very humid day then your hair is going to automatically start to strengthen its curl bonds and it is going to go back to a wave or some curly
fy64lazcba4_2-5-rgb_front after you are done and your hair is dry you are still going to have some curl and maybe a little bit of frizz left in it
fy64lazcba4_20-5-rgb_front a silicone based product or some sort of palm aid will help coat over that cuticle and prevent moisture from ruining your perfectly straight hair that you set and that is how to straighten curly hair
fy64lazcba4_3-5-rgb_front you are going to do smaller sections
fy64lazcba4_4-5-rgb_front you want to do small sections so that way you can make sure that you get each hair shaft from root to end
fy64lazcba4_5-5-rgb_front you are going to use a thermal protectant in order to protect your hair from the heat
fy64lazcba4_6-5-rgb_front it is very important to protect your hair from the heat because you are basically reforming the hydrogen bonds of your hair in order to make it go straight
fy64lazcba4_7-5-rgb_front you then use a comb and comb through the hair and then follow with the flat iron
fy64lazcba4_8-5-rgb_front what that does is it helps get any knots out and it helps prevent any creases
fy64lazcba4_9-5-rgb_front so you are going to put the comb up by the root and then follow it with the flat iron all the way down
fyyg6ucc-ni_11-5-rgb_front all you have to do to put it in your ear is to slide this through your ear and clasp it right there and that is your hoop earring
