0zvsqf23tmw_3-1-rgb_front,you want to do your background before you get all your objects and those should always be last
0zvsqf23tmw_16-1-rgb_front,you want to just kinda take it easy and then use more paint as you start filling in your details
0zvsqf23tmw_1-2-rgb_front,and in this segment i am going to just start paint in the background color
-f1_kdl050s_31-1-rgb_front,and if they are alone in their cages and if you have smaller pets and it is a smaller cage they cannot knock their cage over and let either the bird to fly out or they can not reach through the bars
0zvsqf23tmw_14-2-rgb_front,and you really do not need to use a lot of paint
-f1_kdl050s_24-1-rgb_front,you have to be fairly careful with these birds
-f1_kdl050s_16-1-rgb_front,there is nothing that you can do about it and it is very quickly
0zvsqf23tmw_8-2-rgb_front,and if i need to mix it down a little bit then i can always use a little bit of medium or a little bit of water to dilute it
-f1_kdl050s_2-1-rgb_front,if these guys are flighted you need to be really careful if you have them loose in your household
-f1_kdl050s_21-1-rgb_front,so you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house
0zvsqf23tmw_18-2-rgb_front,and this entire mural is going to kinda fade in to the wall
-f1_kdl050s_7-1-rgb_front,they fly out your windows
-f1_kdl050s_13-1-rgb_front,these guys are not suited to live in the united states they are not native here and they do not survive
0zvsqf23tmw_13-1-rgb_front,i do not want too much paint on the wall
-f1_kdl050s_28-1-rgb_front,you do not want toilet seats open if they are flying around your house because they can fly in it and drowned
0zvsqf23tmw_6-1-rgb_front,and i am not going to do way solid onto the wall
-f1_kdl050s_34-1-rgb_front,so you have to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time
0zvsqf23tmw_11-2-rgb_front,i am just doing a dark hill here
0zvsqf23tmw_4-2-rgb_front,so what i have got here is i have got a little bit of benjamin moore acrylic paint and i have got it in is a flat paint
-f1_kdl050s_19-1-rgb_front,aerosols spraying for bugs spraying perfumes around the house all those sort of things these birds have very very sensitive upper repository tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol it can irritate their lungs
0zvsqf23tmw_7-2-rgb_front,i am just going to start kinda tapping it on and getting the wall color on there
0zvsqf23tmw_12-2-rgb_front,i am trying to define the edges and then kinda just it to fill it in a little bit
0zvsqf23tmw_5-1-rgb_front,and i have also got a cheap brush and i am just going to kinda it a little bit onto the wall
0zvsqf23tmw_10-1-rgb_front,i am going to start on the edge so i can get the edge painted in against the skyline
-f1_kdl050s_10-1-rgb_front,you need to be very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flighted
-f1_kdl050s_4-1-rgb_front,people get them and they only have two or three of them
-f1_kdl050s_22-1-rgb_front,and lastly they are so so tiny basically anything in your house a dog a cat anything they can get squished in a door if they get mouthed even a little tiny bit by your dog or cat or by your kid they will just squished
0zvsqf23tmw_19-1-rgb_front,it is not going to be a mural so i just want to make sure that i use less paint the farther out that i go
-f1_kdl050s_1-1-rgb_front,the number one loss for these birds is flight
-f1_kdl050s_15-1-rgb_front,if they are heated to a high temperature they give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them basically to fell off their perch dead
0zvsqf23tmw_9-1-rgb_front,and i will just keep painting on here
-f1_kdl050s_27-1-rgb_front,and again if you are cooking and the birds are loose be careful with them landing on a hot pan
0zvsqf23tmw_17-2-rgb_front,so right now we are just kinda put a tiny bit of paint on there
-f1_kdl050s_32-1-rgb_front,like a cat might dig through the bars if they are small enough and be able to grab hold of the bird
-f1_kdl050s_8-1-rgb_front,they fly out your front door
0zvsqf23tmw_2-2-rgb_front,and when you do a children is wall mural you probably most likely want to always start with like your sky first

0zvsqf23tmw_10-2-rgb_front,i am going to start on the edge so i can get the edge painted in against the skyline
-f1_kdl050s_35-1-rgb_front,that more or less covers it just be careful because your birds are very small and much more sensitive to chemicals then many other pets are
0zvsqf23tmw_5-2-rgb_front,and i have also got a cheap brush and i am just going to kinda it a little bit onto the wall
0zvsqf23tmw_12-1-rgb_front,i am trying to define the edges and then kinda just it to fill it in a little bit
0zvsqf23tmw_7-1-rgb_front,i am just going to start kinda tapping it on and getting the wall color on there
-f1_kdl050s_29-1-rgb_front,just be careful you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage you basically bombproof your house
-f1_kdl050s_6-1-rgb_front,and when they panic they fly and they do not come back
0zvsqf23tmw_19-2-rgb_front,it is not going to be a mural so i just want to make sure that i use less paint the farther out that i go
-f1_kdl050s_12-1-rgb_front,once they get loose outside predators will get to them very quickly
-f1_kdl050s_20-1-rgb_front,and these guys only have a few breaths before they will die
0zvsqf23tmw_9-2-rgb_front,and i will just keep painting on here
-f1_kdl050s_17-1-rgb_front,it is kind of a silent killer
-f1_kdl050s_3-1-rgb_front,a lot of these birds are not tame
-f1_kdl050s_25-1-rgb_front,at least in a physical way
0zvsqf23tmw_15-2-rgb_front,you do not need a lot of paint on your brush
-f1_kdl050s_30-1-rgb_front,you make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked at for
0zvsqf23tmw_2-1-rgb_front,and when you do a children is wall mural you probably most likely want to always start with like your sky first
0zvsqf23tmw_17-1-rgb_front,so right now we are just kinda put a tiny bit of paint on there
0zvsqf23tmw_14-1-rgb_front,and you really do not need to use a lot of paint
0zvsqf23tmw_1-1-rgb_front,and in this segment i am going to just start paint in the background color
-f1_kdl050s_9-1-rgb_front,you will be thinking that every thing is sealed and you go clean the papers and your daughter son husband walks in through the front door and that bird just flies right out
-f1_kdl050s_33-1-rgb_front,and if the bird is outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine raccoons have been known to break into their cages and tear through the bars and ripped into these guys
0zvsqf23tmw_16-2-rgb_front,you want to just kinda take it easy and then use more paint as you start filling in your details
0zvsqf23tmw_3-2-rgb_front,you want to do your background before you get all your objects and those should always be last
-f1_kdl050s_26-1-rgb_front,those are most of your household dangers
0zvsqf23tmw_8-1-rgb_front,and if i need to mix it down a little bit then i can always use a little bit of medium or a little bit of water to dilute it
-f1_kdl050s_0-1-rgb_front,in this clip we are going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise
-f1_kdl050s_14-1-rgb_front,the other dangers you need to worry about is teflon pans
-f1_kdl050s_23-1-rgb_front,there is not a whole lot to them they are not that robust they are mostly feathers
0zvsqf23tmw_18-1-rgb_front,and this entire mural is going to kinda fade in to the wall
-f1_kdl050s_11-1-rgb_front,it seems to be the number one way to loose them
-f1_kdl050s_5-1-rgb_front,as you are opening the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away
0zvsqf23tmw_4-1-rgb_front,so what i have got here is i have got a little bit of benjamin moore acrylic paint and i have got it in is a flat paint
0zvsqf23tmw_11-1-rgb_front,i am just doing a dark hill here
0zvsqf23tmw_6-2-rgb_front,and i am not going to do way solid onto the wall
-f1_kdl050s_18-1-rgb_front,so if you have them in the kitchen and if you are going to cook with teflon move them to another room in the house so that you can protect them
0zvsqf23tmw_13-2-rgb_front,i do not want too much paint on the wall
